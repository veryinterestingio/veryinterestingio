		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Protons in the nucleus naturally repel each other, because they are all positively charged. They have some attraction because of the strong nuclear force, but neutrons are required to supply extra attractive strong force to hold the protons together. You can see on <a href="http://www.passmyexams.co.uk/GCSE/physics/images/atom-stability-graph.jpg" target="_blank">this graph</a> - you generally need slightly more neutrons to hold the protons together, and at some point the protons repel so much it is simply impossible for them to be stable.</p>
<p>Besides that, floating or not floating is much more dependent on large-scale structure. Either molecules or macroscopic structures need to be less dense than water. Solid beryllium sinks, even though it's the fourth element in the periodic table. On the other hand, all the noble gases would float right out of the water, despite having high atomic weights.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 2 ideas to consider</p>
<p>1) Atoms cannot arbitrarily have fewer neutrons. The quantity must be a stable configuration or it will likely break apart. So it isn't theoretically or practically possible to &quot;remove&quot; any number of neutrons and still leave the atom. </p>
<p>2) The concept of density and atomic mass are different. Each individual atom might be heavier or lighter but the density (mass per unit volume) depends on the &quot;tightness&quot; of the arrangement. It is entirely possible that a loosely packed structure of heavy atoms will be less dense than a tightly packed structure of atoms (consider the molecular mass of a gas like hydrogen sulphide compared to water - hydrogen dioxide. Although H2S is heavier per molecule compared to H2O, it is less dense at room temperature because one happens to be a gas and the other a liquid)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Important note here that hasn't been mentioned:</p>
<p>Most of the matter around us is in the form that it is due to the chemical bonds it makes, not the isotope (how many neturons) it is. The electrons form the bonds with other atoms around it, and the nucleus is largely uninvolved with this process (beyond tellung us what element we have from the number of Protons in the nucleus.</p>
<p>For example; Oxygen-16, Oxygen-17 and Oxygen-18 all chemically act the same way, so the change in isotope doesn't affect the matter we see and feel that matter. The only real exception to this is Hydrogen Isotopes, which do start to act a bit different depending on how many Neutrons are present. This is due to the fact that there is such a small number of protons and neturons in the nucleus, that adding or removing any neutrons significantly impacts the weight of the atom: Hydrogren-2 (Dueterium) has about double the mass of Hydrogen-1 (Protium), but has the same nuclear charge.</p>
<p>In your example, if we took a samle of Gold (Fun fact, only occurs naturally as one stable isotope: Gold-197) that is entirely Gold-190, it would still look and feel like normal Gold does, because chemically its behaving in the same way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Exfoliating is usually subtle, even pressure.  Scratching is usually firm and fairly sharp pressure.</p>
<p>Exfoliating is like using sandpaper and scratching is like using a saw.  In addition, the underside of your fingernails is usually not very clean and is a great place for bacteria to grow.  You're potentially breaking your skin (even if only slightly) and introducing bacteria.  Not ideal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whether exfoliating is &quot;good&quot; is a matter of opinion. It's supposed to evenly remove the outer layer of skin that is made up of dead skin cells. That always sounds so gross, but really they're tiny, interlocking keratin scales. They keep moisture in and skin oil on top, protect against damage, and keep bacteria out (where they belong, the usual skin flora is a protection against nastier germs, not gross either). </p>
<p>Remove the keratin and the skin feels smooth and sensitive, but it's also more vulnerable and dries out faster. For cosmetic reasons better be very gentle and not overdo it. You can exfoliate mechanically and chemically. Sugar scrub vs. urea f.ex. For some medical conditions like ichthyosis getting that keratin layer off is absolutely crucial. </p>
<p>Scratching lightly is no big deal. But scratching hard means dirty finger nails plough right through the whole skin, shredding cells, opening capillaries. It can introduce bacteria way deeper than they were ever meant to go, and the damaged area is a good breeding ground for them, a risk for infections. </p>
<p>Some exfoliating products also scratch. Something like ground apricot shells is way too hard and sharp-edged. Scrub too hard or overdo it with the chemical peels and you end up with abrasions/burns that are neither healthy nor attractive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some peoples skin cells just slough right off - those people don't really need to exfoliate much. Others don't - their skin cells are &quot;stickier&quot;, and when left on the skin with bacteria, oils, and the general dust and dirt that can accumulate over time, it can create a great environment for acne. Exfoliating helps get rid of these particularly sticky skin cells.</p>
<p>Interestingly, most of the responses in this thread seem to be somewhat against exfoliation, which I can understand. Most guys don't need to exfoliate as much as girls, and their hormones don't fluctuate nearly as much over the month - for example, women's skin typically produces more sebum at or around the day of ovulation. On top of that, with all the different physical and chemical exfoliators on the market, it can be easy to overexfoliate and irritate your skin. That being said, gentle exfoliation once a week, or more often, if you feel you need it, can definitely help improve the quality and overall texture of your skin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay here's it broken down. Scratching IS exfoliating, however it is a much more damaging form that can bruise and scrape off too many layers of epidermis causing irritation. Exfoliating in a proper way is more gentle and removes the later of dead cells and the surface closer to the new living cells. This being said over exfoliating is also bad, it takes them down too fast and weakens uv resistance and causes irritation. So think of it like Goldilocks and the 3 Bears; too little, too much, and just right.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The truth is, we really don't know for certain. It's kind of a drag really, not being able to just directly ask them. It also almost certainly varies because animals perceive the world differently based on their species. Some rely heavily on sound while others use smell as a primary sense. Do some babies smell different? Sound different? I'm sure there's some primary literature out there where researchers tried to control for the five senses and see if fathers could still recognize their offspring: coat them in a strongly-smelling substance or put them behind glass so they can't hear or smell them at all. It would be an interesting experiment. </p>
<p>Many mammals <em>can</em> definitely recognize each other just as we humans do, and there are some species where females routinely mate with multiple males. I believe the theory behind that just boils down to a female trying to trick all males in the area into thinking her kids might be theirs so they don't kill them when they run into a female they know they've mated with. Everyone wins.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It is said that after a foal is weaned from the mother and there is a time of separation, the mares and their former babies don't recognize each other.</p>
<p>There's no proof of any of that, but personal experience when a mother and grown baby are reunited after years, there doesn't seem to be recognition. The male will breed his former mother, although a mother and daughter will probably get along in pasture.</p>
<p>How zebras differ or are the same for horses in this behavior is unknow because wild zebras are hard to follow and observe for long periods of time. </p>
<p>Also, there are three types of zebras. two types are more like horses and one type is more like a wild donkey genetically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>TL:DR<br />
&quot; An epileptic girl with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome had seizures triggered specifically by blinking, but not by other eye movements or by photic stimulation. Electrographic and clinical seizures were most reliably precipitated by repetitive blinking produced voluntarily on command, by reflex blinking on corneal stimulation, or by psychogenic triggers of blinking such as social stress or cognitive effort. &quot;  </p>

Triggers include (but are not limited to) strong emotions, intense exercise, loud music, and flashing lights [<a href="https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults/abstract/15,16" target="_blank">15,16</a>]. These triggers are often experienced immediately before the seizure.</p>
<p>Other physiologic conditions such as fever, the menstrual period, lack of sleep, and stress can also precipitate seizures, probably by lowering seizure threshold rather than directly causing a seizure. As a result, the temporal relationship to the presenting seizure is often less clear. Triggers may also precipitate nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders, especially syncope.</p>
<p>However, the majority of patients with epilepsy have no identifiable or consistent trigger to their seizures. In addition, triggers are the sole cause of epileptic seizures in only a very small percentage of patients.</p>
<p>Photosensitivity is a relatively uncommon seizure trigger, although it occasionally receives heightened attention in relation to particular television shows or video games.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Housefly</strong> (<em>Musca domestica</em>) has a very soft, fleshy, spongelike mouth and when it lands on you  and touches your skin, it won’t bite, it will suck up secretions on the  skin.</p>
<p>It is interested in sweat, proteins, carbohydrates, salts, sugars  and other chemicals and pieces of dead skin that keep flaking off.</p>
<p>This type of fly also gets its nutrients from sitting around the eyes  of livestock. It is hard to get it from anywhere else on hairy animals,  which is also why they land more often on human skin which is  comparatively less hairy.</p>
<p><strong>Here are some reasons why they are attracted towards humans:</strong></p>
<p>- They are attracted to carbon dioxide which human beings breathe out.</p>
<p>- They are attracted to the heat of the warm body, to sweat and salt, and the more the person sweats the more flies they attract.</p>
<p>- Flies feed on dead cells and open wounds.</p>
<p>- Oil is an important food for flies. Oily hair is an attractant.</p>
<p>- Less hairy skin gives the fly spaces to vomit. A fly vomits on solid food to liquefy it. The house flies taste with their  feet so if there is food on the skin, and space to liquefy it, they  will land there.</p>
<p>- Some of the body odors are more attractive to flies than others. This is apart from the quantity of carbon dioxide that is emitted.</p>
<p>Houseflies are scavengers .The human body like some of their favourite food sources - faeces, food and rotting flesh radiates a sense of warmth and nourishment. With a voracious appetite, aided by an excellent sense  of smell and a pair of complex eyes that covers half its head, the fly lands on us because it is constantly on the hunt for a warm place to eat, defecate, vomit and lay eggs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

But in order to illuminate it needs to fall on an object and then fall on your eyes.
In the first case it doesn't need much intensity (to reach your eyes directly) but in the second case it needs more intensity because many photons will be directed in random directions after falling on the object, making it less probable to fall into your eyes, and intensity decrease with increase in radius. So u can see campfire from far, but can't see objects far from campfire.
Hope it's clear now</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the same reason that you can't see stars during the day.</p>
<p>Light is measured in lux.  Bright sunlight on snow is about 125,000 lux, and starlight on a clear moonless night is about 0.0002 lux.  You can see both of these levels of light, but not at the same time.  </p>
<p>Instead, eyes settle on a a range of &quot;normal&quot;, and have a hard time detecting light less than 1/2000 as bright as whatever your eyes consider to be painfully bright.</p>
<p>So if you are standing next to a fire, your eyes become sensitive to the very brightest level of the fire, down to about 1/2000 that level.  You see things around the fire because light from the fire reflects back to your eyes.  The amount of firelight that is available to reflect gets rapidly smaller with distance.  Also, surfaces like trees and bushes and dirt don't reflect all of the light.  So things that are not that far from the fire look black simply because they aren't reflecting back enough light for your eyes to see, relative to the brightness of the coals.</p>
<p>If you then walk very far from the fire, and wait, your eyes will adapt - may be to moonlight or even starlight if it's very dark.  Starlight is only about 2/10,000 as bright as a single candle reflecting off a 1 square meter of white surface...  </p>
<p>At that level of light even a candle from half a km away might still be visible on a clear night.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good question! Understanding this takes a little anatomical review so bare with me. </p>
<p>So, whether realizing it or not, you are constantly swallowing. Swallowing, while appearing consciously under our control (it is only initially) is actually a deeply ingrained reflex that we learn in the womb and consists of a complicated series of muscular movements from our mouth to the level of the larynx (Adams Apple). This is ignoring esophageal motility after that level. We swallow with food or drink but also all throughout the day/night with saliva.</p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Illu01_head_neck.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a> is a diagram of the pharyngeal structures. </p>
<p>and <a href="https://www.newenglandent.com/images/voice-dysphagia_swallowing.jpg?crc=4014786095" target="_blank">Here</a> is a very simple diagram of the swallowing process. </p>
<p>So as you can see, starting at the level of the Thyroid Cartilage (Adam's Apple), the trachea (breathing tube) is anatomically Anterior (in front) of the Esophagus (eating tube). Above this level there is only one tube, the Pharynx(broken down into Nasopharynx, Oropharynx, and Laryngopharynx). Now, when we swallow, an <em>Incredibly</em> important (and Neat) structure called the the Epiglottis (a Leaf-shaped piece of cartilage and tissue) folds down, sealing off the opening to the trachea(which contains the Vocal Cords/structures), and acts like a little slide to shunt food, saliva, etc. into the esophagus to then go into the stomach. This function is usually incredibly efficient as well as important since any liquid or solid substance getting into the trachea could potentially pass into the lungs. Needless to say, you don't want anything but Air going into your lungs. </p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://kidshealth.org/ES/images/illustrations/fiberlaryngoscopia-399x560-rd1-esIL.gif" target="_blank">Here</a> is a procedure called Laryngoscopy where a Fiberoptic Laryngoscope (camera) is placed through the nose (usually) to get an active view the laryngeal structures. I perform this often for anything from swallowing trouble, sore throat, cancer surveillance, etc. </p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: Real anatomical images incoming</p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iYpDwhpILkQ/hqdefault.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a> is a real image of the larynx that you'd normally see via a laryngoscopy. <a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_H3T9c3zCcFM/TRkAZy0kP1I/AAAAAAAABCc/hvjw3zezlBM/indirect%20laryngoscopic%20view%5B16%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" target="_blank">Here</a> is a nice cartoon image with labels to understand what you're seeing. Its inverted but you get the idea. </p>
<p>Do to the importance of keeping as much non-air substance out of the lungs as possible, the tissue below and around the epiglottis leading into the larynx is incredibly sensitive to irritation. The body recognizes this irritation as something being where its not supposed to be and triggers the cough reflex. Naturally, this consists of powerful expulsion of air from the lungs with the goal of expelling whatever is in there, out either into the esophagus, your mouth, or out of you entirely depending on the force. Even small volumes of liquid getting into the larynx is enough to stimulate this reflex.  </p>
<p>The importance of this reflex cannot be overstated. Disorders of the swallowing process are huge in the field of Otolaryngology(ENT) as any loss of function can lead to serious consequences and drop in quality of life, especially in older and debilitated patients. Trouble swallowing --&gt; aspiration risk --&gt; less eating/drinking and/or aspiration of food/water into the lungs --&gt; weight loss/dehydration or pneumonia/asphyxiation respectively. </p>
<p>TLDR: No it HOPEFULLY doesn't just chill in your lungs as this could lead to serious medical problems like infection, pneumonia, and death. Luckily, the body recognizes the importance of avoiding this and has powerful built-in response mechanisms to help get out anything that may get into the no-go zone. </p>
<p>Hope I did this information justice and in an understandable way. This is of course only skimming the surface of the topic though so let me know if you'd like to know more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Second, it doesn’t just “chill” there, your body is actively trying to expel it, which is why you’re coughing.  Third, don’t ever try to suppress a cough because food went “down the wrong pipe,” even if you’re in  public.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It's basically a layer of mucus lining your airways with cilia underneath that slowly push foreign material up to a point where you can cough it out effectively. It's really important for infection control and keeping your lungs healthy. Of course if you aspirate something too large it might need to be professionally removed before it causes an infection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Coughing is a natural reflex to help stop the food from staying there, because most of the lungs are empty space, and the part air flows through is enclosed. The food in there closes into that part, and blocks it up. So the body makes you cough to stir it up and try to force it out of the lung and into the right spot. While this happens, it's also being covered in a layer of mucus to prevent it from harming the lung. It's constantly moving while you cough until it gets out or breaks up enough to move out in pieces.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Not exactly, but this article explains things pretty well, I think. It has to do with your body's circadian rhythm and when you are asleep your body still tries to fight off the illness. You would still feel like trash if you were to stay up while initially getting sick (and probably worse because sleep also enables your body to better fight off illness) so the reason you feel worse in the morning is because of simple passage of time and natural progression of the illness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Combination vocal folds (and all the related structures), core strength, and vocal habits.</p>
<p>Sneezing and laughing both require involuntary, forced exhalation. You exhale forcefully by squeezing your ribcage and ab muscles. The stronger your abs, the harsher the sneeze. </p>
<p>Now that you're exhaling, air passes over your vocal folds. When you aren't making vocal noises, your vocal folds kinda sit wide open. When you're talking, your vocal folds close up and air passing between them causes them to vibrate (kind of like letting air out of a balloon. If the mouth of the balloon is left wide, it doesn't make as much noise. But if you stretch out the mouth, it makes that squeaking noise. Your vocal cords are the mouth of the balloon and the squeaking noise is your voice). I personally sound like I'm shouting when I sneeze, so my vocal tract spasms as well as my core muscles. Other people have super quiet sneezes, so their vocal tract doesn't spasm when they sneeze. Yours may spasm sometimes, all the time, or none of the time. A person's sneezes, like their voice, are determined by the condition of their vocal tract. </p>
<p>When it comes to laughing, generally speaking, you're still involuntarily exhaling, but it's a series of weaker spasms rather than one strong spasm. Since the spasms are weaker, you can have more control over what your laugh sounds like than your sneezes. Most people don't consciously try to change their laugh so their vocal habits tend to control how they sound. I personally had a really harsh laugh until I started learning to sing, which involved learning to habitually relax my vocal tract. Now my laugh is much nicer. </p>
<p>Another thing that affects the sound of your laugh is how <em>other</em> people laugh. Generally speaking, when you spend lots of time with someone you like, you tend to copy them. Spend enough time laughing with them and you might develop vocal habits that sound like theirs. Bonus fact: my laugh started sounding harsh after dating a girl who had a really terrible laugh. Thank god for singing lessons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sneeze and laugh are separate. Sneeze comes from the diaphragm to keep the heart in check. Laughter, much like voice is generated in the mind first, vs a sneeze physical first. The change of pitch is designed as a defense mechanism in both directions. It's suggested a loud sneeze and a more boisterous laugh are both embellished to protect the host during times of attack. To best answer you: free will is dead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>5.56 is the diameter of that bullet in mm. A 5.56x45 mm round is 5.56 mm in diameter, which is around .224 inches.</p>
<p>Basically, they're usually either the diameter in inches, or the diameter in mm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally, the caliber refers to the diameter of the bullet itself, either in mm (5.56, for example) or inches (.45). Now, the actual diameter can vary significantly from what the name states. And the exact same diameter, and often the exact same bullet, can be used in a variety of different kinds of ammunition; for example, many bullets used in .40S&amp;W can also be used in 10mm. The only real easy hard rule is that there are no easy hard rules. Ammunition loading handbooks contain literally thousands of measurements, variations, and sub-types.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh boy... Chambering nomenclature is an absolute Charlie Foxtrot, even for people that nerd out over guns.</p>
<p>They are basically all semi-arbitrary and half branding.</p>
<p>About the only semi-consistent point is that the first number is the bullet diamete... unless it's the bore diameter... and the bore diameter might be measured groove-to-groove or land-to-land.</p>
<p>Also, the power of the round is only loosely correlated to the bullet/bore diameter, as the amount of powder behind the bullet matters a lot more for power.</p>
<p>That said, there are a few locally-consistant conventions that are used, such as by NATO.</p>
<p>NATO chambering designation lists the bullet diameter in millimeters followed by the case length in millimeters, separated by an &quot;x&quot; (pronounced &quot;by&quot;)</p>
<p>For example: the NATO .30 caliber round is designated &quot;7.62x51mm&quot; compared to the Russian .30 caliber rounds which are designated by NATO as &quot;7.62x39mm&quot; (used in the AK-47) and &quot;7.62x54R&quot; (used in the PKM).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one has mentioned shotgun gauges yet, and they're a little more complicated. The number represents how many lead spheres with a diameter equal to that of the gun bore make one US pound. Twelve lead balls with diameter equal to the bore of a 12 gauge make one pound. The only shotgun that does not fit this schema is the .410; it is measured in inches like many other small arms. It's really a bit bigger though because you can shoot a .44 Long Colt pistol round with it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
