		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you define the “speed” of light to be its <strong>group</strong> speed (as opposed to its phase speed or signal speed), then yes.</p>
<p>Although in practice, indices of refraction only vary so much. A much better way to decrease the group velocity of light is to exploit rapid <em>changes</em> in the index of refraction.</p>
<p>The group velocity (dω/dk) can be written as</p>
<p>v<em><em>g</em></em> = c/(n + ω dn/dω).</p>
<p>So to make the group speed very small (“slow light”) or approximately zero (“stopped light”), you can either make n very large, or you can make dn/dω very large. Like I said above, it’s hard to find a medium with a high enough n to reach very slow velocities (the slowest reaches experimentally are less than 10 m/s). However you can find situations where dn/dω is huge, for example near some kind of resonant behavior in a cold atomic gas. There are now ways to produce slow light in room temperature solid-state media, photonic waveguides, etc. as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.87.031801" target="_blank">This</a> is a paper where light resonant to an ultracold gas stays, on average, 16 seconds in the system. Although I should note that this works only for certain frequencies where dn/dω diverges, and a system where a wide variety of wavelengths is slowed down to these speeds would require unrealistically large refractive indices over a large wavelength range.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>when light moves through a medium, is it only &quot;slowed down&quot; because it has to take a longer path through the medium? E.g., it has to do many more bounces, so the &quot;speed&quot; that it appears to be traveling in appears to be longer because it is bouncing and zig-zagging through a medium so the path of it is much longer? Or is it some sort of other wave-manipulating effect at play? Thank you</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/aboynamedmoon" target="_blank">aboynamedmoon</a>
		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few reasons. Medicines for mood generally (all that I know of, but I'm not licensed, just mentally ill, so) work by increasing some of the chemicals your brain uses to talk to itself. This starts right away, but it can take a while for the levels to get to normal numbers. Also, when you have the wrong levels of chemicals, you start thinking thoughts that aren't true, and they hurt you. The more you think these thoughts, the easier it becomes to think them, and the faster you can do it. It becomes a habit, like brushing your teeth. Because you do not have the normal chemicals for your brain, it is really hard to break that habit - you usually feel bad, and the thoughts make you feel worse, but because you felt bad already it can be really hard to think good thoughts. So even though the chemicals are usually at normal levels before you feel all of the effects for them, it takes a while for you to learn to think good thoughts. The good news is that any kind of thought can be a habit - so if you notice yourself starting to think bad thoughts again, you can redirect yourself to the good thoughts instead, and the more you think them, the easier and faster they will be. The thoughts and medicine work together so you can be healthy.</p>
<p>(Scishow actually has a great video on this on YouTube btw, and they do a great job of breaking things down to a layperson level, fact checking, and correcting themselves, historically, so I definitely recommend them! They talk a bit fast, so you might have to slow the video down slightly, but YouTube actually has that built in, and I would be more than happy to explain how if anyone needs it.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is stuff in your brain called serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine (neurotransmitters). Depressed people often have too little of this, or the stuff is weirdly distributed where it's sometimes too high and sometimes too low.</p>
<p>There are a few categories of antidepressants but the ones you are taking about are blocking the destruction of the stuff or improve the re-use. This will slowly raise the equilibrium, to a higher yet steady level.</p>
<p>Drugs usually force the body to directly create the neurotransmitters which will make you feel happy in as little as a minute. But this will further shorten the shortage of neurotransmitters in the future.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Whether it is muscle inflammation or chemicals, the change in blood flow isn't regarded as a good thing to your brain.

That's why ibuprofen works so well because so many times a headache is caused by inflammation in a muscle. Relax, separate your jaw from clinching, relax your neck and back, etc.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its all about the fuse.</p>
<p>Pretty much every explosive in use these days in impact resistant, that's why TNT replaced dynamite and nitroglycerin, they were just awful to work with as they would explode under moderate shocks(or extremely light for nitroglycerin).  This means that you can fill your bomb with explosives and it won't detonate until the detonator(tiny triggered explosion) goes off.</p>
<p>To get through you would want to encase your bomb in a strong material like steel and potentially give it a nice hard/dense tip like tungsten carbide to punch through the outer layers of armor.   You also want it to be really heavy but really narrow so it applies a lot of force over a small area creating a high pressure.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of triggers that can be used, sometimes you want it to be timed from first impact, sometimes you want it to punch through a fixed distance of material, sometimes you want it to hold off detonation until a short distance after it has stopped going through material so its in the hollow bunker.</p>
<p>You'd generally want to put your fuse on the back so it won't get squished by the initial impact.  You can see this on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_bomb#/media/File:Disney_Bomb_Diagram.png" target="_blank">WWII Disney Bomb</a> with its steel casing around its high explosive filler and a wire sticking out to the side to start the timer.  The Disney Bomb was also rocket boosted so it would hit the ground with higher speeds and penetrate further.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

High drag settings for low level bombing and low drag for high altitude strikes. Bombs are quite stable and can be dropped from very high altitude and if the pilot hasn’t armed it will hit the ground in a relatively safe state. </p>
<p>These fuses are usually fitted up the bum of the bomb. On the top middle of the bomb is a little wind turbine that deploys when the bomb is dropped and the fuze won’t arm unless the bomb is travelling a minimum speed. On the nose you usually have a proximity sensor or solid nose that can be fitted. </p>
<p>I used to build bombs for a living many years ago. I’m a little rusty but if you have any specific questions I’ll try and answer them.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ahhh, my kind of thread. To the OP, I was a 2w1 weapons loader in the airforce, and know all about bombs, missiles and munitions in general. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Also, the top post by r/kahBhume has already answered your question pretty sufficently. I could add more, but that is the gist.....Actually, I cant help myself. What happens is a few things. The bunker busters that we currently use in the USAF and most militaries in the world, use what are known as JDAMs (Joint Direct Attack Munitions). They are just dumb bombs that come with fancy equipment to make them super smart and capable, versus their standard configs.</p>
<p>What the top poster mentions, about the fuse and delayed ignition, is partially true. I mean, they did you a ELI5 explanation, but to give more, the fuze has a delay element itself known as an INITIATOR. This initiator arms the fuse (per se) when the bomb is falling from the sky. Once the fuze is armed, it starts a timer (set by the type of fuze and mission requirements) that does exactly what the top poster mentions...</p>
<p>Anywho, time for some fun stuff. While working in Kuwait, I had the opportunity to snap these pics of what Bunker Busters did to a &quot;fortified&quot; bunker, during Iraq War I.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/IpGiDgh" target="_blank"><a href="https://imgur.com/a/IpGiDgh" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/a/IpGiDgh</a></a>  </p>
<p>What is awesome about those pics, is that the inside of the structure was fairly unharmed. The bomb hit its intended target well within its parameters, and pretty much left everything else inside unharmed. Even the structure itself is fairly well off, all things considered. And that is what makes bunker busters, aka JDAMs so fucking cool. They are very strategic weapons, that can do far more than their &quot;dumb bomb&quot; variants. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>When both red and blue light reaches our eyes but not green, we perceive it as magenta (a bright pinkish purple color).</p>
<p>When both red and green light reaches out eyes but not blue, we perceive it as yellow - but what is interesting is that things that reflect <em>yellow light</em> will stimulate both our red and green receptors as well (just not <em>as much</em> for the red receptor as red light would) so yellow light also stimulates the red and green detectors, hence why it looks yellow.</p>
<p>In short, there are two ways to see yellow - from actual yellow light (which is between the wavelengths most detected by the red and the green receptors) and also from a little bit of red light and a little bit of green light both being detected at the same time.</p>
<p>But there is only one way to detect magenta, since there's no magenta wavelength! The wavelength between red and blue is just the green wavelength, but if you are detecting both red and blue but <em>not</em> green, it can't be a really bright green spilling into red and blue! So it must be something else. As such, our minds blend the colours smoothly as we add or remove various amounts of each colour, and this necessitates a ring-like structure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many of the answers here are inaccurate. I'm not sure I can really explain it well but I'll try.</p>
<p>The important thing to understand is that vision doesn't start with the spectrum, it starts with the three types of cones. Spectral colors don't matter evolutionarily. There is no benefit to seeing a rainbow in any particular way. Colors are for recognizing ripe fruit and predators and such, and our color perception is adapted to that. The colors we see in the spectrum are a side effect of color vision that evolved for more mundane purposes. That's why they look so arbitrary and nonuniform.</p>
<p>Not only does the spectrum not matter, evolution doesn't &quot;understand&quot; frequencies of light at all. We have three different pigments that are sensitive to different frequency ranges, but the pigments don't know what they're detecting and the later stages of the visual system don't know what the signals they emit mean. All the visual system really knows is that the color information from the eye is &quot;three-dimensional.&quot; Within the brain, those three dimensions are interpreted as light-dark, red-green, and yellow-blue. The red-green and yellow-blue pairs suppress each other (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opponent_process" target="_blank">&quot;opponent process&quot;</a>), meaning that you normally can't see a mixture of red and green or of yellow and blue. But all other mixtures are possible: red with yellow, yellow with green, green with blue, blue with red. If you see similar amounts of red and yellow, you see orange. If you see similar amounts of red and blue, you see magenta, and so on. That's where the hue wheel comes from.</p>
<p>Every part of the hue wheel is equally real, or equally imaginary I suppose. Every hue can be produced by real light striking the retina. It happens that not all hues can be produced by <em>monochromatic</em> light striking the retina, but that doesn't matter because monochromatic light rarely occurs in nature.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that they don't. Spectral colors are those made by pure wavelengths, for example a laser: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_color" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_color</a> In the picture there it's an edge of a color space. Everything else can only be made from a blend of wavelengths.</p>
<p>The color wheel is by blending the 3 primary colorants, whether they are pigment (subtractive, traditionally RBY, now CMY) or light (additive RGB).</p>
<p>It's like trying to put noise into a musical scale. What single note is a cymbal crash? They're different kinds of sound and thinking about something general into something specific doesn't work. In the case of color wheel vs spectrum, they're two specific treatments of something more general, called color space.</p>
<p>Confused already? Impossible colors exist too: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_color" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_color</a> &quot;supposed colors that cannot be perceived in normal seeing of light that is a combination of various intensities of the various frequencies of visible light, but are reported to be seen in special circumstances.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/journal-plague-year-180965222/" target="_blank">a Smithsonian article</a> a while back (I recommend reading it, it was really interesting and chilling) that explained that part of why the Spanish Flu epidemic was so deadly because it hit young healthy people the hardest. The virus infected the lungs, which made the immune system attack the lungs. With children, old people, and anyone who is immunocompromised, this was actually good (not good enough to prevent them dying, tho), because their immune systems were weak enough that it didn't damage their lungs too much. In healthy adults their immune systems basically nuked their lungs, which led to severe pneumonia, which led to death within a day or so, or even within a few hours. The lesions on the lungs caused by the immune system fighting the flu were comparable to lung damage from being gassed, according to the article. </p>
<p>The other big factor is that it was highly contagious, as flu tends to be. The killer part is that the government stuck its head in the sand and pretended like nothing was wrong, despite the urgings of basically every doctor. There are even newspaper articles from the time saying that it was just the regular seasonal flu, nothing to see here. Philadelphia refused to cancel a massive parade which brought the population of the city all clustered together outside, and six weeks later over 12,000 Philadelphians had died. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many different strains of flu, we get slightly different ones in flu season every year, that's why you need a different flu shot every flu season.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Towards the end of WWI a particularly bad one (currently called H1N1) started showing up. The war meant that it could spread very easily. You had crowded barracks, soldiers squatting in cold, wet, dirty trenches, hospital wards that were overwhelmed, trains crisscrossing every country ferrying troops back and forth, young men from across the countryside being called to centralized bases for training, and soldiers departing the front and going back home when they had leave or were injured.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>All of the warring nations censored any news of the flu. They didn't want the enemy to know that they were weakened, and if it wasn't virulent on the other side they didn't want the enemy to take countermeasures and gain an advantage.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's called the Spanish Flu because Spain was neutral in the war. When the disease reached Spain they reported on its severity honestly, so the first time the average citizen would have heard about it would have been when there were breakouts in spain. If the warring countries then took countermeasures and acknowledged it was going around their territory, it would seem like it spread from Spain, even if it actually was the other way around.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>H1N1 is one of those flus that hits people in their prime harder than it does children and the elderly. Strong adults have a healthier immune system that attacks the virus harder, which increases the risk of death from immune reactions like fever. Add to this the rampant malnutrition, poor sanitation and such, and people were more likely to catch it and more likely to die from it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Nobody on the planet had previous exposure to it so nobody had any antibodies/immunity built up to it. More sick people + more people susceptible = even more sick people.</p>
<p>Travel was becoming much cheaper/easier so sick people were capable of travelling further and spreading the disease as well. A few more things as well but that's about the ELI5 of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Spanish flu got started right as the world started to become smaller with flights and ships crossing the globe constantly in the wake of World War One. It affected young, healthy people below the age of 25 the most, presumably because those people hadn’t been exposed to similar diseases and so they didn’t have the partial immunity that older people did. </p>
<p>Most influenza, without treatment, has a pretty high mortality rate. In recent years we’ve made strides in both inoculation and curative medicine, so you’re less likely to get sick and less likely to die if you do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Social species learn to differentiate between members of their own species.  It's pretty rare when one species can do that with another species.  Some animals may sound all the same to us but sound unique to individuals within that species. I'm willing to bet that, if we could talk to birds, humans would sound all the same to them.  </p>
<p>An interesting counter-example of that has been dubbed the &quot;Crow Paradox&quot;.  You can raise a crow from the time it's a baby until adult but as soon as you set it free and it joins a murder of crows, you won't be able to tell it apart from other crows.  But, for some reason, crows are really good at telling humans apart.  Like scary good.  And no one really knows why.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As some other commenters have said, the shape of your vocal tract (respiratory tract, nose and mouth) influences the tone of your voice. This is a result of differences in how soundwaves bounce around in one person’s vocal tract vs. another’s. Scientific research shows that people can tell a speaker’s identity based on these differences. But it’s not only the anatomical shape of the vocal tract, but also how you use it. People can have different inflections, pronunciations, etc. (think of one accent vs another as one example) that can cue us into who is speaking. In fact, some research suggests that cell phones garble our voices so much that we rely on these inflection/pronunciation cues when recognizing someone over the phone. Actors have a very limited ability to change their anatomy, but they can control these cues and that is probably a large part of their ability to imitate. </p>
<p>As for animals, research out of my own lab has shown that people can tell different monkeys apart based solely on their calls. Even though they had never heard these individual monkeys before. The thing is, they weren’t confident in their ability: they would say “I have no idea if I’m right,” but lo and behold they would be right more often than chance. So we might actually be better at this than we would think. </p>
<p>As an aside, my lab is in the process of publishing a study showing that listeners can also tell different people apart by their screams alone, even without having met them! This makes sense evolutionarily since if you hear someone scream it would potentially be beneficial to be able to know who it is right off the bat. Monkeys can also tell which monkey is screaming (although researchers have only looked at this with individuals within a social group - we don’t know if monkeys can tell strangers apart). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Concerning animals all sounding alike, you've never had cats. I have two cats, and when one meows, I can tell which one by the sound of her voice. This has occurred with several cats I've had. One may have a meek, mild meow, while the other has a more robust one. </p>
<p>As for human voice artists being able to replicate other peoples voices, it has to do with a lot of internal things. Lowering or raising the larynx a bit, adding in some spit to give a gravely representation. Tongue position, breath control, also play a part. Next is matching the speech patterns of the person you're imitating. Do they talk fast or slow. My first impression was LBJ back when my voice started changing. Slow, deep, and with a southern style accent, he was easy. (this was late 60s, when impressionists like Rich Little were at a peak of popularity) One day, I got in a hurry practicing that and wound up stammering and sounding just like Jimmy Stewart. By the time I started performing, I had about 80 different voices and other sound effects at my disposal, mostly politicians and entertainers. It's not easy to learn, and takes some work. Local dialect plays an important role. Still, it can be learned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People all have unique voices for the same reason fingerprints are different; natural variation. Getting two specimens to grow exactly the same way is pretty difficult, so variations make each voice unique. Nature is replete with this phenomenon, if you cut down a tree and counted the tree rings you could find two trees that were the same age, but the shape of the rings themselves will vary, sometimes drastically. Each snowflake is unique, because as the water freezes different I've crystals form. And human appearance, facial features, etc., are all different as well.</p>
<p>During puberty boys get deeper voices due to the increase of testosterone in their bodies. Testosterone causes the larynx, a cartilage tube, to get bigger, and the vocal chords get thicker and longer, thus changing the pitch. And while women also get deeper voices as they age as well, it's obviously not as much as what boys experience, and it tends to be more gradual.</p>
<p>As far as why people can imitate the voices of others, I think there are a few different things going on there. For one, accent. If a voice impressionist is imitating a famous person they try and match the accent, which varies region to region, as well as change the tone and the pitch, much like if you were singing, to get the right combination. Then there's the cadence. Some people talk in a cadence of sorts, and getting the correct rhythm pattern also goes a ways to sounding like another person. And then there's using catch phrases, or words, or things that the other person uses. If you raise your pitch, talk through your nose a bit, match the cadence, and use the phrase, &quot;did I do that?&quot; People will know you're trying to imitate <a href="https://youtu.be/Ya2xifdO_l0" target="_blank">Steve Urkel</a>.</p>
<p>Also, in the voice imitation business you don't have to sound <em>exactly</em> like another person, often if you get close enough then that's all you need. If you put them side by side, or did more intensive analysis you'd likely find the imitation is rarely exact anyway. You likely wouldn't be able to fool voice print analysis, even with your dead in voice impression. So ultimately the voice is still unique.</p>
<p>For your follow up questions about animals I'm not sure what you mean by animals sounding like people. Most animals don't quite sound just like a human. There are parrots and other birds who can imitate people and other sounds, but they don't always sound exact either. Parrots don't have vocal chords for one thing, they do have a larynx-like structure in their chest called a syrinx, but then they have to use their tongues to finalize the sound they are trying to mimic. </p>
<p>As far as why parrots do this, they try and sound like the rest of their flock, and they will imitate humans who they are around a lot, like they would their flock. They may have also developed this function as a defensive measure against predators to confuse them by using other sounds. The most elaborate mimicry might just be the Lyre Bird, <a href="https://youtu.be/mSB71jNq-yQ" target="_blank">who can mimic a wide range of impressive sounds</a>.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, trained vocalist/singer/voice over here.</p>
<p>The phenomenon you’re talking about is related to how sound travels through your skull to reach your own ears. </p>
<p>Most people are completely unaccustomed to listening the sound of their own voice that it sounds bizarre to them when they hear it played back on a recording, though this is what other people actually hear. </p>
<p>As someone who has obviously trained their voice, and been exposed to recordings of my own voice for absolutely years, I can say that from my perspective my ‘through my head’ voice and ‘recorded voice’ don’t actually sound that different to me anymore. Maybe that my ‘through my head’ voice has more low frequency content. </p>
<p>As for doing impressions and voices or even singing, I have to say that what I hear directly in my head and what is on the recording sound almost identical when compared with my normal speaking voice. I attribute this to paying more attention. You have to pay attention to what you’re doing and how it sounds when you do voices or sing properly. As such, the effect gradually starts to be less of an obstruction. </p>
<p>EDIT: I’m just clarifying a point because some people are confusing my wording somewhat. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have to say that what I hear directly in my head and what is on the recording sound almost identical when compared with my normal speaking voice. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I meant, if I do voices or I sing, on a recording they sound virtually identical to how they sound when I hear me doing them. This is in contrast with my normal speaking voice, where the effect of different sound between me hearing it and the sound on the recording is more noticeable. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it’s not that much about the sound being exactly like you hear it.</p>
<p>When we do impressions we generally try to mimic the distinctive mannerisms of the speaker. That means trying to use high/low tones, pauses, amd speaking fast/slow in way that the subject you try to impersonate does.</p>
<p>And also vocabulary, everyone tends to use some words more often than the others so picking out the ones your subject uses gets you even more accurate.</p>
<p>And lastly there is the body language. Hand gestures, eye movement etc.</p>
<p>To make a good imperssion generally speaking you need these three things.
1) Voice/sound characteristics
2) Vocabulary
3) Body language</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
