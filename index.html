<p>I'm reading about the climate change, and one prominent argument is the connection between global CO² concentration and temperature. Afaik the temperature increases periodically because of Milanković cycles, which causes the CO² levels to rise, which in tern increases the temperature further.</p>
<p>The question I can't seem to find an answer to is this: If the Milanković cycle only kicked of the feedback-loop between temperature and CO² and both are at very high levels, what causes them to decrease again after a certain amount of time?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Jumping in because I’m not seeing the ice sheet connection in any answer here. </p>
<p>One important detail about Milankovitch cycles is that the slight changes in Earth’s orbit around the sun, the degree of its axial tilt, and the location of the equinoxes in its orbit (these are the ‘orbital cycles’ you hear about) have little effect on the OVERALL incoming solar radiation hitting Earth. Instead, they significantly affect when and where the most direct incoming radiation is hitting throughout the year. </p>
<p>This matters most in the Northern Hemisphere polar regions, where big ice sheets have formed and melted throughout the last 2.7 million years (the Pleistocene Epoch). When the orbital cycles are oriented so that these regions have mild and short summers, snow and ice can linger throughout the year and eventually lead to the formation of large ice sheets (see the Laurentide and Fennoscandinavian Ice Sheets during the Last Glacial Maximum). Now here is the key connection to Milankovitch cycles and CO2: when these big ice sheets form around the North Atlantic, they pull water out of this ocean region and make it saltier, which leads to more surface water sinking into the deep ocean. This pulls a tremendous amount of dissolved CO2 into the deep ocean, where it does not exchange with the atmosphere. This is one of the main reasons why CO2 lowers in lockstep with certain phases of Milankovitch cycles. This dynamic is also a feedback loop, because as atmospheric CO2 lowers, the global greenhouse effect is reduced, which leads to more cooling and further ice sheet buildup. </p>
<p>The reverse happens when the gradual changes in orbital arrangements start lengthening and warming Arctic summers, leading to ice sheet melt and reduced ocean downwelling in the North Atlantic. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Milankovitch cycles are based upon orbital eccentricity variations.. slightly closer to the sun during perihelion for a while and slightly farther away at aphelion at other times as well as the cumulative effects of obliquity So its a cycle that brings one of the strongest effects of our weather into effect... Solar radiation (radiation meaning wavelengths of light and energy not the radiation that most people think of).</p>
<p>So as you seem to already have gathered in the warm periods, yes CO2 would climb but not in an uncontrolled fashion.  Take into account that before man changes in weather and atmosphere gases would effect and have a feedback with life and most importantly plant life.  High CO2 and warm weather is perfect climate for trees.  What this meant was that the warming caused plant life to bloom and as the planet was proceeding back towards the opposite end of the cycle CO2 levels would start to drop and when we hit an ice age it would be heading to its lowest level.</p>
<p>Note that this leads to CO2 levels and temperature levels to not be perfect in line but in a decent correlation level.  Meaning that while cooling CO2 levels are dropping and while warming CO2 levels are increasing with a slight lag at the ends.</p>
<p>Now to see the best description of the milankovic cycles I recommend watching this video in its entirety.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Ice-sheets and changes in atmospheric CO2 (likely driven by changes in ocean circulation) are key. </p>
<p>This is a good (and very important) question, but it's not one that is straightforward to answer because the answer is (1) complex and (2) poorly understood. There are a lot of partial answers here, so I'll try to summarise what I see as the consensus view. I'll preface this by pointing people towards <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24996644?seq=2#metadata_info_tab_contents" target="_blank">this 1990 article, <em>&quot;What Drives Glacial Cycles?&quot;</em></a> by the late Wally Broecker who does a very good job of synthesising the main arguments. </p>
<p>It is relatively well established that Milankovitch cycles set the frequency of glacial-integlacial cycles, although there is debate about what sets the relative importance of the constituent Milankovitch frequencies. For those who are not aware, Milankovitch cycles are periodic variations in the Earth's orbital eccentricity, axial tilt and axial precession, which do not affect the total about of solar radiation received by the Earth, but does affect the distribution and seasonality of solar radiation. I won't go into detail about these cycles here, but you can read more about them on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> or in many other questions that have been posed about them on this subreddit.</p>
<p>Milankovitch cycles involve relatively small changes in solar radiation so by themselves <em>cannot cause any significant changes in temperature</em>. Something has to amplify these changes, and this is where things start getting complex.</p>
<p>One important mechanism is likely to be ice-sheet feedbacks. In short, if orbital/axial conditions are conducive towards the accumulation of ice-sheets (principally milder summer), ice-sheets are able to grow. Because ice-sheets are generally more reflective than the continents they cover, this reflects more radiation back into space, reducing the amount of radiation absorbed by the climate system, resulting in even more ice-sheet accumulation, and so on. This mechanism, also known as albedo feedback, can hypothetically both contribute towards the initiation (ice-sheet growth) or termination (ice-sheet collapse) of a glacial. In reality it's of course more complex than this (ice-sheet physics are complex and depend on many parameters such as precipitation and the response of the solid earth to the mass of the ice-sheet) but this is one major process which is generally thought to be important for explaining glacial-interglacial temperature changes. </p>
<p>Now on to CO2, which is what you mention in your OP. CO2 is, of course, a major greenhouse gas and it also plays a dominant role in <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/716px_width/public/glacial-interglacial.jpg?itok=19bwFcU9" target="_blank">controlling glacial-interglacial temperature changes</a>. The CO2 must be sequestered somewhere during glacials and must get released in the run-up to interglacials, but where this reservoir is and how this happens is not fully understood. There are probably four main options for this transient CO2 store: the terrestrial biosphere, permafrost, the solid earth, or the ocean. In short, the answer is probably the ocean. It's unlikely to be the terrestrial biosphere as there's no good evidence that this expanded significantly during glacial periods, and it's also unlikely to be the solid earth as this reservoir probablly cannot respond quickly enough (although I will acknowledge <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X16305015#br0120" target="_blank">this hypothesis</a> from Huybers, Langmuir and others although I want to stress that this is at present still a fringe hypothesis). Expanded permafrost during glacials does have the <em>potential</em> to sequester CO2, but it's unlikely to be enough. The ocean is generally regarded to be the only reservoir of carbon that is large enough to explain glacial-interglacial changes in atmospheric CO2, and responsive enough to explain the pace of change. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0589-x" target="_blank">There is evidence for increased carbon storage in the oceans during glacials</a> , but <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> the ocean increases its carbon storage so much during glacials is a somewhat open question. A leading theory (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09149" target="_blank">Sigman <em>et al.</em> 2010</a>) is that changes in ocean circulation related to changes in upwelling around the southern ocean due to changes in winds, resulting in a large expansion of high-carbon, corrosive deep waters and reduced CO2 fluxes from the ocean into the atmosphere. However, whilst this conceptual model could well be a critical mechanism for explaining glacial-interglacial changes in CO2 and hence temperature, it has not been conclusively demonstrated to be correct because as is hopefully becoming apparent, the climate is incrediby complicated. </p>
<p>Changes in ocean circulation may also be important beyond modulating atmospheric CO2 (e.g. through interactions with ice-sheets and redistributing heat across the Earth) and is definitely a dominant process for shorter-term, milennial-scale climate variability.</p>
<p><strong>To conclude</strong>, changes in ice-sheets and atmospheric CO2 are probably the two major controls on glacial-interglacial temperature changes, and both involve mechanisms (albedo feedback and ocean circulation/carbon sequestration) that can explain the initiation and termination of glacials. The relative importance of these processes however, and the intricacies of how they work, are still fascinating and hugely important open questions though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I understand that ice has a surface layer that's much more mobile (though not really liquid water) which makes it very slippery. This, so I am told, is due to it being a polar covalent molecular solid. Fair enough.</p>
<p>What I don't understand then is why Diamond is even more slippery, when it is a monatomic non-molecular, non-covalent crystalline solid.</p>
<p>It can't be simply smoothness. Optical quality glass isn't remotely slippery, yet rough, sharp, opaque ice created from freezing rain is still slippery even against other ice. Why is rough ice slippery, diamond slippery, but glass not?</p>
<p>And how about dry ice? It's not nearly as slippery as water ice as long as the thing touching it is also cold.</p>
<p>What about metals? Aluminium (with the oxide layer) isn't slippery. Nor is gold, steel, copper, Zinc, Lead, Alkali metals, etc.</p>
<p>So what makes ice and diamond slippery and other smooth, solid surfaces not? Is there some kind of rule for what materials will be slippery?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The factors that go into the friction between 2 objects are crazy complicatred and not even nearly understood. There is not some overall governing rule about which are slippy and which are not. At the most basic level there are adhesive forces which act between object that are touching. These are the same forces that act within solids to keep the molecules from flying apart, the strength of these depends on the materails.</p>
<p>But this is not even nearly the whole story becuase almost no surfaes in the real world are just the end of the solid, you mention oxide layers on metals for instance. These are actually extremely 'slippery', without them the metals touch, and the surfaes cold weld together. This causes problems in space but also when bearings sieze.</p>
<p>Water ice is another good example: it is slippy to your fingers at the temperatures which we comonly encounter it. This is because it melts in the contact providing a lubricant, extremely cold ice will stick to your hand becuse it solidifies the outer layer of your skin.</p>
<p>But even this is not the end of the nightmare, so far we have just been talking about adhesion, the forces that directly attract solid objects to eachother (over tiny distances). But this is just one factor that leads to a macroscopic friction value. For instance sheet ice and sheet steel can give extremely low friction if they are on an ice skate, again this is because the contact is lubricated by water. But exactly the same materials in a crampon will keep an ice climber on a verticle wall. These are extreme examples, but the point is that the shape and hardnesses of the materials also matter a lot.</p>
<p>There are other forms of friciton too, but the real problem is that what we experiance as friction dosn't actually map onto a single physical phenomena very well. The overall systems are also extremely hard to study as changing anything in them typically has a lot of undesired side effects.</p>
<p>Experiments that people have done with diamonds are normally deigned to cut out all of the other forms of friction, and look only at adhesion. This means that there is no ploughing of one material through another etc. that would cause a lot of the friction in the real world. Like someone else has said diamonds are covalently bonded, imagine eachcarbon atom has 4 hands that want to shake hands with another. Recent molecular modelling of these contacts (<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.096101" target="_blank"><a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.096101" target="_blank">https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.096101</a></a>) has shown that the lonely hands at the edges attract water molecules from the air and keep them there, this forms a lubricating layer as the bonds between water molecules are weak (ish). If you push them together too hard or try the same thing in a vacuum the surfaces cold weld just like a metal.</p>
<p>Glasses are held together by van der waals forces, these forces are way more general than covalent bonds and will try to stick to anything close. This increases the friction, but also as glass is much softer than diamond it is hard to eliminate the other forms of friciton.</p>
<p>The take home here is that 'friciton' if it is a sensible concept at all, should only be thought of as a property of the whole system including the materials, geometry, bonding and lubrication. It is not a property of a single material or even a pair of materials.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few comments explaining various ways mountains form while the planets were still tectonically active. However, even after a planet's mantle and core have cooled, it is still possible for mountains to be formed. </p>
<p>Large enough impacts can cause depressions so large that the rim of the crater rises so high that it could be considered a circular mountain range, Mercury, for example has one of the largest impact craters in the solar system, known as &quot;Caloris Planitia&quot;, which is almost 1000 miles in diameter and is surrounded by the &quot;Caloris Montes&quot;, a ring of mountains around the crater.</p>
<p>But this is only half the story. As seen by NASA's MESSENGER probe, at the exact antipode (opposite side of the planet) of the Caloris Planitia, there is a massive region of hills and mountains called the chaotic terrain. It is hypothesized (and likely true) that this massive impact caused the calores planitia and sent highly energetic shockwaves rippling through Mercurys crust. These seismic waves traveled across the planet all converged at the antipode of the impact and forced the terrain the crunch and squeeze, resulting in a large mountainous area. This impact is thought to be so energetic that it temporarily reactivated volcanic activity on Mercury which resulted in the formation of smooth, unblemished plains on the planet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To the best of my knowledge, mountains simply can't form on non-tectonic planets.
But from what we know of rocky planet formation, all basically rocky planets go through a tectonic stage. Rocky bodies big enough to become planets go through a molten phase as the materials collect and compress under mutual gravitational attraction. They cool from the outside inwards, so there will always be a stage where chunks of crust can float and move on the still molten interior.</p>
<p>Mars, Venus and Mercury all had stages where tectonic plates could exist. Mountains were formed as a result and the planet later cooled to the point where plates were not active any more. And without a weather system to cycle a liquid from surface to air and back again, erosion happens very very slowly. </p>
<p>The Appalachian mountains are roughly 480 million years old. They've been pummelled by rain and snow for many millennia yet are still quite prominent. A Martian mountain, subject only to weak winds from a thin atmosphere would erode far slower than that.</p>
<p>In our Solar System, Earth is in a &quot;Goldilocks Zone&quot; in more than just being the right distance from the Sun to have water. It is also large enough too hold on to a lot of the atmosphere it started with (so it can have a noticeable weather that collects water from the surface lowlands and rain it down on the mountains) and has heating in the core to keep a semi liquid mantle for the continental plates to float on for billions off years after it was first formed. </p>
<p>I don't know enough to be certain, but it's possible that the impact with another body that led to the creation of the Moon may have helped keep things hot and moving. Certainly tidal stresses from the Moon orbiting us has helped. I know that no other planet in our system comes nearly as close to being a double planet as the Earth/Moon pairing. The constant tug of the tides affects the plates as much as it does the oceans, it's just less noticeable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's two parts to this.  Well, probably a lot more than two, but we're ELI5ish here.</p>
<p>First, you eat the pill.  It gets broken down in your stomach and intestine, just like regular food.  Food has nutrients that get broken down into base chemicals, and absorbed into the bloodstream.  Ibuprophen, and similar drugs, break down into base chemicals just like food.  But these chemicals are special.  Let's call our chemical Mac.  Mac likes to bind to other enzymes in your bloodstream, including one we'll call Charlie.  Charlie likes to hang out with a special enzyme named Frank.  Frank and Charlie together are bad news, and cause inflammation.  But if Charlie is hanging out with Mac, Frank can't join the fun.   </p>
<p>Now, side track, what is inflammation?  It's when things swell up.  That doesn't necessarily hurt on it's own, but if there is nowhere for the swelling to go, because say, you've got a bone or some skin there, we get pain.</p>
<p>Back to the Charlie and Mac.  Now that they are hanging out, and Frank can't join the party, we don't get inflammation.  Without the inflammation, we don't have pain.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is an incredibly high level and basic description, but the gist is, ibuprofen and other similar over-the-counter painkillers block the production of a chemical that ultimately leads to pain.  Less of the chemcial, less of the pain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 2 basic kinds of pain killers. Anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen and analgesics such as morphine. They relieve pain in different ways.</p>
<p>Anti-inflammatories,  as the name suggests, reduces inflammation. They attack the pain at the source. You have a swollen knee, take ibuprofen, it reduces swelling, pain is relieved.</p>
<p>Analgesics work on the nervous system to reduce the feeling of pain. It basically comes in and tells your brain not to worry about the pain. The pain doesn’t actually go anywhere, but your brain doesn’t really care. It’s like going to sleep when you are hungry; you are still hungry but you are asleep so you don’t notice it. </p>
<p>There are also things such as nerve blocks which are much more localized. They block a specific nerve / set of nerves in a specific location. As such, you wouldn’t feel any pain past the block. Epidurals/ spinal blocks would fit in here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ibuprofen is an anti inflammatory that works by reducing swelling and inflammation in tissues like muscle. It doesn't deaden your response to pain so much as it helps remove the cause of the pain. The pressure from swollen tissue triggers pain receptors and is the cause of much of the soreness and pain from soft tissue injuries like sprains, bruises, or even tooth aches. </p>
<p>Contrast that with an analgesic painkiller like acetaminophen which doesn't do much to stop the cause of the pain, but instead reduces the activation and signalling of pain through the nerves. IE it doesn't fix the problem, it masks the pain of it. </p>
<p>Which pain killer class works best, greatly depends on the source of the pain. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If your heart needs to get stronger it will, that usually means you are in trouble. </p>
<p>Look into the physiological mechanics of most cardiac problems and you will see that most of them aren't the heart muscles failing the body, it's the other way around.</p>
<p>High Blood pressure? Your heart muscle is fine, the problem is that it is working too hard because your body is in bad shape, narrow arteries, obesity, reduced kidney function. It will keep working too, but your arterial walls aren't strong enough to withstand the extra pressure and over time will weaken. </p>
<p>Heart attack? That's a clot or blockage in an artery that starves your heart of oxygen, again it is your body failing your heart muscles.</p>
<p>Low blood pressure? Hormone imbalances mostly. Your heart muscle is normally fine but it keeps getting orders to beat slower and weaker than it is capable of. </p>
<p>Your heart muscle is so amazing compared to the rest of your body that managing your cardiac health is mostly about getting your body closer to the efficiency of your heart to make its job easier.</p>
<p>Cardio expands your blood vessels and improves your circulation. It improves your bodies efficiency at using oxygen and dealing with the by products of anaerobic exercise. It means that your heart gets to take it easy.</p>
<p>An incredibly healthy cardiovascular system is one you are likely to find in people with low excess body weight, active lifestyle, and a good diet that doesn't tax their metabolic systems. This hypothetical person will have a slow heart rate with a strong &quot;beat&quot; but not high blood pressure. Because the body is up to snuff and will have vessels large enough to allow blood to flow easily and a body efficient in using it.    </p>
<p>TLDR; You heart is so powerful, efficient, and sexy that it mostly doesn't need to improve, it's your scrub-ass &quot;everything else in your body&quot; that fails your heart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The better you can conserve resources, the better your chances of survival generally speaking, which means that evolution favours those who make the most efficient use of what they've been dealt. Essentially, the body will do the absolute bare minimum it needs to do to keep you healthy (although it is not equipped to deal with the extremely sedentary and indulgent lifestyle of modern humans). If the body doesn't need to reinforce the heart, then it won't do so, because doing so would be spending energy for no perceived purpose. It's important to note that evolution has a very hard time selecting traits that only manifest after reproduction, since these traits have no effect on how likely your genes are to be passed on. Since the negative effects of a sedentary lifestyle only really come out in full after the typical human has already has children, they never get selected out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There are a myriad of benefits to exercise, and one of them is achieved by the increased blood volume that occurs in your body as a response to physical activity. Your heart having to push more blood through the body triggers a strengthening adaptation response similar to working out your muscles, where parts of it get larger and stronger.</p>
<p>This increases your heart's overall blood pumping capacity, lowering your resting heart rate and blood pressure, increased oxygen delivery throughout the body, etc. Sitting there doing nothing with a high heart rate doesn't achieve any of that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Once the measles virus gets onto the mucous membrane, it will infect epithelial cells in the trachea or bronchi. It uses a surface protein named hemagglutinin (H protein), to bind to a target receptor on the host cell, which could be CD150, aka signaling lymphocyte activation molecule or SLAM, which is located on immune cells such as B or T cells. Once it's bound, the fusion/chimeric protein helps the virus fuse with the membrane and eventually get inside the cell. The virus is a single-stranded negative-sense RNA virus which means it first must be transcribed by RNA polymerase into a positive-sense mRNA strand.</p>
<p>Next, it's ready to be translated into viral proteins, wrapped in the cell's lipid envelope, and sent out as a newly constructed virus. In a period of days, the measles virus will spread through the local tissue and will be picked up by dendritic cells and alveolar macrophages, and carried from that local tissue in the lungs to the local lymph nodes. It will then continue to spread, eventually getting into your blood and spreading to even more long tissue, as well as other places such as the intestines or brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, a good question to ask is: how do cells in your body stay together, organize themselves and know other cells are ‘self’ (i.e. not foreign)? </p>
<p>The answer is that every cell in the human body expresses a set of cell surface proteins that hold cells together, identify them as part of the body (self) and identify what type of cell they are. In fact, their development is tied to these cell surface proteins as well. So as a cell develops it produces the right types of cell surface proteins that then identify it as being the correct type of cell. If there is any contradictory data during development the cell is usually killed off. In fact, in T cell development, 98% of T cells don’t develop the correct suite of cell surface proteins and are subsequently apoptosed. </p>
<p>Most viruses use one or more of these cell surface proteins to bind to the target cell to infect it. In the case of measles, it uses a protein that’s part of its capsid coat, hemagglutinin, to bind to a protein on the surface of T cells called Signaling Lymphocyte Activating Molecule ( SLAM or CD150). There are other target receptors such as CD46 which is found on every nucleated cell in the human body. But for the immune system, SLAM is probably the route that measles uses that allows it to infect both T &amp; B cells specifically. After the nucleic acid gets into the cell, it incorporates itself into the DNA in the cells nucleus and begins mass producing nucleic acids and proteins to make new viral particles. This part is fairly uniform across viruses, there two approaches, direct incorporation of DNA into the cells genome or it transmits a strand of RNA into the cell then uses a protein called reverse transcriptase to form a DNA strand that is then incorporated into the cells genome. </p>
<p>EDIT: as I did this without looking something up I made one mistake. Measles doesn’t bother with reverse transcription. It merely ‘reverse transcribes’ mRNAs off of a template RNA. So it never creates a DNA copy of its genome. The template RNA is known as a ‘reverse sense’ strand as it is the complement of the mRNAs it produces that actually make the proteins in measles. </p>
<p>Once the mRNAs are made, the cells machinery is coopted to form large quantities of RNA and proteins to form viral particles. Ironically, cells have a pathway that activates so a specific set of cell surface receptors are activated to inform the immune system that the cell should be killed. So the cell surface receptors are both the problem AND the solution. </p>
<p>The immune response is to kill our own infected lymphocytes. Except T cells hold our immune ’memories’ of cellular infections and B cells hold our ‘memories’ of viral infections. So as we kill off these infected cells, we end up losing some to all of our immune ‘memories’ of previous infections. This makes measles particularly nasty as if you survive it you may no longer be immune to things you were previously exposed to, like chicken pox. As an example, you could get chicken pox, develop immunity, get measles and survive, BUT then get chicken pox a second time because you lost your immunity from the first exposure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the DJ, some will premix a set of tracks at home or a studio, push play, and act the part. What most do, requires quite a bit of skill. DJs get a bad rap but it takes some talent to be good. What you have in front of you is a multi channel mixer. This is ELI5 so let's keep this simple, this is a 2 channel mixer. One song is playing on the first mixer, and the DJ is cueing up the next one on the other side. What he is hearing in his headphones is not what is being played to the audience but either the next song or both tracks at once, and he is trying to match the beat to the current track, find the right time to blend them together for a seamless transition, add pitch, tone, bass, effects, slow one track down, speed one up.. Ect. He/she is working on making sure the beat don't stop because that's what kills the party. Another point to make is he is watching, and playing for the audience, some things work some don't so the DJ has to be reactive to what he is observing with the crowd. Now multiply all that to 4 our even 6 channels and you got work son.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It helps to know a bit of the history behind what we now think of when we talk about DJing. Hip hop was invented when DJs like Grandmaster Flash developed techniques to match the beats of 2 songs, extend a breakdown using 2 copies of a record, rhythmic scratching etc. Those DJs were all about developing cool techniques to make a bit of a collage with their sets. Grandmaster Flash's Adventures on the Wheel of Steel was essentially a single-length version of one of these sets. Keep in mind that at this point, the records these DJs played hadn't been produced especially for DJs. This is in contrast to dance music, which is a different culture and different technique. Dance music sets were (and still are) about long, flowing sets, and playing the hottest new tracks. Dance music producers are made or broken by DJs, so they started to kind of standardise their tracks. Same tempo, same arrangement, same intro, same outro. This enabled DJs to very easily transition between tracks and make 6 hour sets. This is why dance music is split up into a thousand sub genres - they're essentially DJ templates. So no, dance music DJs don't do a lot. It's more about knowing the hottest new tracks, and picking the right tracks at the right times in your set. Beat matching 8 bars of music that already have the same beat and tempo is easy. Keeping a party going with 6 hours of music isn't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s kind of 2 types:</p>
<p>1: some DJs will pick the tracks as they go depending on a number of factors, including their read of the crowd. (Some tracks may be their own if they produce music as well, but often it’s other artists tracks). They’ll mix the tracks together as seamlessly as possible and maybe add in some tweaks here and there. This includes looping, key and beat matching and all that. Some DJs use vinyl, in which case the above are impossible (in the case of looping) or very difficult (key and beat matching)</p>
<p>2: they’ll do all of the above in private beforehand to remove any mistakes, then during the event just hit play and pretend to be doing things. Maybe a minor adjustment here and there. </p>
<p>TLDR: not much. Truly talented DJs will also produce their own music, in which case they’re more an artist than a DJ.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Usually there’s a production house or company that does the production. They hire and pay the crew. Maybe there’s a director in-house. The producers are usually in-house so they have salaries. The rest of the crew usually works with day rates. So let’s say a movie takes 14 days to shoot. They send an invoice of their day rate x14.</p>
<p>On long projects that last multiple weeks I might send multiple invoices to get paid in parts.</p>
<p>Most of the people are freelancers who just get hired. In terms of equipment. Most of the gear will be rented from a camera rental company and that invoice also gets paid by the production company. Including all extra expenses like food, travel costs etc etc etc.</p>
<p>In the end everything is paid for by production. From preproduction to shoot to edit. All expenses go through the producer/production company.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actor/artist here. The answer is always, &quot;it depends.&quot;</p>
<p>First, you have the studio that wants a movie. For this example, let's say Universal wants to make Ryan Reynolds Walks Away From Cars in Slow Motion. And it's just a movie of Ryan Reynolds walking away from cars in slow motion. Awesome. Ryan Reynolds pitched it. Or a writer sold the script to a production company and the studio said, &quot;yes!&quot; Something like that.</p>
<p>They'll team up with a production studio to actually produce the film. Let's say Hot &amp; Sexy Pictures is going to produce the film.</p>
<p>Every production puts together a budget to start. There are &quot;below the line&quot; staff. Art department, costumes, crew, production, lighting, post production, the person who coifs Ryan Reynold's hair. These are the people who, though their work is extraordinary valuable and amazing, are replaceable. You don' t lose a shoot day if you can't get the same grip two days in a row or if your VFX house quits on you. Generally the crew and artists are paid through a payroll company who makes sure they have a check every week. Productions will often use payment processing companies to deal with their payments/checks. But that's how they get paid. If it's a nice union shoot, you'll often hear stories of people on set getting paid more if the shoot goes longer. Double time after 10 hours. Golden Time after 16 where you're getting paid an insane amount. Sometimes you're paid a salary. That's a guaranteed amount up to a 12 hour day. So if you work 3 hours or 12 hours, you get the same amount.</p>
<p>Then there are the &quot;above the line&quot; costs. These are the people who cannot be replaced (well, easily). Ryan Reynolds walking away from cars in slow motion wouldn't work if they replaced him with Steven Segal. You can't just replace Michael Bay with Tommy Wiseau. Other players above the line would include your director, editor, writer, director of photography (DP), producer. Most of the unions in this world will make sure everyone is paid a base amount. But if they have agents, as most will, their costs may vary. SAG scale for a film is something like $63,000 for a starring role. Day players, costars, guest stars, featuring, smaller role actors like me generally get a different day rate and are paid within 60 days. But for the leads it's different. And generally you're paid after (unless your agent negotiates different). But Ryan's agents can say to the studio, &quot;he'll easily bring in $20 million on advertising himself shirtless in front of an explosion. Therefore he requires $10 million at least.&quot; The director can say the same. The producer, dp, editor can have a great track record and negotiate their earnings based on their track record or desirability.  So they're paid a base amount, but may earn more if their record, work, perceived value is higher.</p>
<p>During these negotiations, you may hear of these guys negotiating &quot;points.&quot; These are percentages points of a film. So say Ryan says, &quot;I'll just earn $1 million to save on your budget to start, but I'll take 10% of the film's gross profit.&quot; Well, if the film earns a billion dollars, Ryan walks away with $100 million dollars. If it's gross profit (basically all the money that came into their hands), he's great. If it's net profit (profit after all expenses are paid), you'll hear of people getting screwed out of money. &quot;Sure, we earned a billion dollars. But that was at least... uh.... let me make up a number here... $999 million in costs?&quot; 10% of a million is a lot different from 10% of a billion. And those will get paid out generally within a certain period of time required by their contracts or law. So when you hear of Jack Nicholson making $50 million off of Batman, or Keanu making $100 million off the Matrix, it's usually because of a deal like that.</p>
<p>As an actor, I'll get something called &quot;Residuals.&quot; Say I have one line as Ryan's chest waxer in the film. I get paid for the day. And because I'm in a union, I'm required to be paid a percentage of the earnings. Only a much, much, much smaller percentage. Say the movie airs all over HBO after its theatrical run. I'll get paid a small amount for every airing. So I could see myself getting paid thousands on top of what I already earned. Or, for something I did years ago, I might just make a few cents for an airing in Australia at 2am. Writers often have this same deal. A lot of people will think that's kind of ridiculous. But, it's how we earn our money. As an actor, if I were paid $30/hr to be on set on a feature film, that'd sound great to anyone else! But that might just be 2 days on set. We could go a whole year without acting on camera after that. Years of theatrical training and auditioning for free at my expense to only be hired for a scene in NCIS. The industry is set up for us to not work consistently. So, that's why we get paid in a non-traditional way.</p>
<p>The production company itself isn't paid every week. Generally they'll work out a deal of how they're paid. Often it's something like 50% up front, payments after certain parts of delivery, then the rest upon delivery. Then they have to make sure the bills are paid, but still are responsible for delivering the final product.</p>
<p>And, it is Hollywood. You'll hear a lot of weird stories. Like that one of Kal Penn getting paid in a sack of cash. That's not the norm.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Film crew gets paid like any other job, generally with a paycheck and time cards. The top-billed people usually have a base amount they get paid, plus percentages if their name matters. Production companies get fat checks to pay everything for the studio.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nice this is something I can answer! I work as a camera assistant in tv and film in NYC.</p>
<p>So all productions are run as an individual business. That is, if I am hired by a show that  airs on Netflix or HBO I'm not paid by Netflix or HBO, but through payroll by the corporation created for that production. For example, I did a few seasons of Orange is the New Black and my employer was &quot;Lady Prison Productions.&quot; But technically on my tax returns, my employer is really the payroll company Entertainment Partners. </p>
<p>So at the end of the year when I get my W2s, I get one for each payroll company. So even though I worked on OITNB, The Deuce, and Succession in 2018, they were all paid through the same payroll company and the income from all of those shows appears on one W2.</p>
<p>As far as the wages, I am a member of a union, International Cinematographers Guild Local 600. They negotiate rates with producers to determine scale rates depending on the project. So a movie of a certain low budget can work on a &quot;tier contract&quot; and pays their technicians less hourly than a $30 million movie under the &quot;majors contract&quot; aka &quot;the basic agreement.&quot; Under most contracts the first eight hours are paid at straight time, the next four are paid at 1.5x and anything after 12 hours is paid at double time. So as a 2nd Assistant Cameraman I am making about $50/hour at straight time, but for a 14 hour day it's really 8 + (1.5 x 4) + (2 x 2) so paid effectively 18 hours. 12 hours is a normal day although it really varies show to show-- Blue Bloods we averaged 9 or 10 hours but I just did a pilot where the shortest day was 14.</p>
<p>My expertise is with the &quot;below the line&quot; technicians (basically everyone except actor writer director producer) so I'll leave it at that. Hope that helps on that front :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, it's not true that any ape has ever learned sign language.  Some apes have learned to mimick a limited lexicon of signs, but that would be like you learning 200 words of Spanish and saying you knew the language even though you didn't know what order the words go in or any of the morphology or syntax of Spanish.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even the ability to repeat a limited set of signs is disputed in the case of Koko, as only her keeper could interpret the signs and she never published peer reviewed research.</p>
<p>There are bonobos that have learned impressive numbers of symbols and signs, but again they do not know sign language.  They are unable to combine signs into sentences, or learn morphology or syntax or any number of other characteristics of language.  Other primates seem simply to not have the capacity to acquire human language.  </p>
<p>In all cases, it's pretty difficult to know or prove that apes actually know what the signs they do learn mean in the same way that humans know what words mean.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
