<p>Does this indicate that I am at risk of infection from airborne sources, specifically corona virus?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No it does not. You should know about the types of filtration. There is <em>physical</em> filtration, where particles are blocked, and then there is <em>chemical</em> filtration, where molecules are blocked or are adsorbed onto something / absorbed into something, or reacted with something, and prevented from coming through. Think of it this way: if you mix a bunch of clay into water and stir it up, the water turns opaque. You can run this through fine enough a filter, and all the clay particles (which are tiny flakes) can be filtered out. However, if you dissolve molasses into the water, no amount of <em>physical</em> filtration will get the molasses out. For that, you need a <em>chemical</em> filter.</p>
<p>In contrast, you can chemically filter something, while not really physically filtering it. One example of chemical filtration is activated carbon. If you put water that has a dissolved chemical into a vessel with aquarium carbon (activated carbon), the activated carbon will adsorb (stick things to its massive amount of internal surface area) the molecules of stuff from the molasses and draw it out of the water. But the nuggets of activated carbon won't physically filter your water if it is muddy. You still need physical filtration for that.</p>
<p>Those respirators can be fitted with either P100 physical filters, or the organic vapor filters which have a pack of activated carbon in them to adsorb odors. </p>
<p>Since the kind of threat that will infect you with the virus are droplets and aerosols, physical filtration will suffice. It is not an odor or a molecule that causes COVID-19. </p>
<p><strong>Extra explanation about activated carbon: what is it? And why is it so good at chemical filtration?</strong></p>
<p>Activated carbon can be made of either coal or charcoal. The term &quot;activated&quot; in this sense means that it has been treated to massively increase its porosity and adsorptivity (which some people speak of in terms of &quot;surface area&quot;). (In the case of activated carbon, we use the term &quot;adsorb&quot; with a 'd' rather than &quot;absorb&quot; because adsorption means adhering things to a surface, whereas absorb means to pull something into something else. The distinction may seem a bit arcane, I'm just being technically correct because otherwise an even bigger nerd than me will come by and say &quot;actually...&quot;)</p>
<p>The way charcoal or coal get activated is by being used to carry out <a href="http://www.allpowerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Reduction-Reactions.png" target="_blank">reduction reactions</a>. </p>
<p>CO2 + C --&gt; 2 CO</p>
<p>H2O + C --&gt; H2 + CO</p>
<p>(In this case, &quot;reduction&quot; is the opposite of &quot;oxidation&quot;. We're not using it in the sense of making something less.) When carbon is heated to high temperatures, it develops a strong affinity for oxygen. This affinity is so strong that carbon will pull oxygen right off of carbon dioxide and water vapor, reducing them to carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Charcoal or coal that is to be activated is heated and exposed to super-heated CO2 and/or H2O, and when these molecules collide with the solid carbon, every collision site ends up losing a carbon atom as the carbon at the collision site reacts with the O from CO2 or H2O, coming off as CO (carbon monoxide). The result is that carbon materials that have been exposed to reduction reactions for an extended period of time get nano-perforated from all of these collisions with CO2 or H2O pulling off individual carbon atoms, becoming highly porous at the molecular scale, with lots of sites where chemicals can get caught and can react with open bonds made available through the reduction reactions. This is why activated carbon is such a fantastic chemical filter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you're describing is accomplished using the magic technique of <strong>educated guessing</strong>. It's not physically possible to know what color something is certainly supposed to be simply from the data in a black and white image or video, but you can use clues related to context of each object to determine what color it should be such as uniforms from a specific period typically being one color. This guessing process can be done by humans or machines, it's ultimately the same fundamental concept of using context.</p>
<p>Our brains are fairly lazy so even if there are numerous errors in this transformation we aren't bothered by them.</p>
<p>If you're asking how technically it's possible to change a gray pixel to a colorized one, the gray tones are just mapped onto some selected shade of a color. So dark gray becomes dark red, light gray becomes light red etc within some boundary. The objects and their components are just separated by a set of boundaries which determine what color they should be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In chemistry, there is this thing called 'osmotic pressure'. If you have two containers of water, one with a lot of salt and one without, and they are connected in a way that would let the water through but not the salt, then osmotic pressure tends to push water from the not salty container to the salty container. There can be other things affecting the water; for example if the salty container is under more mechanical pressure, it can make water flow from the salty container to the non-salty container (this is 'reverse osmosis')</p>
<p>Fish tend to be more salty than freshwater, and less salty than salt water, so freshwater fish have adaptations to push water out of themselves, and saltwater fish have adaptations to pull water into themselves. If you put a freshwater fish in salt water, it will push out too much water and die of dehydration. If you put a saltwater fish in fresh water, it will pull in too much water and drown.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how when you take a bath, and you play with your toys for a long time, your fingers get all pruney? Something similar happens with fish.<br />
There is salt in your body. When you play in the tub, the freshwater in the tub, is absorbed by your body, to try and dilute the saltiness to match the water in the tub. This is called osmosis. When your fingers absorb all that extra freshwater, they puff up and get all wrinkly.<br />
If you put saltwater fish into freshwater, they will absorb excess amounts of water through their skin. They will puff up just like your fingers do in the tub. Sometimes, this can kill them, but there are some fish that are used to it, the same way that you don't die from taking a bath.<br />
If you put freshwater fish in salt water, the opposite happens. The water in their bodies gets pulled out into the salty surroundings. Without water in thier bodies, they die.<br />
High levels of salt is toxic to many things.<br />
Before refrigerators were invented, people used to put salt on the outside of meat, because the salt would draw out and moisture in the meat, and preserve it. It would also kill any germs on the meat, by pulling the water out of them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

That venturi is connected by a small tube to a hole near the end of the nozzle. The hole is on the side of the nozzle, not the big hole that the fuel comes out of. While you're pumping fuel the venturi pulls air into that small hole.</p>
<p>When the tank gets full enough that the fuel level comes up to the end of the nozzle, fuel starts to get sucked into that little hole. Fuel is way denser than air. This causes a pressure change inside the handle that actuates a spring-loaded mechanism to shut off the valve inside.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

When you start feeling better, you know they're working but likely not all the germs have been killed yet.

Those few bugs left behind were the ones most resistant to the antibiotics and they're the ones that will multiply. Sometimes people get a second infection because of this, or they pass it to someone else. Every time this happens, the drugs have less of an effect because the infection was built off the strongest bodies of the last infection. </p>

<li>Keep taking the antibiotics:  Eventually 100% of the germs will be dead and you will be cured.</li>
<li>Stop taking the antibiotics:  The 10% survivor germs breed back up to 100% numbers and make you sick again.  Since the lucky germs are more likely to be in the survivor group, they pass on their lucky genes to large numbers of children / grandchildren / great-grandchildren germs.

<p>Taking all your antibiotics makes you better.</p>
<p>Stopping early risks you getting sick again from the survivor germs.  And it also risks you breeding resistant germs that antibiotics can't fight.  That's a serious problem, both for you and for anyone you pass your germs on to.</p>

<p>Essentially bacteria become resistant to antibiotics ONLY in the presence of antibiotics. If you are not taking antibiotics they can not become resistant. Therefore if you are feeling better before having consumed the full course of antibiotics, it is better to stop taking the antibiotics, monitor how you feel and if you feel fine from that point on, you do not need anymore antibiotics. If however you begin to feel sick again you resume taking the antibiotics. Though in a majority of cases once you're feeling significantly better, it's because you are cured.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The question is somewhat flawed, because they actually do mix... sort of. Where they interact at the straits of Gibraltar, vast amounts of water flow from the Atlantic into the Mediterranean, but distinct layers of water have developed because of the difference in salinity (and therefore density), which causes them to differentiate; they do mix farther from the straits as currents bring the water farther away. There is a constant interchange between the two bodies, though the input from the Atlantic greatly outweighs the Mediterranean's input into the former.</p>
<p>If you look at a current map of the region, you'll see that water is always flowing from the Atlantic into the Mediterranean, and as you travel east the salinity of the water increases because water is constantly evaporating, and the input of fresh water from rivers is not strong enough to outweigh it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Relevant article: <a href="https://www.grida.no/resources/5915" target="_blank">Surface circulation in the Mediterranean</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the past, the straits of Gibraltar have raised above sea level by tectonic action, and the Mediterranean has actually dried up (though with some water left from river sources) due to the lack of input from the Atlantic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Relevant Wikipedia page: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messinian_salinity_crisis" target="_blank">Messinian Salinity Crisis</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is not to say that all water in that region is flowing into the Mediterranean, though. Because the water of the Mediterranean is so salty, some of it sinks below the Atlantic inflow and flows out of the straits. These outflows are redirected north and form significant salt deposits along the Spanish continental shelf.</p>

<p>Take a look at Thermohaline Circulation. As waters with different temperature and salinities come together, their different densities cause them to move up and down vertically to come to equilibrium. This is “mixing” but on a very large scale. The same type of situation happens with you put hot and cold water into a glass. The hot water rises, and the cold water sinks. But it’s a small amount so they mix and come to equilibrium quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So straight off the bat the fact that thousands of people get great results isn't evidence for anything. There are a huge number of plainly quack nonsense (e.g. homeopathy) that thousands of people swear by.</p>
<p>So why does chiropractic get a hard time. Probably three main reasons.</p>
<p>1) It is a fact that chiropractic was founded on nonsense. One of the primary foundations of chiropractic is that &quot; vertebral joint misalignments, [called] <em>vertebral subluxations</em>, interfered with the body's function and its inborn ability to heal itself. &quot; People have actively searched for subluxations, and found no evidence for their existence. Even the Chiropractic Council admits &quot;[vertebral sublucations are] not supported by any clinical research evidence that would allow claims to be made that it is the cause of disease &quot;.  There are too many examples of the explicit quackary in the history of chiropractic, but another one worth noting is that the founder of chiropractic, D.D Palmer, prior to inventing chiropractic, also told people he could cure their ills by waving magnets over them.</p>
<p>2) Many proponents of chiropractic will say that medicine has a history of stupidity, and chiropractic has improved. The answer to that is that while some chiropractors have moved away from the nonsense that is the foundation of chiropractic, many do not, and adhear essentially exactly to what D.D Palmer said in the 1890s. But lets say they are right, how effective is chiropractic now? Well studies have repeatedly found that chiropractic treatments are no better than any other approach for lower back pain, and [actively useless]( <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2829683/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2829683/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2829683/</a></a> ) for things like asthma (which yes, chiropractors believe they can treat by adjust the spine.</p>
<p>3) Chiropractors associate themselves with other quackery. [Anti Vax]( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-vaccinationism_in_chiropractic" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-vaccinationism\_in\_chiropractic" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-vaccinationism\_in\_chiropractic</a></a> ) views are regularly held by chiropractor. Belief in homeopathy is also [rife amongst chiropractors]( <a href="https://theamericanchiropractor.com/homeopathy-a-perfect-partner-for-chiropractors-who-work-with-athletes/" target="_blank"><a href="https://theamericanchiropractor.com/homeopathy-a-perfect-partner-for-chiropractors-who-work-with-athletes/" target="_blank">https://theamericanchiropractor.com/homeopathy-a-perfect-partner-for-chiropractors-who-work-with-athletes/</a></a> ).</p>
<p>There are lots of other reasons why chiropractic is viewed as quackery, but this list should get you started.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>due to loose regulatory oversight, chiropractors can do everything from relieving pressure due to back injury which will allow you to function better and move more easily while it heals, to claiming asthma that can be cured by them cracking your back and selling you water that has been turned into medicine by letting a crystal soak in it for awhile.  Often chiropractors find that catering to the people who believe in pseudoscience pays better than restricting their services to the more legitimate procedures only.  The less corrupt ones would argue that they are just giving people what they want and at least they are getting some placebo effect from it.  the more corrupt ones are convincing overly trusting people that their snake oil is better than modern medicine and all they have to do is continue to pay for treatments for the rest of their life for this chronic issue and keep up-selling more and more crap as they fall for the next scam.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>My research showed there were two training colleges in my Country, both shared very little information about what they did but were keen for me to book an open day. Information about the wider practice was equally elusive (I’m a big fan of buying text books from amazon on subjects that interest me). </p>
<p>I’m open minded to alternative practice, and I think there is something to be said for improving circulation and organ function through improved posture and musculoskeletal function, but I’m not comfortable with working outside of evidence based practice, if nothing else, the liability is too high!

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wet objects aren't darker: they're <em>more transparent</em>.</p>
<p>Put a spot of water on a piece of paper and look down on it: the wet spot looks darker than the rest of the paper.  Now hold it up to the light: it looks brighter!</p>
<p>See /u/Flavored_Teeth 's answer: when light strikes a fibrous or granular surface like cloth, paper, or dirt, it bounces off the surfaces of all those fibers or grains, ping-pongs around a bit, and eventually much of the light bounces back out to your eyes.  As a result, these surfaces look light-colored.  But if you add water, you reduce the reflection off the fibers or grains (because the difference in index of refraction between the material and water is less than the material and air).  So the light penetrates deeper, is more likely to be absorbed or pass completely through rather than bouncing back out.</p>
<p>Most of the time when we look at things, both we and the light source are above the material, so dry things look brighter, wet things look darker.  But if the material is between us and the light source, it's the other way around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you look at a surface like sand, bricks, etc, the light you are seeing is reflected by diffuse reflection.</p>
<p>With a flat surface like a mirror, light falling on the surface is reflected back at the same angle it hit the surface (specular reflection) and you see a mirror image of the light falling on the surface. However a material like sand is basically lots of small grains of glass, and light is reflected at all the surfaces of the grains. The result is that the light falling on the sand gets reflected back in effectively random directions and the reflected light just looks white.</p>
<p>The reflection comes from the refractive index mismatch at the boundary between between air (n = 1.004) and sand (n ≈ ≈  1.54). Light is reflected from any refractive index change. So suppose you filled the spaces between the sand grains with a liquid of refractive index 1.54. If you did this there would no longer be a refractive index change when light crossed the boundary between the liquid and the sand, so no light would be reflected. The result would be that the sand/liquid would be transparent.</p>
<p>And this is the reason behind the darkening you see when you add water to sand. The refractive index of water (n = 1.33) is less than sand, so you still get some reflection. However the reflection from a water/sand boundary is a lot less than from an air/sand boundary because the refractive index change is less. The reason that sand gets darker when you add water to it is simply that there is a lot less light reflected.</p>
<p>The same applies to brick, cloth, etc. If you look at a lot of material close up you find they're actually transparent. For example cloth is made from cotton or man made fibres, and if you look at a single fibre under a microscope you'll find you can see through it. The reason the materials are opaque is purely down to reflection at the air/material boundaries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most ELI5 explanation I could make: It's reflecting the same amount of light, just not in the direction you're looking. Very rough opaque surfaces like cloth or cement reflect light uniformly in all directions. Water works like a lens, redirecting light towards some narrow directions back (reflection) and forward (refraction). </p>
<p>So when looking at a wet surface you could see all the light from a lightbulb only if you look at certain direction, but it'll be very bright. In the case of cloth or other absorbant materials the water fluid gets the same structure of the materials, and most of the light is bounced <em>through</em> the material towards whatever is under it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am not sure if this is allowed, but after reading the other answers, and great they are; it got me curious, so I Googled it and found <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2010/11/11/3063513.htm" target="_blank">this</a> amazing article. </p>
<p>I’ll paste it below. If this is against the rules I’ll remove it.</p>
<p>The speeds of light</p>
<p>We think of light as waves that travel in straight lines at a constant speed — 300,000 kilometres per second. But that's only true for light travelling in a vacuum, like empty space. Whenever light has to travel through anything with actual molecules floating around in it — like air, water or fabric — it slows down.</p>
<p>The slowing down happens because whenever light bumps into an atom or molecule, it gets absorbed and spat out on the other side. And all that absorbing and spitting takes a tiny fraction of time, so the light passes through any material more slowly than it would through empty space. Air doesn't have too many molecules to bump into, so it only slows light down a tiny bit (0.03 per cent). But water has way more molecules than the same volume of air, so light really has to work the room when it goes through the wet stuff — it's 25 per cent slower in water than it is in space.</p>
<p>And fabric is even more dense than water, so light slows down by a massive 33 per cent travelling through your t-shirt. The speed of light through a material compared to its speed in a vacuum is called its refractive index. The refractive index of empty space is 1, and air is 1.0003. Water has a refractive index of 1.33, and fabrics are all about 1.53.</p>
<p>But it's not the speed that light's travelling through water, fabric or air that makes wet things look darker — it's what happens when light changes speed that does the trick. And light changes speed whenever it moves from one refractive index to another. If a beam of light moves from air into fabric, it has to slow down from 300,000 kilometres per hour to 225,000 kilometres per hour instantly. And putting on the brakes like that makes light do the equivalent of an electromagnetic skid. It bends.</p>
<p>Light gets the bends</p>
<p>Why things look darker when wet The bigger the change in refractive index when light moves from one medium to another, the bigger the change in speed, and the bigger the angle that light bends at. So when light passes from air into fabric it bends at a much bigger angle than when it goes from water into fabric. And light doesn't just bend once when it goes from, say, air into fabric. Clothes are made up of fibres and air. Light passing through a t-shirt is going to constantly move in and out of the fibres and the air, and it bends every time it does. Because the refractive indexes of air and cotton are so different, the angle of the bend is pretty big. All those big angles mean that a lot of light ends up bouncing back out of the fabric — and some of it will head straight for your eyes. When your clothes are wet, all those air gaps get filled with water. So when light hits a wet patch it's moving in and out of water and fibres, not air and fibres. The refractive index of fabric is a lot closer to that of water than it is to air, so the light doesn't change speed quite as dramatically going between water and fibres. And that means it bends at a smaller angle when it goes from one to the other.</p>
<p>It's those small angles that are behind the darkness of the wet spot. With small angles, it takes a lot more bends for light to turn right around and head back out to our eyes, so more of the light ends up travelling forward into the fabric. And that patch looks darker.</p>
<p>Spend a few minutes under a hand dryer or sunshine, and you'll see the t-shirt lighten up again. As the water evaporates, air comes back into the water/fibre mix, and brings some bigger angles to the light, so more of it makes it back to our eyes. And we can face the world with crisp dry confidence again</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Water sitting above a surface, as in a puddle or lake, reflects light off it's surface. But water absorbed into something makes surfaces <em>less</em> reflective. Less reflection equals less light going toward you. Think of it like if a mirror were made out of cloth.
