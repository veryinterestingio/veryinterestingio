		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Civil engineer here. For old buildings, if they have the architectural plans then they can usually derive all the mathematical info they need and account for decayed members. If they don’t, they’ll try to generate one and usually schedule renovation. That’s mainly for old buildings like houses. Bridges can be tested for a variety of factors - they use a lot of deflection analysis, so like seeing how much a bridge will sag under a given load, or how much it’s cables (assuming suspension bridge) extend under that load. A lot of visual analysis occurs as well - cracks, rusty rebar, split timbers can all indicate the current state of the structure and can be accounted for in projections of how long it will last based on modeling. Other methods can also be used to look for wear <em>inside</em> a structure, like using electrical pulses or vibration feedback on concrete. Also, because building codes are so meticulous and regulated, a good inspector can actually refer to old building manuals and practically determine from those what kind of design life a structure was built for. It’s a fine-tuned skill and one of the aspects of civil engineering that is highly valued because of the experience it requires.</p>
<p>My timber design professor was such a knowledgeable guy that he was brought in to inspect why a frame holding a very expensive painting fell, and it didn’t even take him long to figure it out. </p>
<p>Honestly it’s pretty cool. Good question!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a Civil Engineer too from Brazil, let me just mention something.</p>
<p>It's very usual here to have old buildings which you haven't got the structural plans to, and you can't guarantee the original builder followed the codes of the time (they don't even follow it now.)</p>
<p>So one technique that's particularly interesting to test the strength of the concrete is that you can cut a cilinder out of a few columns (there are places in the column that you can do this safely) and test that cilinder's strength on a concrete press. This tells you how strong the concrete is, and you can close the hole with stronger concrete later.</p>
<p>This is called destructive testing, and there are many non-destructive methods available, but this is a fairly straightforward as many labs would have a concrete press.</p>
<p>Of course this doesn't cover the steel reinforcement, but as was already said that can be evaluated by other techniques.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

A lot of items are not recycled and are incinerated or sent directly to landfill because there are either unrecyclable items mixed in with the lots (like polystyrene) or they are simply too dirty. This is the case for a lot of plastic items.</p>
<p>It isn't economical for a recycler to accept a load of plastic that is covered with food waste, for example. Pizza boxes are not recyclable because they're soaked with grease.</p>
<p>Items which can be sold on are sold to middlemen who sell them to companies which process the material into usable material - usually by breaking them down at industrial scale. Those companies then sell the recycled material to manufacturers who process them into new products.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They mention explicitly at one point that the black hole is close to maximally rotating, which changes the stability of orbits. For a non-rotating black hole, you're right, the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) is 3 times the event horizon. The higher the spin of the black hole, though, the more space-time is dragged around with the spin, and you can get a bit of a boost by orbiting in the same direction as the spin. This frame-dragging effect lets you get a bit closer to the event horizon in a stable orbit. For a black hole with the maximum possible spin, ISCO goes right down to the event horizon. By studying the material falling into the black hole and carefully modelling the light it emits, it's even possible to back out an estimate of the black hole's spin, and this has been done for a number of black holes both in our galaxy and out. For those curious about the spin, ISCO, or black hole accretion geometry more generally, <a href="http://www.astro.umd.edu/~chris/Significant_publications_for_Christopher_Reynolds_files/Reynolds2013.pdf" target="_blank">Chris Reynolds has a review of spin measures of black holes</a> that's reasonably accessible (in that you can skip the math portions and still learn some things, particularly in the introduction). </p>
<p>They also mention at one point that the black hole is super-massive, which makes it physically quite large since the radius is proportional to mass. This has the effect of <em>weakening</em> the tidal forces at the point just outside the event horizon. While smaller black holes shred infalling things through their tides (called &quot;spaghettification&quot; since things are pulled into long strands - no really), larger black holes are actually safer for smaller objects to approach. Though things as big as stars still get disrupted and pulled apart, and we have actually seen that happen in other galaxies! </p>
<p>So for a black hole that's massive enough and has a high enough spin, it would be possible to have an in-tact planet in a stable orbit near the event horizon. Such a planet would not, however, be particularly hospitable to the continued existence of any would-be explorers, from radiation even if nothing else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former black hole physicist, but haven't had my coffee yet, so my numbers may be off...  </p>
<p>If you took the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way and dropped it where our sun is, the Earth would still orbit in the same place, but our &quot;year&quot; would only be about two hours. </p>
<p>That's <em>very</em> fast, and requires the earth to move 81,296 miles per second, or ~0.44 c.   No practical fusion rocket is going to achieve this, and certainly not one as small as the Endurance (the rotating ship in the movie).  Even an antimatter rocket using proton/antiprotons probably wouldn't be able to achieve this speed due to energy loss from neutral pions.</p>
<p>So while the planet itself may have been in a stable orbit, there's simply no way their ship could have caught up with it to land on it.</p>
<p>Edit:  I wanted to add some math here so I could double-check things (I'm writing a short story that coincidentally involves Sag A*, so it's killing two birds with one stone).</p>
<p>Start with Kepler's 3rd Law:</p>
<pre><code>T^2 / R^3 = (4*pi^2)*(G/M)</code></pre>
<p>Where T = the period of the orbit, R = radius of the orbit, M = mass of the central object, and G is the gravitational constant.</p>
<p>Let's assume you swap the sun for Sagittarius A* (the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way), while keeping the planets the same distance away.</p>
<p>You get (after cancelling out stuff):</p>
<pre><code>T_sun^2     M_sa
-------  =  ----
T_sa^2      M_sun</code></pre>
<p>Plugging in the mass of Sag A* (~4.1 million solar masses) and simplifying:</p>
<pre><code>T_sa = T_sun / 2024.84</code></pre>
<p>The period of Earth's orbit around the sun is 1 year (or 8,760 hours).   So if you swapped the Earth with the sun, the &quot;year&quot; would be:</p>
<pre><code>T_sa = 8,760 hours / 2024.84 ~= 4.3 hours</code></pre>
<p>So not &quot;2 hours&quot; as I stated above (I must have remembered wrong), but the story doesn't change too much.</p>
<p>The circumference of Earth's orbit is 942,000,000 kilometers.   To complete one orbit in 4.3 hours, the Earth has to be moving at 60,852 km/sec, or 0.2 c.</p>
<p>Which <em>may</em> be within the realm of possibility for a fusion engine, <em>if</em> it was &quot;straight line speed&quot;.  But the planet isn't orbiting in a straight line at 0.2 c, it's orbiting in a circle at 0.2 c, which is a much harder problem.</p>
<p>The ship basically has to back off a couple of light years (far enough to allow the fusion engine to reach a terminal speed of 0.2 c), accelerate in a straight line with the propellant it doesn't appear to have, and hope it arrives at the planet at <em>just</em> the right instant and at the right distance.   Otherwise, the ship is either going to miss the planet completely, or smash into it.</p>
<p>So it's still &quot;approximately impossible&quot; that the Endurance could ever land on the planet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This is mainly for performances reasons (offline renderers can take hours to render a single frame, while games have to spew them out in a fraction of a second).</p>
<p>Games use rasterization, while offline renderers use ray-tracing. Ray tracing is a lot slower, but can give more accurate results than rasterization^[1]. Ray tracing can be very hard to do well on the GPU because of the more restricted architecture, so most offline renderer default to the CPU. </p>
<p>GPUs usually have a better computing power/$ ratio than CPUs, so it can be advantageous to do computational expensive stuff on the GPU. Most modern renderers can be GPU accelerated for this reason. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do some start rendering in the center and go outwards (e.g. Cinebench, Blender) and others first make a crappy image and then refine it (vRay Benchmark)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cutting the image into square blocks and rendering them one after the other make it easier to schedule when each pixels should be rendered, while progressively refining an image allows the user to see what the final render will look like quickly. It's a tradeoff, some (most?) renderer offer the two options.</p>

<p>A lot of you are saying CPU render favors quality and GPU does quick but dirty output. This is wrong. Both a CPU and GPU are chips able to execute calculations at insane speeds. They are unaware of what they are calculating. They just calculate what the software asks them to.</p>
<p><strong>Quality is determined by the software.</strong> A 3D image is built up by a 3D mesh, shaders and light. The mesh (shape) of which the quality is mostly expressed in amount of polygons, where high poly count adds lots of shape detail but makes the shape a lot more complex to handle. A low poly rock shape can be anywhere from 500 to 2000 poly, meaning amount of little facets. A high poly rock can be as stupid as 2 to 20 million polygons.</p>
<p>You may know this mesh as wireframe.</p>
<p>Games will use the lowest amount of polygons per object mesh as possible to still make it look good. Offline renderer projects will favor high poly for the detail, adding time to calculate as a cost. </p>
<p>That 3D mesh is just a &quot;clay&quot; shape though. It needs to be colored and textures. Meet shaders. A shader is a set of instructions on how to display a 'surface'. The simplest shader is a color. Add to that, a behavior with light reflectance. Glossy? Matte? Transparant? Add those settings to calculate. We can fake a lot of things in a shader. A lot of things that seems geometry even. </p>
<p>We tell the shader to fake bumpiness and height in a surface (eg a brick wall) by giving it a bump map which it used to add fake depth in a surface. That way the mesh needs to be way less detailed. I can make a 4 point square look like a detailed wall with grit, shadows and height texture all with a good shader. </p>
<p>Example: <a href="http://www.xperialize.com/nidal/Polycount/Substance/Brickwall.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.xperialize.com/nidal/Polycount/Substance/Brickwall.jpg</a>
This is purely a shader with all texture maps. Plug these maps in a shader in the right channels and your 4-point plane can look like a detailed mesh all by virtue of shader faking the geometry.</p>
<p>Some shaders can even mimic light passing through like skin or candle wax. Subsurface scattering. Some shaders emit light like fire should. </p>
<p>The more complex the shader, the more time to calculate. In a renderend frame, every mesh needs it's own shader(s) or materials (configured shaders, reusable for a consistent look). </p>
<p>Let's just say games have a 60 fps target. Meaning 60 rendered images per second go to your screen. That means that every 60th of a second an image must be ready.</p>
<p>For a game, we really need to watch our polygon count per frame and have a polygon budget. Never use high poly meshes and don't go crazy with shaders.</p>
<p>The CPU calculates physics, networking, mesh points moving, shader data etc per frame. Why the CPU? Simple explanation is because we have been programming CPUs for a long time and we are good at it. The CPU has more on its plate but we know how to talk to it and our shaders are written in it's language.</p>
<p>A GPU is just as dumb as a CPU but it is more available if that makes sense. It is also built to do major grunt work as an image rasterizer. In games, we let the GPU do just that. Process the bulk data after the CPU and raster it to pixels. It's more difficult to talk to though, so we tend not to instruct it directly. But more and more, we are giving it traditionally CPU roles to offload, because we can talk to it better and better due to genius people.</p>
<p>Games use a technique called Direct Lighting. Where light is mostly faked and calculated as a flash. As a whole. Shadows and reflections can be baked into maps. It's a fast way for a game but looks less real. </p>
<p>Enter the third (mesh, shader, now light) aspect of rendering time. Games have to fake it. Because this is what takes the highest render time. The most accurate way we can simulate light rays onto shaded meshes is Ray tracing. This is a calculation of a light Ray travelling across the scene and hitting everything it can, just like real light.</p>
<p>Ray tracing is very intensive but it is vastly superior to DL. Offline rendering for realism is done with RT. In DirectX12, Microsoft has given games a way to use a basic form of Ray tracing. But it slams our current cpus and gpus because even this basic version is so heavy.</p>
<p>Things like Nvidia RTX use hardware dedicated to process Ray tracing, but it's baby steps. Without RTX cores though, RT is too heavy to do real time. But technically, RTX was made to process the DirectX raytracing and it is not required. It's just too heavy to enable for the older GPU's and it won't make sense.</p>
<p>And even offline renderers are benefiting from the RTX cores. Octane Renderer 2020 can render scenes up to 7X faster due to usage of the RTX cores. So that's really cool.</p>
<p>--- edit</p>
<p>Just to compare; here is a mesh model with Octane shader materials and offline raytracing rendering I did recently: <a href="https://i.redd.it/d1dulaucg4g41.png" target="_blank">https://i.redd.it/d1dulaucg4g41.png</a> (took just under an hour to render on my RTX 2080S)</p>
<p>And here is the same mesh model with game engine shaders in realtime non-RT rendering: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/zhrWPdu" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/a/zhrWPdu</a> (took 1/140th of a second to render)</p>
<p>Different techniques using the hardware differently for, well, a different purpose ;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of Ray Tracing renders like vRay or  Cycles  had options for GPU rendering for long time. Problem is that heavy scenes need large pools of memory something that wasn't available for GPUs until recent. If GPU can't load a scene into it's memory it simply can't render it at all which means despite CPU being slower it's still better because it can complete task,  CPU can have terabyte of RAM... however with more modern CUDA GPU can also use RAM in addition to VRAM for rendering.</p>
<p>Games heavily optimized to be used in real time renders with stable FPS and fit into GPU memory, while scenes in Blender or other 3d packages aren't and usually much more heavy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do some start rendering in the center and go outwards (e.g. Cinebench, Blender)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No real reason as example Blender have options for this, centre is good because that usually focus of the picture, why would you want to spend time rendering corner that might not show potential errors...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and others first make a crappy image and then refine it (vRay Benchmark)?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it does. However, the effect of the Sun on the tides is quite a bit weaker than that of the Moon. At first glance, this seems contradictory because the gravitational pull of the Sun is stronger than the one of the Moon.</p>
<p>But the tidal force isn't proportional to the gravitational force itself, but rather to the difference in gravitational force between the points  on Earth closest to and furthest from the other body. If you work out the numbers you'll find that because the Moon is so close to the Earth (compared to the Sun), this difference is larger for the Moon than it is for the Sun.</p>
<p>The tidal force of the Sun affects the regular cycle of the tides and depending on where the Sun and Moon are with respect to the Earth, tides may be stronger or weaker. When the Sun and Moon line up and their tidal forces work in conjunction, we speak of a &quot;spring tide&quot;.</p>
<p>edit: See <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/f1m5tm/if_the_moon_causes_high_and_low_tide_due_its/fh8slkw/" target="_blank">this comment</a> for the derivation of an approximation of the tidal force that demonstrates the tidal force scaling with the inverse of the cube of the distance, unlike the inverse square scaling of the gravitational force itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The numbers are binary. When you program with words, that interface converts the words to binary numbers for the actual computing.  </p>
<p>Those numbers direct EVERYTHING. for the image, they print one pixel on the screen at a time. The numbers tell it which positions to be in (pixel location on screen) along with what colour to be. </p>
<p>For the size of objects it’s easy to use math. Think 2x2 pixels for a small square image and 10x10 pixels for a large square. That’s all math, is which is what computers were made for.  </p>
<p>The computer has a processing speed, say 2 gigahertz. That means the processor processes 2,000,000,000 calculations per second.  </p>
<p>Imagine playing battleship with your friend. He tells you A1 is red. A2 is red. A3 is blue. A4 is red. A5 is blue. And so on. That is what is happening when the pixels are told what to do and how it knows which pixel should be what colour.  </p>
<p>Computers and game consoles need to “load” a level before you can start playing because even at 2,000,000,000 calculations per second it can still take a while to process all the variables.  </p>
<p>For a shoot ‘em up game, the computer uses more math for hitpoints. It knows you are at 88% health and just keeps subtracting as you get hit more. It knows that when the enemy’s health gets to zero that it needs to process another action (enemy dies).  It’s like when your doorbell rings you know to go answer it. </p>
<p>Computers do one thing at a time (mostly). So it’ll update every single pixel on the screen, and then adjust the hitpoints of all the players, then update all the pixels on the screen, then update all the hitpoints of the players.  And so on. It does that for every process, like looking for button presses or stick movement.   </p>
<p>Sometimes it may not even change anything. For example, it checks to see if you’ve been hit by another player.  If not, it does NOT subtract anything from your health. X button is STILL not being pressed? Then it continues to do nothing.  When you eventually press the X button then it will initiate the sequence of events that are to happen.  </p>
<p>Computers keep all the variables and screen colours separated by “addresses”, just like how your mail man only delivers your mail to you. You can think of your neighborhood like a screen made up of pixels. Each house is a pixel.  It’s one mail man but everyone gets their mail every single day.  It just takes time.  </p>
<p>Computers freeze when there is an error and it doesn’t know what to do. Imagine if you went to check your mail and there was an elephant in the mail box. You would have no clue how to deal with that.  </p>
<p>Remember, this is 2,000,000,000 calculations PER SECOND.  That is a lot of stuff to check and a lot of numbers to crunch.  </p>
<p>It’s really amazing but keep in mind the first calculator was the size of a house and all it did was add numbers.  What you are seeing is the culmination of decades of advancement in technology to make all this magic happen.</p>

<p>Organization.  Smaller things are organized into groups that have properties not present in any of the individual pieces.  Something that understands that organization can interpret it and extract information from them.  These groups themselves are organized into larger and larger groups, squiggles into letters, letters into words, words into sentences, until complex messages are being conveyed, messages completely divorced for their constituent parts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, one thing you can’t guess: a string of binary code just represents a plain old number.</p>
<p>For instance, 1011010 means 90. 101101010110101011010 means 1,486,170. I won’t explain here how one becomes the other because that’s a bit mathematically tedious, but just note that every number translates as a binary string, and every binary string translates as a number.</p>
<p>(Why 1s and 0s for computers? Because electronics works with electricity, electricity is either on or off, two states, 1 or 0.)</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Alright now that you know that, when you think about it, it’s outrageous the kinds of data you can represent with numbers.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Take a letter for instance.</p>
<p>“E” is the 5th letter of the alphabet; so if you decided to use that alphabet, the binary code representing 5 could mean “E”. Or you could use a different alphabet, one with all the lowercase and uppercase letters, and maybe it could have a ton of special characters and punctuations too. Oh, and optionally, it could contain Cyrillic characters so you can also write in Russian, French accents, etc.</p>
<p>If you can represent one letter with one number, then BAM! you can represent all the books in the world as a sequence of numbers.</p>
<p>Fun fact: bugs from using the wrong “alphabet” (encoding format) for a piece of data are among the WORST to figure out, as you can imagine. It would happen a ton decades ago, but thankfully are more rare now that most of the industry has ended rallying around one called “UTF-8”.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Take a color.</p>
<p>A rainbow goes from red to purple and meets all colors, so you can set a number for the distance from red for instance. A rainbow doesn’t get colors darker, so you can set another number for how dark. With those 2 numbers, I believe you can represent all colors you could ever need.
The way a computer typically does it though is not like that: it takes a value of how much red, of how much green, and of how much blue, and it mixes them up like paint. It’s less visually imaginable, but you can trust me that with those 3 numbers, you can also represent all colors you could ever need. This is called RGB (Red-Green-Blue, how original).</p>
<p>Say you have an image of 1000 pixels by 1000 pixels. So, that’s 1,000,000 pixels to represent. You can just spell each color of each pixel (that’s what the “bitmap” format does), and with 3,000,000 numbers, BAM! you’ve got your image.</p>
<p>Fun fact: there are ways that are much less resource-intensive to describe an image with numbers than by painstakingly spelling out the color of each pixel. I won’t get into how each works, but their names will be familiar: JPEG, GIF, PNG, ...</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Take a music note.</p>
<p>The height of the note really is its frequency, which is a number; and you can have another number for how strongly the note was played for instance, if it’s relevant to the instrument. Each instrument gives a certain frequency and strength (or several, if it’s an instrument that allows to play several notes at once), so combine together the right frequencies/strengths, from the right instruments at the same time, each note at the right time (which is also a number), and BAM! you’ve got a symphony.</p>
<p>That’s how digital music (like the MIDI format) works. Full disclosure: I have no idea how recorded sounds (Wave, MP3, ...) work, but you can take my word for it that it’s all also series of numbers.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Take a point on a sheet of paper on a table.</p>
<p>You can define the distance of that point from the top of the sheet (let’s call that value Y), and from the left side of the sheet (let’s call that value X), and you can represent any point on the sheet with those 2 numbers. Throw in a 3rd number for the altitude of the point (let’s call it Z) so it can be higher or lower than the table, and if you are willing to set every number even very high or very low for those 3 numbers X, Y, and Z, you can basically represent any point in the whole space around you.</p>
<p>Now, think of the shape of a soldier in a video game. That soldier is just a collection of dots at the exact right spot in space (each 3 numbers), those dots each have a certain color (also numbers), that soldier makes noise and speaks to you (sounds, which are also numbers), and you may see their name and health metrics above their head in plain text (also numbers).</p>
<p>You take a step towards the soldier: this just makes the first-person camera of the game change its values for X and Y in space, that’s still number stuff.</p>
<p>The soldier raises an arm, several parts of his body move separately their values of X, Y, and Z so they change position in space, in a way that together, it almost feels like a natural, human movement. Still numbers, all that.</p>
<p>And BAM! you got a video game. All with numbers. All represented with binary code.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a word: Interpretation.</p>
<p>The numbers that make up a computer program such as a video game, are either data or instructions.</p>
<p>Instructions are commands that the programmer is telling the CPU or some other component to process. The numbers map to a predefined set of instructions that the processor understands because of the way it was manufacturered, called the instruction set. Ever heard of x86 or x86-64 (aka x64)? Those are instruction sets for CPUs. They already define which number means Add, Subtract, Store, Retrieve, Compare etc. And with this basic machine code you can build software*. <em>Instructions are numbers that are interpreted by the processor to perform low level computations that make up the program.</em></p>
<p>Data is the content that will be used by the software. These numbers could represent colors, shapes, text, sounds, anything. How exactly a set of numbers can represent this content, depends on the type of content. Colours can essentially be represented by levels of Red, Green and Blue light, plus maybe Alpha (transparency); shapes can be coordinate points in a virtual space; text can be ASCII code points; sounds can be voltage levels representing sound pressure. It's the software's job (the instructions that the programmer writes) to specify what data represents what type of content, and what to ultimately do with it (decompress it, transform it, send it to the monitor, speakers, etc). <em>Data is numbers that represents a range of types of information and multimedia.</em></p>
<p>*Nowadays of course, programmers rarely write software in this low-level machine code, they use programming languages that abstract away these details</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wound healing releases a lot of histamine. Histamine causes the itch. There is evidence to suggest that antihistamines impair wound healing but for minor wounds it would not be significantly noticeable. Wound healing is a mixture of proliferation of epithelial cells, angiogenesis, fibroblast and myofibroblasts contracting to hold the wound together and inflammatory cells protecting the area from microbial insults as well as aiding with wound recovery. This complex interplay may cause itching.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The outer layer of our skin, epidermis (latin), is home to a lot of nerves. These nerves are really sensitive, so whenever we feel heat, a breeze, soft touch (a fly or whatever) the nerves are sending a signal to our brain that something is itching, especially when there is a wound. When the wound is in a healing proces the cells are dividing themselves and wander into the wound, where they reconnects and tries to heal up the wound.  </p>

Some fish do fart as other people in this thread have mentioned, but not all fish fart for the same reason. A curious, and very funny example is the Genius Corydoras. These fish are incredibly common in the Aquarium Hobby, and you have probably seen them at one time or another. Corys, as we like to call them tend to spend most of their time on the bottom, but occasionally will rush to the surface to gulp some air. This air is not used in respiration, but for digestion. A short while after gulping the air, they will pass it out.</p>

<p>Farts are caused by the digestion of food in the digestive tract by microorganisms. If there is food in the gut for any length of time, and the gut isn't sterile, there will be gas produced.</p>
<p>Now, it's possible that fish farts are absorbed into the feces. Maybe fish feces are wetter, and therefore better able to dissolve gases. Certainly it's not like diarrhea would be as big a problem for something that has a constant bidet current rolling past the anus... sp wetter fecal matter wouldn't necessarily promote disease.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several reasons. For one, people who break their hips tend to be quite elderly, and elderly people are at very high risk of dying for a lot of reasons. This is a correlation, not causation, as some people have pointed out.</p>
<p>But there ARE causational factors too. An elderly person who breaks their hip will often have to go into the hospital to get surgery or other kinds of treatment. Surgery is always risky and can cause infections and other complications, but especially in the elderly who have less well-functioning body systems in general. Prolonged hospital stays also increase the risk of infection by the nasty kind of bugs that tend to hang around in hospitals, like pneumonia, C difficile, or MRSA--and again, elderly people are more vulnerable.</p>
<p>Finally, being immobilized for along period of time (as <strong>[edit]</strong> CAN happen if you don’t get the right kind of recovery treatment) as well as the actual trauma of surgery puts you at huge risk of having blood clots that form in your legs, especially when you're elderly! These blood clots can then travel into your lungs and cause pulmonary embolisms. This is a HUGE cause of death in hospitals—it’s the most common reason why people die after surgery [Edit: I originally said it was 1/3 of all hospital deaths but that doesn’t seem to be correct. Apologies!]</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hip fractures are commonly associated with frequent falls. Falling a lot suggest a number of things - decreased strength, decreased balance, maybe decreased judgement, maybe impaired neurological function, remodeled bones from non-use, and overall poor function in general.  In a word: Frail.</p>
<p>After a major injury like a traumatic hip fracture, in order to recover there needs significant and concerted effort for rehab - which of course is a tall order in a person who is having falls to start. In memory patients, for instance, they can not remember enough to make any progress. Regardless, in that 6 weeks to a few months a lot more atrophy tends to set in. Function declines further. Bowels stop moving. Complications associated with immobility, UTI's, pneumonia, GI problems, problems from DVT prophylaxis (anticoagulation) are common.   There may not be a direct causation, but there are multiple inter-related issues along with initially poor function marking hip fracture as a frequent terminal event.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You have to break this into two groups. Low  energy hips fractures vs high energy hip fractures. Low energy hip fractures mean that the patient fell from a low height and broke their hip. That means their bones have failed. Just like any other organ system. You wouldn’t be surprised if you heard 50% of patients that presented with liver failure died.  </p>
<p>These patient have a high mortality rate. They are frail and their health is declining. In fact the only way to decrease said rate is operating and having them get up and walk as soon as possible. </p>
<p>High energy hip fractures happen in younger healthier patients and their mortality rate is based on other concomitant injuries. If they only have a hip fracture their mortality is quite low.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This correlation is part about what it says about your health if you break your hip and part about the consequences of a hip fracture.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
What having a hip fracture says about your health: there are two ingredients to a hip fracture, thin bones and a fall.  If you are missing either of these then you won't have a hip fracture.  Falls means you are frail - often less muscle mass, poorer nutrition and may have poor balance.  People with thin bones (osteoporosis or osteopenia) are also more likely to have multiple health issues causing this.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A hip fracture means a major surgery is needed which has a lot of potential complications: high risk of surgical complications, infection, blood clots, bedsores etc.  Given it's the frail people who have the fractures, they don't have much strength and are more likely to die from a complication. Elderly people have a significantly lower immune system.  For people who have major health issues such as heart or kidney problems the fracture and surgery can worsen these problems temporarily and not everyone it physically fit enough to get through that.<br />

Batteries work by electrons being stripped from a piece of metal with acid and pushed through a wire. When the metal is degraded too much, there’s no more electrons to strip off it and the battery no longer works. When you slap the remote the acid hits parts of the metal that may not have been soaking as much and shakes any potential lingering electrons off making them available to be pushed through the wire. Imagine you vacuum a dusty rug and it looks pretty good but then you pick it up and slap it and some dust debris still flies off. Same idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
