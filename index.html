		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The nukes themselves would be very unlikely to be noticed. The vast majority of the material put into the atmosphere by a detonation is going to be ordinary dirt and dust. Occasional atoms in that dust will have undergone nuclear transmutation into unusual materials, and the bomb components themselves could theoretically be detected, but we're talking about amounts as low as a few pounds distributed across hundreds of miles of atmosphere, and rapidly decreasing to boot.</p>
<p>One nuclear-age product, however, would have been an excellent sign of intelligent life - CFCs. Commonly used in refrigerators and responsible for the hole in the ozone layer, these chemicals can not be produced by any known natural process. Thousands of tons were released before they were banned, and it takes years for them to break down. Any aliens doing a spectrographic analysis on us at the time would have had a pretty good indication that there is intelligent life on Earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have questions about land cover types, the GLOBE Observer app, our current Land Cover Challenge, app development, or land science in general? We are here to answer your questions.</p>
<p>NASA GLOBE Observer is a smart phone app that lets you take citizen science data for NASA.  And just this month the GLOBE Observer team launched the latest tool within the app called: &quot;Land Cover Adopt a Pixel&quot;.  This new feature lets you take part in a project to create more detailed satellite-based global maps of land cover by sharing photos of the world around you.</p>
<p>Why does NASA need your help in collecting this data with the new GLOBE Observer Land Cover tool? One reason is to fill in details of the landscape that are too small for global land-mapping satellites to see. Land cover is critical to many different processes on Earth and contributes to a community's vulnerability to disasters like fire, floods or landslides. Read more at <a href="http://go.nasa.gov/2NdWgwt" target="_blank">go.nasa.gov/2NdWgwt</a>.</p>
<p>(And don't forget there is still time to take part in our Land Cover Challenge.  All participants will receive a virtual badge within the app if they make a Land Cover observation using the app between now and NASA's 60th anniversary (October 1st). However, the top 10 citizen scientists who map the most land in this period will be recognized on GLOBE Observer social media by a NASA scientist and will receive a certificate of appreciation from GLOBE Observer.)</p>
<p>Here answering your questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Peder Nelson - Land Scientist and the science lead for the Land Cover tool within the NASA GLOBE Observer app.</li>

Relatedly, I could imagine a scenario where some areas with a lower population density will not receive a lot of interest relatively. Of course, one could argue that these areas are also less interesting for many land cover data uses, but still, do you guys have a method in mind for dealing with this? And abroad? I'm currently looking into, among other things, remote sensing for disaster risk reduction in developing countries and the availability of high resolution data is often a problem; these kind of projects could really help, but at the same time of course in many developing countries such a project is also much harder to pull off...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm consolidating a couple of points others have made:</p>
<p>1) the anchor isn't always needed to keep a large ship in place. The chain is so large that the weight of the chain, when stretched out across the water between the the ship's hawse pipe (the opening on the bow the anchor chain passes through to the water) and the anchor creates a heavy center of mass between those two points for gravity to work on it. Even on a smooth hard bottom the force of gravity pulls that chain down and quite literally pins down the ship in most conditions. A section of chain near the anchor actually does rest flat on the floor of the ocean when this happens. <em>edit</em></p>
<p>2) If an anchor properly digs into a muddy or sandy bottom, it did so by a horizontal tension. This is created by letting out more anchor chain than would be needed to drop the anchor straight down beneath the ship, and doing so is standard procedure even though getting the anchor to &quot;dig&quot; isn't always necessary as explained above. When ready to weigh anchor, the ship's crew starts winding up the anchor, slowly pulling the ship towards the spot where the anchor rests directly below it again. Once the chain tends vertically again, the anchor will literally have tilted back to vertical as well, essentially digging itself back out. Think of the way a fish hook might be taken out of something by turning it to a different angle. Then the anchor can be pulled all the way up. </p>
<p>Rocky bottoms are generally avoided if possible to avoid doing damage to reefs and to avoid lodging an expensive anchor into a rock and not being able to retrieve it.
Additionally, large ships never anchor in water deeper than their anchor chain allows them; it's much easier to just drift if you must stop actively moving around and the water is too deep for anchoring. </p>
<p>Edit: previously misstated that <em>no</em> anchor chain rests in the bottom; this is false, generally there is a section of chain that sits on the seabed with the anchor. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m going to skip sea anchors/drogues altogether, which are used to keep vessels pointing into weather while at sea. </p>
<p>For smaller vessels:</p>
<p>When you drop an anchor and its rode (chain/rope/cable or combinations of them), it’ll hit the bottom and settle. You want to let out enough, so as the vessel is pulled back, the angle of the rode vs the bottom is small enough that the forces are as horizontal as possible, so the anchor digs into the seabed. </p>
<p>When the rode is chain, it will help keep this angle, because it’s heavy and it wants to lay on the bottom.  This will keep the anchor dug in as much as possible, but heavy weather can cause the anchor to drag along the bottom, so you’re basically plowing the seabed. </p>
<p>For weighing anchor, as you pick up the rode you are increasing the angle of the rode to the point to where it’s pretty much vertical to the seabed. Pulling further will break the drag between the bottom and the anchor, and voilà... anchor’s loose. Note: try not to snag your anchor on rock, etc. You might have to dive for it. </p>
<p>For larger vessels:</p>
<p>Process is the same, but anchors on large (read tankers, container ships, Navy, etc.) ships are extremely heavy, and the anchor MIGHT NOT dig in, even if designed to. Basically the vessel in this case will be held in place by a heavy hunk of iron laying on the bottom, and the forces of the vessel pulling on the combo of anchor/chain aren’t enough to move the anchor, so the vessel stays in place. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Speaking of small boat experience. </p>
<p>Chain is not to weigh the boat down from moving. An anchor needs to lay flat on the bottom. Most anchors are shaped like a hoe for plowing. The more you pull on it , horizontally, the more the anchor goes into the ground. Making it harder and harder to move. If you don’t use chain then the rope will float and begin pulling up the anchor.</p>
<p>I have no idea how big anchors on cruise ships work. As their shape is completely different than inland anchors. </p>
<p>Also. There are different anchors for each application.
Rock - uses kinda like a grappling hook looking thing that has bendy hooks. That way when it hooks a rock, they can still release it.
Mud/sand - several different styles. The hoe I was talking about. There’s also a bell looking one.
Poles - some people will just shove a pole in the ground and tie a loop to it. Obviously shallow water. </p>
<p>Source - I’ve been boating longer than I could drive a car. Family owned a marina growing up. Been around more boats than most sailors. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As nuclear Cadillacs said.... I would add that the vitreous jelly that constitutes the largest part of the eye (from a volume standpoint) embryologically was a vascular structure. That allowed the eye to develop in utero when it's metabolic demands were higher and all parts of the eye needed more blood flow. But in order to have a clear medium for light to travel through, those vessels regress, leaving a virtually clear cavity through which light can travel. There are disease states associated with failure of this process (eg persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous).      </p>
<p>One other interesting fact is that despite having some avascular parts, there are other parts of the eye with incredibly high blood flow. The choroid which supports the outer third of the retina has the highest blood flow density of any tissue in the body as well as the highest oxygen tension.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The physical reason animals sleep with their eyes closed is moisture. Just have a good old staring contest with someone and you will see after only a few minutes your eyes will start to dry out and the urge to blink really kicks in. Now imagine leaving them open for hours straight. As for sleeping with your eyes open, there are risks. If your eyes become too dry &quot;dry spots&quot; can form on the cornea, causing inflammation and over time could lead to a number of eye problems. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think people have pretty well covered the second question, but the short answer to OP's first question is sensory input. Sleep is easiest to achieve(especially when not overly tired) when we have limited sensory stimulation. We process a disproportionate amount of our sensory input visually, so closing our eyes is the easiest way to shut that down and let our brain start to rest. The same reason we don't want to be tickled as we fall asleep, or have a loud environment, or a room that is very hot or cold to fall asleep in. Those all stimulate your senses, which, in turn, keeps you up. If you're a (mostly) normal person, that is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't my specific area of research so I might be missing some key findings, but the answer seems to be yes, both behaviorally and neurally, although we also have many of the same processing advantages for very familiar faces (see discussion of this at the end of the post):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We're faster at recognizing our own faces compared to either familiar faces (of friends) or unfamiliar faces, even when they are inverted, whereas inverted familiar and unfamiliar faces are equally difficult to recognize (<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17470211003611264?casa_token=pJekisSAb_YAAAAA:aXYwUZE-tUBbluC1ysrgafqHJ6RcWFYXi2jz2ywmEkoYeU03xIwS5kVAwfuVJT2Y3QCsM7L0OZASw4I" target="_blank">Keyes &amp; Brady, 2010</a> &lt;- pdf!).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We process highly familiar faces (including our own) more rapidly than those of strangers as measured by response time in a visual search task where you are shown a number of face images and have to say whether a target face is present or not (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Frank_Tong3/publication/12834940_Robust_representations_for_faces_Evidence_from_visual_search/links/53cfe1420cf2f7e53cf839ca/Robust-representations-for-faces-Evidence-from-visual-search.pdf" target="_blank">Tong &amp; Nakayama, 1999</a> &lt;- pdf!). Although more recent work (<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.147.9671&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank">Devue et al., 2009</a> &lt;- pdf!) suggests that familiar faces hold attention longer once they are already focused on and make it harder to disengage during a search task so you spend more time looking at them, rather than the effect being due to enhanced processing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seeing your own face captures your attention while doing another task, but not more so than seeing other, highly familiar faces (<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/42275913/u190843274Devue_Bredart_2008.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1538152206&amp;Signature=cmynWm4ANfg2G8DlYl3LIVRHxOY%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DAttention_to_self-referential_stimuli_Ca.pdf" target="_blank">Devue &amp; Bredart, 2008</a> &lt;- pdf!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We're faster at recognizing frontal pictures of our own face rather than profile pictures. There is no difference in reaction time for unfamiliar faces. This suggests that familiarity with seeing our face from a specific viewpoint affects face processing / representation (<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/713754410?casa_token=vA9QBrEN8KkAAAAA:n8PyrqIWxqEiG9a6Rp4aSWYWxupKDm8aWtIA4CaVBn-xaR4B2c9zP65P8cbHplV7sB-95ozEVEmtQwA" target="_blank">Laeng &amp; Rouw, 2001</a> &lt;- pdf! ; <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1068/p2901?casa_token=_67fGuo_hk8AAAAA:BRaWRdpdl_MvUnO1xgAB-VVoQ8J-X6iEeJ2nvujVkAJCu_vvFFfKEI95LQlpLJ7_ZPw6u1mBJAUoOHU" target="_blank">Troje &amp; Kersten, 1999</a> &lt;- pdf!). This is supported by the fact that we think mirrored pictures of ourselves are more representative than non-mirrored, while the opposite is true for pictures of our friends (<a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03197695.pdf" target="_blank">Rhodes, 1986</a> &lt;- pdf!), although it might be the case that we use slightly different cues (e.g. asymmetrical features like moles or hairstyles) for our own faces vs. those of our friends since we sometimes see pictures of ourselves (non-mirror-reversed), but we almost never see mirror-reversed pictures of our friends (<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1068/p3354?casa_token=npBN_FHwNlgAAAAA:NnFQTU8j0RS6Rr1DSBFHyqyfVM5VFWMUEAOaTYo--06y3Zijgl2L4kiJd0EWGOZY3PFit9FXUIWNe-o" target="_blank">Bredart, 2003</a> &lt;- pdf!). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some studies have found unique patterns of brain activation to one's own face vs. both familiar and unfamiliar faces (<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4083/3f3e65ed7a910351ddf1c4cded5fb2d4e6d6.pdf" target="_blank">Keenan et al., 2000</a> &lt;- pdf!; <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278262609001778" target="_blank">Keyes et al. 2010</a> ; <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/43911052/Recognizing_ones_own_face20160320-14736-ipatxt.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1538152568&amp;Signature=D6Mf5DrOLQVgNoLuOn12oOHxYew%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DRecognizing_ones_own_face.pdf" target="_blank">Kircher et al., 2001</a> &lt;- pdf! ; <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1d13/83a6bea09deddfd5a173c829cc607d9a621a.pdf" target="_blank">Platek et al., 2006</a> &lt;- pdf! , <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006899308016648" target="_blank">2008</a> ; <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393208005095" target="_blank">Platek &amp; Kemp, 2009</a> ; <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.659.5844&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank">Uddin et al., 2005</a> &lt;- pdf!), particularly in right frontoparietal areas, possibly connected to mirror neuron system (for reviews, see <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/828a/b00c644ea7f2164b385b6a705567da20891b.pdf" target="_blank">Uddin et al., 2007</a> &lt;- pdf! and <a href="https://orbi.uliege.be/bitstream/2268/85119/1/DevueBredartC%26Cpostprint.pdf" target="_blank">Devue &amp; Bredart, 2011</a> &lt;- pdf!). These areas seem to be specific to self-face recognition, as opposed to being generally related to self-identity (e.g., recognizing one's name) (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811908003029" target="_blank">Sugiura et al., 2008</a> ; <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811910000509" target="_blank">Miyakoshi et al. 2010</a>). </p>
</li>
<li>The right-hemisphere preference is supported by some behavioral work that found that we're faster at responding to our own face when making responses with the left hand (controlled by right hemisphere) rather than the right (Keenan et al., <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393299000251" target="_blank">1999</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393299001451" target="_blank">2000</a>). Furthermore, modulating cortical activity in areas in the right, but not the left hemisphere using rTMS impairs self-face recognition (<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.665.2609&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank">Heinisch et al., 2010</a> &lt;- pdf! ; <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lucina_Uddin/publication/6420954_RTMS_to_the_right_inferior_parietal_lobule_disrupts_self-other_discrimination/links/00b7d5215b6285dbd9000000.pdf" target="_blank">Uddin et al., 2006</a> &lt;- pdf!). However, responses to other familiar faces show a bias for a different visual field than those for self-faces (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393204000454" target="_blank">Brady, Campbell, &amp; Flaherty, 2004</a>), suggesting that perhaps familiar and self-faces are represented separately.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the studies linked above suggest that whether the effects are specific to our own face vs. face stimuli to which we've been exposed to many times seems to vary depending on task. Note that this is a little tricky to tease apart when looking at patterns of neural activity: you can compare activity to many different instances of familiar faces vs. unfamiliar faces and show a difference between average response to one vs. another. That would indicate that the difference is not likely due to any one particular face, but is a categorical distinction that we make. That's been found in plenty of studies (see below). It's trickier to do a comparison between one's own face and other faces. If you just have one image of your face, then the difference in response might be due to that particular image, as opposed to a categorical distinction. Even if you have many images of one's own face taken at different times and from different angles, they are still going to be more similar to each other than images of familiar faces of different people, so it wouldn't be surprising if you found a difference in activity. I'm not sure what the best way of doing such an experiment would be. I haven't read all of the papers too closely, so perhaps they control for such things in a way I haven't thought of. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I strongly suspect that there are a number of ways we can do this, other than simply ramping up the Teslas. Because while a strong field could protect us well, it would also play havoc with anything inside the spacecraft, such as computers and anything metallic that isn’t bolted down. And powering something strong also brings with it its own set of engineering issues.</p>
<p>And a pretty prescient subject, considering all the chatter there is about going to Mars these days.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Earths the magnetic field is pretty weak, about .3 Gauss, it is only able to protect us from energetic charged particles because it is so vast - it needs to act over extremely long distances to deflect particles by small angle changes. I haven't done the math but if it scales linearly you'd need about 10^6 times more field to act over the small scale lengths of a vessel. This puts us around the 100 Tesla range and you'd need the field to extend somewhere on the order of a meter. This is about the same as the 2012 record set by the national high magnetic field laboratory. Given that I suppose its possible to generate such fields with current technology but a space application would have to be at least decades off. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best solution is not to use a magnetic field, but an electric one. We can generate these fields at a much higher strength with less power and they have no effect on humans (unlike magnetic fields which long term exposure results in some weird and possibly hazardous effects). Furthermore, electric fields do not need poles and you can face them in any direction. If you were to face one out it would slow down any particles approaching the spacecraft.</p>
<p>We would only place these at key points such as the windows to living areas etc, and use clever design such as location of onboard water to provide some passive protection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the history of the polygraph (lie detector) and its legal status is a very interesting one. In 1923, the US Supreme Court ruled that they were <em>not</em> admissible evidence in court, because the consensus among scientific experts was that they could not prove whether someone was lying or not. For 70 years this standard of scientific evidence (&quot;do other scientists think it is science?&quot;) was the legal standard of the US (called the Frye standard, from the polygraph case). In the 1990s it was superseded by different guidelines (the Daubert standard, which is very different).</p>
<p>My understanding is that while you could not introduce polygraph evidence as a piece of damning evidence, it was ruled that you could introduce it as possible exculpatory evidence: because it was assumed that it would be easy for it to give a false positive (and say someone was lying when they were not), if you took a test and it showed you were not lying, and this somehow helped the defendant, then it was admissible. </p>
<p>Today the process is a little more complicated: judges can determine whether polygraph evidence is admitted (which is in line with the Daubert approach, which puts a lot more power in the hands of the judges to decide what is and what is not scientific evidence), but in general the legal system is pretty skeptical of the idea of convicting someone on the basis of a polygraph examination. </p>
<p>What's <em>really</em> interesting though is that the primary use of the polygraph in the US is <em>not</em> in courts at all. As a form of evidence, it is pretty suspect. But as a ritual that scares people into confessing (sometimes, it is feared, falsely), it is <em>very</em> effective. Hook people up to a science machine and say that it tells you whether they are lying or not, and people start sweating and telling you things. The most famous example of this comes from lore about police officers who hooked a suspect up to a Xerox machine and photocopied a piece of paper that said &quot;LIE&quot; on it whenever they wanted to tell the suspect they didn't believe him, and the suspect confessed after this. </p>
<p>So the <em>value</em> of a polygraph is less that it actually gives scientific or legally binding evidence of truth-telling or lying, but that it has psychological power over people. And this has, apparently, been very successful at getting them to tell the truth. </p>
<p>The actual scientific &quot;status&quot; of the polygraph is very much in debate; some say it can be used effectively, some say it is total pseudo-science. The question hinges not on whether it gives information that is sometimes true but how reliable it is: it is worth someone going to prison (or losing their job, or whatever) if there is some chance of it being totally incorrect? Even if it was right 90% of the time, there would still be a large number of people who failed it unjustly.</p>
<p>But again, for the purpose of getting confession, that doesn't seem to matter much — if people think, even subconsciously, that it works, then it turns into a useful tool, even if it doesn't produce admissible or powerful evidence for court on its own terms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The results of a lie detector (ABC is lying) is not admissible as evidence.</p>
<p>The statements made by the person taking the test (I like hats) can be admissible.</p>
<p>Lie detector tests are not used to generate evidence in the form of knowing whether someone was lying. Lie detector tests are used as a tool to generate confessions.</p>
<p>Here's an example. Bob is accused to killing Tom. The investigator has Bob take a lie detector test. The investigator tells Bob that he failed the lie detector test, and that he's going to go to prison unless he cooperates. If he confesses, the investigator will make sure that they go easy on him. Bob confesses to killing Tom.</p>
<p>The fact that Bob took the test is usually not admissible. The results of the test are not admissible (nor did they matter in the example; even if he had passed, the investigator would have said he failed to get the confession). The confession that follows <strong>is</strong> admissible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
