		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the most part, we use pseudo random number generators, which work by doing a math formula on a seed number. Most commonly, the seed is all or part of the system clock time, but in most implementations you can also provide a seed if you want. </p>
<p>An interesting side effect of this is if you provide the same seed, you'll get the same results. There are times that's desirable, but usually you just let the system use its default method of obtaining a seed.</p>
<p>True random number generators are hardware solutions that use a physical phenomenon like thermal noise, photoelectric noise, etc to generate randomness. Generally this is considered unnecessary except in high end cryptography.</p>
<p>Edit: as pointed out several times below, a &quot;true random number generator&quot; is still not truly random, but it's more difficult to figure out what the seed would be.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All PRNGs (pseudo random number generators) have the following three characteristics:</p>
<ol>
<li>An internal state.</li>
<li>An update function to update the internal state.</li>
<li>An output function to convert the internal state into a useful value.</li>
</ol>
<p>And step 0, which is a way to seed the internal state when it's instantiated.</p>
<p>Consider the linear congruential generator, (LCG) which is one of the simplest random number generators:</p>
<ol>
<li>The internal state is an unsigned integer x. The seed is just a number to assign to x.</li>
<li>The update function is <code>x = (A*x + B) % M</code> for some fixed integers A, B, and M. M is commonly a power of two because that makes the modulo operation really easy.</li>
<li>The output function is the identity function; if x is 12, the output function returns 12.</li>
</ol>
<p>For A=17, B=11 and M=31, seed=0, an LCG will return the following list of numbers: 0 11 12 29 8 23 30 25 2 14 1 28 22 13 15 18 7 6 20 10 26 19 24 16 4 17 21 27 5 3. (which then repeats) Which looks pretty random, and in many cases will work just fine.</p>
<p>For a PRNG (pseudo random number generator) to also be a CSPRNG (cryptographically secure PRNG) you also need the following things to be true:</p>
<ol>
<li>The seed and internal state must be large enough that they can't be brute forced. In a LCG, the internal state is just 32 or 64 bits; I can, on my laptop, generate all possible states and compare them to the random effects I can observe. Because the state is so small, the LCG cannot be cryptographically secure.</li>
<li>The output function must be a one-way function. That is, if I see outputs from the RNG, I can't use those to derive what the internal state must be. For instance, the LCG gives away the keys to the kingdom in its output function, so it can't be cryptographically secure.</li>
<li>It must be seeded securely. It's common practice in, for instance, video games to seed an RNG to whatever the system time is. As a simple example, if right now is 2019-07-14 at 7:12pm, you might seed the RNG to 20190714712. (computers typically store date/times as seconds since some certain defined date, but you get the idea) This won't be secure, because everybody knows what time it is. And even if you have a clock that measures in microseconds, you can guess the server time to the nearest minute and then brute force the remaining ~26 bits of the seed. More on this in a bit.</li>
<li>Ideally, the update function ought to be a one-way function as well. But this isn't strictly necessary.</li>
</ol>
<p>Getting a secure seed can be surprisingly difficult. In general, you need to make measurements where the precision of the measurement is in excess of the accuracy of the measurement. If the precision of your measurement is 4 bits in excess of the accuracy of the measurement, you basically gain 4 bits of entropy. You need to repeat this process until you have enough entropy, then you need to &quot;squish&quot; the raw data down to the size of the seed in a way that preserves entropy.</p>
<p>A common source of such measurements is I/O devices. For instance, if your monitor resolution is 1920x1080, you have about 11 bits x 10 bits of precision, but the fleshbag connected to your mouse only has about 8x7 bits of accuracy. So moving the mouse around and capturing the mouse position of each frame will generate ~6 bits of entropy per frame. Timing is another common source. You can query the CPU for what clock cycle it's on, which is precise to about 250 picoseconds. I/O devices will periodically send interrupts, and you can store the clock cycle as a measurement- the most precise 2-3 bits are basically pure noise. Data collection devices are great as well. Take a picture of a white piece of paper with your cell phone's camera. Zoom in on it. See how the paper is covered with slightly off colored pixels? That's pure entropy-filled gold. Even though a camera will generate 24 bits of information per pixel, you can safely assume that the least significant digits is random noise. So a picture from a 10 megapixel camera will have roughly 10,000,000 random bits, even if an attacker is able to capture a similar frame. (note: if the image is saturated, you get 0 random bits. So test for that first.)</p>
<p>So now you have all these measurements, where each measurement contributes 1-3 bits of &quot;real&quot; randomness, but 97% of the bits of each measurement will be known to a sophisticated attacker. Now what? Well, you take the whole pile of those measurements and apply a cryptographic hash to them. Say SHA-512. This way, if your measurements totaled to ~400 bits of &quot;real&quot; randomness, your SHA-512 hash will also have ~400 bits of randomness, even if an attacker is able to accurately predict the other 99,600 bits in your measurements.</p>
<p>If your update function is one way, it's even easier. You start with an initial state of all zeroes, xor a measurement into your state, apply the update function, repeat for each measurement. If your update function is up to snuff, you won't &quot;lose&quot; any randomness along the way. This is also super helpful for an OS level CSPRNG, because you can continuously improve your state as time progresses.</p>
<p>Some classes of devices genuinely don't have good sources of randomness, particularly embedded devices. Insufficient randomness is a common vulnerability among IoT (internet of things) devices.</p>
<p>There's also hardware random number generators. That's another topic for another time though, because this isn't simulating randomness, this <em>is</em> randomness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister#Algorithmic_detail" target="_blank">It's really complicated</a>, even for people with a decent understanding of math. To simplify, but hopefully not corrupt the message, the idea is that algorithmic randomness depends on so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator" target="_blank"><em>pseudo</em>random number generation</a>; numbers are selected from a deterministic sequence designed to emulate true randomness. Different invocations of the algorithm return different numbers by selecting a different seed, i.e., a different initial value.</p>
<p><em>Edit</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a deterministic sequence designed to emulate true randomness</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To expand on this slightly, I suppose, imagine you had a sequence like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1, 1, 1, 1...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is &quot;obviously&quot; not random. Also obviously not random would be a sequence like the natural numbers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1, 2, 3, 4, 5...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you tried to generate a random sequence <em>ad hoc</em>, you might just pick some numbers, say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1, 423523, 1123, 340, 142, 120483...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But even this selection isn't guaranteed to be &quot;as random&quot; as a truly random sequence. Algorithmically-generated pseudorandom sequences are sequences designed to have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution" target="_blank">probability distributions</a> (i.e., the likelihood of each value in the sequence appearing) that more closely resemble &quot;true&quot; random sequences.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yeah for most purposes, using your computers clock to generate a random number is good enough. It's always ticking forward, measured from 1/1/1970, so it works pretty well. </p>
<p>I just wanted to add in how some companies get around a computers inability to create a truly random number/sequence. They get a wall of something like lava lamps, and then a camera is trained on it. They will have written some kind of program that will generate a character or whatever output they need, depending on what the lava lamp looks like from the cameras view, and can generate truly random sequences. </p>
<p>It's a really cool low tech/high tech solution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many different techniques, depending on the software used. But almost all boil down to one idea: you provide a so-called seed, which is some piece of data that has some sort of randomness to it. This can vary a lot, depending on your hardware platform, operating system, or even the programming language that is used. There is then some sort of algorithm, basically a mathematical formula, which uses this seed as its inputs and produces a seemingly random number as the output. Basically, you have some formule like f(x)=<em><some formula here></em>, with x being your seed, and the formula being some bit of math that can have widely variable outputs, even if x changes only a little. The exact form of this formula can also vary a lot, depending on hardware used, operating system, and programming language.</p>
<p>There are various tactics for obtaining such a seed. Some user software may use random input factors. For example, user input like keystrokes (or the timing thereof) or mouse movements. Data from this is then fed into the randomiser algorithm. Your phone may use data from the accelerometer or other sensors to do this. There are also companies that provide their own cryptography services and have built their own randomisers. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cUUfMeOijg" target="_blank">Cloudfare continuously films lava lamps</a>, and produces random numbers based on those. Other software purely depends on whatever randomness is present in the computer's hardware. I believe the real time clock is often used, which is then put in the randomiser algorithm, but this is not a very good method and should only be used for software that doesn't need a high level of security.</p>
<p>Basically, there are all sorts of tactics. It really depends on the hardware of the specific computer, the algorithm used , the operating system, the programming language, and even then there may be a special piece of engineering for systems that need some extra security.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They can track them by touch and by smell.</p>
<p>Basically how it works is each of your B lymphocytes (the white blood cells that chase down bacteria) gets randomly assigned one specific antigen (a cell part visible from the outside of the cell) to look out for for and then gets released into your blood to float aimlessly around gloming onto cells and seeing if they match that antigen. (This is also how they know which things are invaders and which aren't: the cells are 'trained' in your bone marrow by basically exposing them to your own cells and killing any of the ones that exhibit an immune response - these ones are defective and would attack your own body, so they get weeded out before they're released into the bloodstream.)</p>
<p>If they ever find a match, that B lymphocyte starts releasing a variety of chemicals into your blood: antibodies (which latch onto the antigens it found and makes the bacteria sticky and visible), and cytokine (which are signalling chemicals which your other white blood cells can 'smell' and follow to the site of the infection, based on the concentration gradient of that particular cytokine). It also starts rapidly dividing and reproducing into a host of B lymphocytes that all match that one antigen, many of which undergo a different developmental pathway (which is based on the presence of those cytokines) to specialize them for different roles in the immunological response.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Say you get bacteria in a cut in your skin. You have white cells constantly monitoring your body via your blood stream. These cells have proteins on their surface that make them “sticky” so instead of flowing through the blood like a red blood cell would, they “roll” along the surface of your vessels more slowly. When bacteria get in your skin (just an example) a cascade of events happens. Local white blood cells that live in the skin (we don’t need to talk about the specifics here) find the bacteria and send out signals called cytokines. There are a ton of different cytokines, but we’ll just talk about two functions of them for now. They do two things: firstly they go to the closest blood vessel and tell it to switch it’s “rolling” molecules to “come on in” molecules. Now the white cells that were rolling along in the blood steam come across this vessel and stick to it and leave the circulation and enter the tissue close to the site of infection. In addition to the “come on in” signal, the first on scene skin white blood cells are also secreting “over here” molecules. So the white blood cell in the blood steam left the circulation due to one cytokine, and found the bacteria via another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Yes, someone, or, instead, some group of people, made them out of the blue. People aren't born with language &quot;pre-installed&quot; or something like that, it has to come from somewhere. Here's the deal, we still aren't sure when it began. The more we dig, the more our understanding of language increases, leading us to look in some places we hadn't thought before.</p>
<p>For example, we're now noticing that apes closely related to humans, like chimps, bonobos, gorillas, orangutans, and such, have some sort of proto-language. They have calls, grunts, shouts, hums, and more that, in a way, count as a form of language, but it doesn't have all the rules and conventions that a &quot;formal&quot; language has. Our current understanding of languages isn't enough to say &quot;languages begin here&quot;, so we can't say for sure -at the moment- what's the last common language ancestor, but that won't stop of from digging more and learning more about them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a linguist but hopefully I can add something to the conversation. Like many others have said, modern languages &quot;evolved&quot; from old extinct languages. If you keep going back, there should be a certain point in time where things are invented. I guess the moment they became existant, if they are useful, that concept will continue to be used by future generations. For example, let's look at the word &quot;google&quot;. It was not used until Google, the search engine was invented and became dominant, but now that it has, it's sort of become a verb and maybe in the future, it will evolve into a concept like an entity holding limitless information. And if enough people find the concept useful and keep expanded upon it, I guess it can become a root for future languages, like Martian English or whatever.</p>
<p>Just pure speculations here, but we have seen countless examples like this in modern languages so it makes sense for me. I hope it somewhat helps you imagine the path languages can take.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Optometrist here: Seems well covered already but it is due to the “bleaching” of retinal photoreceptors in any particular area.  Each photo receptor has a stack of membrane disks which are covered in photopigments of different types called Rhodopsins.  Each time a Rhodopsin molecule absorbs light it “flips” causing an electrical impulse down the membrane by way of a cascade it sends the signal down the rod/cone to a complicated chain of cells and cell processing which becomes quickly less relevant to this conversation.  The disks are slowly “consumed” and moved Down the rod/cone until it can be shed and absorbed by the retinal pigment epithelium layer for reabsorption.  When an area is bleached relative to another area the signal becomes muted as the cells regenerate (can take up to 5 seconds for most people longer if problems exist).  The after image can last longer if a very intense stimulus (like a bright light) were to bleach the area.  Sufficiently intense lights such as the sun simply burn a hole through the nerves causing permanent damage which you can not recover from.  We refer to this as “solar retinopathy”.  I have also seen cases where laser pointers have caused retinal burns.</p>

<p>Translating the images your eye sees into something your brain can interpret involves each photoreceptors checking to see if it's chemicals have been degraded, not directly checking to see if you are actively looking at an object. Therefore, an afterimage can stick around even once you look away or close your eyes. The term 'burn' used in reference to afterimages is completely different than the regular definition of a burn.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lotta comments here explaining why we see an afterimage when we close our eyes - as for why the &quot;outline&quot; might appear brighter than the rest of the object, this is because our eyes are actually able to accentuate lines and edges within our field of vision. This is because the information sent by any particular location on the retina actually results from a patch of sensory cells, containing both light-excitable and light-inhibitable cells. They are arranged such that an area of contrasting brightness (e.g. an edge or a line causes by a real life object) will result in a higher signal intensity, meaning that the edges of an object appear brighter to us than the area within it's borders.
This is quite useful since lines and edges are important features for helping us discern what's in our field of vision, where objects stop and start, more important than say, the middle of where an object is. Looking at power lines is good for observing what I'm talking about. Not only does this give a longer-lasting after image to the borders of objects, but the after image is often observable even without closing your eyes by just move your eyes elsewhere.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An allergic reaction is when your immune system overreacts to something foreign.</p>
<p>For things like bacteria or viruses, we can develop our immune system to fight them better the more we are exposed to them.  Every time your immune system encounters these threats, it builds more weapons to identify and fight then. This is how we develop resistance.</p>
<p>The problem with allergic/anaphylactic reactions is that we don’t want our immune system to be reacting to something,  but because our immune system learns and adapts, it gets <em>stronger</em> every time it is exposed to the foreign thing. </p>
<p>So if you’re allergic to bee stings here’s what might happen. You get stung by a bee the first time and your immune system identifies the venom as a significant threat. The first time you get stung you may not experience much because your system is learning about it and developing weapons to fight it next time it comes around.  The second time you get stung, you could go into full anaphylaxis because your body is prepared for an “all hands on deck” response. Your body overreacts to the point of potentially killing you.  Legitimate responses to fight your bodies, invaders (swelling for instance) go completely overboard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This might be slightly more in depth than what you’re asking, but maybe someone will be interested. </p>
<p>Your body can produce 5 types of antibodies: IgA, IgM, IgG, IgD, and IgE. These all serve specific purposes, but for an allergic reaction, the two important antibodies are IgA and IgE.</p>
<p>IgA is the “first responder” antibody. It is continually secreted into the blood and tissues. Each IgA has a unique binding pattern that can recognize some form of foreign antigen (antigen is molecules that get presented or secreted by a cell, so foreign antigen simply means molecules made by something other than the self). Imagine IgA like a snowflake, each is different from one another in their pattern, which gives the body the ability to recognize a wide variety of foreign antigen. When one IgA binds to a foreign antigen, it undergoes something called “upregulation”, in which the body will begin to replicate the specific IgA to allow the body to better fight the infection. </p>
<p>IgA is used the first time you’re exposed to a new antigen. During/After the infection, the body will begin to produce more specific antibodies with better binding ability, so it can be better ready to kill the foreign body.</p>
<p>In a relatively poorly understood process, sometimes the body will begin to produce IgE as a response to antigen. IgE activates a massive immune response that activates a number of very dangerous immune cells that destroy not only the antigen, but also the surrounding tissue. This response is what we see macroscopically to be hives, rashes, swelling, and sometimes even anaphylaxis. </p>
<p>The change from an IgA response to an IgE response is why a second exposure to an allergen elicits so much worse of a response. To make things worse, your body will continue to produce more and more IgE the more often an immune response is elicited, meaning the more often you’re exposed to the allergen, the more sensitive to that allergen you become.</p>
<p>Sorry if this got a little term heavy, but that was the simplest way I could talk about the reactions occurring on a cellular level and answer the question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Other countries then decide how much to trust that letter. In most cases, it's based on an agreement that they will treat the other people a certain way. </p>
<p>If the trust is high, then other governments will just wave them through, like Canada and the US. Both countries are wealthy enough that passports can be issued with caution, and passports are generally hard to fake. There's also the fact that border agents see a TON of passports from the other country, and can quickly assess whether it's real or not. </p>
<p>Kyrgystan and Colombia, on the other hand, have far less basis for trust with each other - both are relatively poor countries with lots of corruption, so getting a real passport for a fake person is easier than it might be elsewhere. There are also probably very few of these seen in the other country, so a border agent in Colombia would have no easy way to figure out a fake passport. </p>
<p>This means that people from lesser known, poorer, or more corrupt countries would have to apply for a visa to travel, which is basically the other country having time to verify personal details before letting them in. </p>
<p>A big part of it is power, as well. America is able to coerce just about any other country to make American passports acceptable, because you don't want to annoy the world's wealthiest country, and accepting their passports is relatively low risk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Many factors are taken into account, but it's also highly political. For example, sometimes, if one country starts requiring visa for residents of another country, the other country will punitively respond by imposing a visa requirement of its own. Groups of nations such as the EU will make visa free zones to facilitate trade and relations. Wealth of the country is taken into account; residents of a wealthy country have less motivation to illegally immigrate, so it's considered less in need of travel restrictions.

<p>Or based on economic reasons. If you're trying to develop a tourist economy or attract foreign business investors, you will generally want it to be easier for people to get into your country. </p>
<p>Or alternatively, they may want to restrict people from certain countries for economic reasons because they don't want people from poor countries easily getting in looking for work. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tossing this in, the modern concept of visas and passports is a relatively new concept.  Started after WWI.</p>
<p>Passports have existed in many forms prior to WWI.  There use became less in Europe as train networks expanded. Vast numbers of travelers began crossing borders with little ability for countries to enforce them.</p>
<p>After WWI, more formal passport/visas systems started to develop to what we see today.</p>
<p>As others have noted here, the use of visas and requirements for entry became based on relationships between countries with various factors.</p>
<p>Asymmetry is common.  For example, I'm in the US. For me to travel to Turkey as a visitor, I pay about $20 online or at the point of entry for a visa that is valid for 4 months with stays no longer than 90 days (as of 2015 for my last trip there). For Turkish residents to come into the US, it's a little more effort to get the visa, but the US would grant it for a period of 10 years (again, as of 2015).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If the resistance increases (if you turn the volume knob down), then less voltage makes it to the speaker, the cone vibrates less intensely, and the sound is quieter. The opposite is true if you turn the volume up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends.</p>
<p>On purely analog devices audio is just an electric signal. When you adjust the gain you are controlling how much electricity you are letting through, like a water tap.</p>
<p>On digital devices this is more complicated but, generally speaking, when you press the volume buttons you are also controlling how much electricity is being sent to the speakers although not directly. Some code is interpreting your actions on the volume buttons and then this either results in the digital audio signal having less amplitude, or controlling the analog amplifier, or both.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have talked about potentiometers but OP asked about a &quot;wheel&quot; (which is not a knob) and a button.  The &quot;wheel&quot; is known as an encoder. It's a device that has many different positions. The device tracks which position the wheel was at and which position it has moved to. So it knows which direction the user is turning the wheel. If they turn it clockwise, then the system will send a signal to the amplifier to increase the gain (volume). If the user is turning it counter-clockwise then it will send a signal to lower the gain. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is what allows the user to continuously turn the wheel in a given direction. A regular knob has a fixed range and will only turn up to a certain point.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As for buttons, it's the same idea, there is a button for &quot;up&quot; and button for &quot;down&quot;. The system decides to increase the gain or lower the gain simply by which button is pressed. This is why you can have a touch screen with a volume slider . It's all digital information.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Our bodies aren’t designed to be running at absolute maximum capacity like that.   The adrenaline surge is an emergency measure, designed to get us out of trouble if we need it.  Very useful if you need a burst of speed to avoid a lion, or extra strength to wrestle a fallen tree off your toddler, but you don’t need that when you’re playing video games or hanging out at the pool.   </p>
<p>It is also pretty damaging to be in that state.   Adrenaline is not good for you, not long-term.   There is actually a maximum amount of time you can sustain the heightened state of adrenaline before it tapers off - even if the situation hasn’t changed.   This is because you run out of adrenaline, and also because your body literally cannot maintain the high alert state for more than a few hours <em>max</em>.   There is a longer-term, less extreme stress hormone called cortisol that takes over if the stressful situation is lasting longer than that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Being like that 24/7 will increase your anxiety to the point where you won't be able to function well.</p>
<p>Furthermore, adrenaline is like a drug. Adreneline junkies exist. And much like other drugs, they have to keep doing more and more crazy and dangerous stuff to feel the same 'rush' as normal people.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR at bottom (you can skip it if you don't prefer technicalities)</p>
<p>Adrenaline is a vasocontrictor- basically decreases diameter of blood vessels where blood is not required at the time of emergencies (like, digestive system, skin, etc.)</p>
<p>Sustained vasoconstriction increases blood pressure- leading to hypertension.</p>
<p>Moreover, it leads to increased heart beat- increased load on heart, susceptiblity to skipped beats (arrhythmias), and even atherosclerosis (plaque in arteries)</p>
<p>Having it 24x7 in the brain would induce lots of anxiety, to the point of paranoia and/or psychoses.</p>
<p>Increased pressure on blood vessels may lead to
1) rupture- as in stroke
2) kidney failure
3) retinopathy (blindness)</p>
<p>and a lot more.</p>
<p>TL;DR: It induces changes which can be withstood only for a short period of time without irreversible damage. So, bad for long term.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The meadow may just be in an early successional state where trees haven't grown back yet.  This would be due to a disturbance like a fire or landslide that killed the trees that had been there previously.</p>
<p>The meadow could be growing in a location where the environmental conditions don't support tree growth but do support grasses.  There could be a lack of water, the soil maybe very shallow, or the wind might be too extreme for trees.</p>
<p>It's also possible for grazing animals to keep growth low, so only plants that can come back from the roots like grasses will persist over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Trees evolve inhospitable toxins in their leaves that they drop on the ground below, and ally themselves with fungi in the ground that make it hard for grass to grow. Similarly, grasses evolve abilities to break down the toxins and have their own alliances with fungi. It’s an evolutionary arms race for territory, and the boundary between trees and meadows is the front line. </p>
<p>At least that’s the narrative explanation. I’m sure there’s a lot more to it than that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they are the same organism and share the same genome.  However, there are certainly major changes in gene expression that occur during metamorphosis as various developmental genes are activated or inactivated respectively.  I recommend <a href="http://www.biologiaevolutiva.org/xbelles/pdfs/2011-Belles-ELS.pdf" target="_blank">this review article</a> by Belles 2011, which is a good source of general information about insect metamorphosis.</p>
<p>For several decades now, it's been know that this process is initially triggered by hormonal signals, the most important of which are <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/AllJH.svg/1280px-AllJH.svg.png" target="_blank">juvenile hormones</a> (JH).  As the name implies, juvenile hormone is present at high levels in larvae, and metamorphosis begins once levels of JH drop below a certain threshold; this also means that exposing insects to JH can indefinitely prevent them from maturing to adulthood (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022191008000267?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">source</a>).  This property was somewhat unpleasantly discovered by Vincent Wigglesworth when he attached larvae of different stages together so they shared body fluids, which you can see in <a href="https://imgur.com/WMvyI0H" target="_blank">figure 3</a> from the Belles 2011 article I already linked.</p>
<p>So we know that the levels of hormones like this are responsible for <em>causing</em> metamorphosis, but the mechanics of how it happens on a genetic level are somewhat more complicated.  The main group of genes associated with metamorphosis appears to be the &quot;Broad-Complex&quot; of genes, named after the <a href="https://www.wikigenes.org/e/gene/e/44505.html" target="_blank">broad gene</a> in fruit flies.  This family of genes encodes transcription factor proteins that go on to regulate the expression of over 100 other genes (including themselves), and some of those downstream genes regulated by the Broad-Complex are themselves transcription factors (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8076529" target="_blank">source</a>).  There has been some work done to trace the labyrinthine web of relationships among these various developmental genes to figure out some of the finer details of how metamorphosis actually happens, but it's beyond the scope of my knowledge on this topic and this post is already long enough as it is.</p>
<p>In summary then, caterpillars and butterflies do indeed share all the same genes, but the changes that occur during their life cycle are based on the selective activation and repression of different groups of genes at different times.  From the outside, a freshly emerged butterfly may appear to be a completely different organism, but careful study has shown that there are clear anatomical connections between the larval and adult stages.  For example, insect larvae have blobs called <a href="https://www.sdbonline.org/sites/fly/lewheld/fig11.jpg" target="_blank">imaginal discs</a> composed of cells that already have specific preordained fates in the adult stage (<a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(10)00291-5.pdf" target="_blank">source</a>).  And to reference another neat experiment, it's been shown that memories from the larval stages can be retained as adults, so there definitely isn't any kind of sneaky switcheroo going on in between (<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001736" target="_blank">source</a>).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
