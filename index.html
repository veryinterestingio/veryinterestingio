<p>I read some time ago that overlapping interference is a lot worse so all modems should use either 1, 6, or 11. But I see a lot of modems in my neighbourhood using all the channels from 1-11, causing an overlapping nightmare. Why do modem manufacturers allow overlapping to happen in the first place?</p>
<p>Edit: To clarify my question, some countries allow use of all channels and some don't. This means some countries' optimal channels are 1, 5, 9, 13, while other countries' optimal channels are 1, 6, 11. Whichever the case, in those specific countries, all modems manufactured should be hard limited to use those optimal channels only. But modems can use any channel and cause overlapping interference. I just don't understand why modems manufacturers allow overlapping to happen in the first place. The manufacturers, of all people, should know that overlapping is worse than same channel interference...</p>
<p>To add a scenario, in a street of houses closely placed, it would be ideal for modems to use 1, 6, 11. So the first house on the street use channel 1, second house over use channel 6, next house over use channel 11, next house use channel 1, and so on. But somewhere in between house channel 1 and 6, someone uses channel 3. This introduces overlapping interference for all the 3 houses that use channels 1, 3, 6. In this case, the modem manufacturer should hard limit the modems to only use 1, 6, 11 to prevent this overlapping to happen in the first place. But they are manufactured to be able to use any channel and cause the overlap to happen. Why? This is what I am most confused about.</p></div></div>

The 1-6-11 is used because of the U.S. refuses to allow use of channel 13, or, in Japan, to allow channel 14 to be fully non-overlapping.</p>
<p>In addition, there are uses for half-overlapping channels. When a large area needs to be covered, you have 3 non-overlapping channels nearby, and further away you use half-overlapping channels, where the weak overlapping signals won't cause as great a problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Remember that when the standard was settled upon, the designers had absolutely no idea how ubiquitous WiFi would become. It would be approximately another ten years before WiFi routers would even start to become household appliances. Zip drives were state-of-the-art, laptop thickness was measured in <em>inches</em>, and the concept of a smartphone was about a decade away from public consciousness. People rented VHS cassettes to watch movies at home on their rear-projection TVs, and HD television was for the idle rich. Netflix had just started mailing people DVDs via The Postal Service.</p>
<p>Okay, I'm getting a little carried away describing the world of the late 90s, but it's important to remember the designers of the 802.11 standards had to make choices in a world where households rich enough to even have internet access connected to the internet via dialup. No one even conceptualized a world where routers would be so cheap that every single tenant in an apartment building would have their own radio transmitter sitting in a closet gathering dust out of sight, out of mind. Many of the choices they made for the standard naturally assumed wireless internet access would only really be deployed by professional network admins who would have control of all the other routers in range. Why not let them choose any channel?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The standard allows the choice of any channel in the range to best suit the user's wishes.     But let's just say everyone sticks to 1/6/11 and those three bands are heavily congested.       Anyone setting up a new radio in a congested area will find a LOT of interference centered around each of those three channels.</p>
<p>Someone else gets tired and decides that to avoid interference he should select something in the middle of the overlapping bands like channel 3.    And suddenly now you have someone who has a relatively clear channel, but now 1 and 6 have some interference from another channel in addition to everyone else already on 1/6.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>They don't actually store electricity. When they say they have extra, what they mean is they have the generators to make more than they need. If the generators are at a dam using water to make electricity, it's hard to &quot;save&quot; the extra capacity because if the water doesn't flow through the dam there will be a flood upstream. So they have to let the water flow downstream without using it to make electricity. Some places, they actually use the extra water to make electricity, then use that electricity to pump water uphill into a storage reservoir, where they can use it later. That tends to happen at night, when everyone's asleep and not using electricity. In fact power companies typically charge less for electricity at night to encourage factories to use it when people are asleep and not using it.</p>
<p>A power company needs enough generators to supply power at the time of highest demand. Then some of those generators sit and do nothing when demand is lower, and a machine doing nothing is a waste of money, so power companies look for ways to keep the generators running all the time so they are making money instead of sitting doing nothing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There are all kinds of possible ways to do this. Some are more efficient than others, and they all have their own problems and suitable applications.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>For long term storage, you can pump water uphill into a reservoir, and then turn it back into electricity as needed. Though usually cheaper to skip the uphill pumping and rely on rain. </p>
<p>The vast majority of the power generated is used in less than a second. Often they'll have spare generators already spun up and ready so they can increase power generation more quickly. They'll also predict load based on past usage.

<blockquote>
<p>A team of Ontario researchers says their latest study could help pave the way for different approaches to treating depression.</p>
<p>The study – completed at McMaster University’s Brain-Body Institute and published this week in Scientific Reports – concluded a common class of antidepressants works by stimulating activity in the gut and key nerves connected to it rather than the brain as previously believed.</p>
<p>The research focused on Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), a type of antidepressant that’s known to benefit patients but whose functioning is little understood by the medical community.</p>
<p>The McMaster researchers spent nearly a year testing SSRIs on mice in a bid to solve the puzzle.</p>
<p>They found that mice taking the medication showed much greater stimulation of neurons in the gut wall, as well as the vagus nerve that connects the gut to the brain. Those benefits disappeared if the vagus nerve was surgically cut.</p>
<p>Study co-author Karen-Anne McVey Neufeld says the findings suggest the gut may play a larger role in depression than previously believed and the latest research hints at new treatment possibilities in the future.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, intestinal bacteria can synthesize and consume neurotransmitters such as serotonin and gamma-aminobutyrate. See:</p>
<p>Serotonin: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25078296" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25078296</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is also substantial overlap between behaviours influenced by the gut microbiota and those which rely on intact serotonergic neurotransmission . . .The mechanisms underpinning this crosstalk require further elaboration but may be related to the ability of the gut microbiota to control host tryptophan metabolism along the kynurenine pathway, thereby simultaneously reducing the fraction available for serotonin synthesis and increasing the production of neuroactive metabolites. The enzymes of this pathway are immune and stress-responsive, both systems which buttress the brain-gut axis. In addition, there are neural processes in the gastrointestinal tract which can be influenced by local alterations in serotonin concentrations with subsequent relay of signals along the scaffolding of the brain-gut axis to influence CNS neurotransmission.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GABA: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-018-0307-3" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-018-0307-3</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The gut microbiota affects many important host functions, including the immune response and the nervous system. . . . Bioassay-driven purification of B. fragilis supernatant led to the isolation of the growth factor, which, surprisingly, is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid). GABA was the only tested nutrient that supported the growth of KLE1738, and a genome analysis supported a GABA-dependent metabolism mechanism. Using growth of KLE1738 as an indicator, we isolated a variety of GABA-producing bacteria, and found that Bacteroides ssp. produced large quantities of GABA. Genome-based metabolic modelling of the human gut microbiota revealed multiple genera with the predicted capability to produce or consume GABA. A transcriptome analysis of human stool samples from healthy individuals showed that GABA-producing pathways are actively expressed by Bacteroides, Parabacteroides and Escherichia species. By coupling 16S ribosmal RNA sequencing with functional magentic resonance imaging in patients with major depressive disorder, a disease associated with an altered GABA-mediated response, we found that the relative abundance levels of faecal Bacteroides are negatively correlated with brain signatures associated with depression.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These can affect nearby nerves (in particular the vagus nerve) which might have some effects on the brain. The paper linked in the top post is a study showing that SSRIs (which inhibit serotonin reuptake) increase vagal nerve activity. Gut-synthesized neurotransmitters generally can't make it all the way into the brain because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier" target="_blank">blood-brain barrier</a> (a layer of cells which keeps them out).</p>
<p>There are many <em>correlational</em> studies showing a link between the gut microbiome and depresssion (example: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00483-5" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00483-5</a>), but showing causation is much trickier (for example, depression might cause changes in diet which alter the microbiome). Still, I think based on the neurotransmitter studies there's some good evidence for a role. The immune system also might be involved (some microbes could cause inflammation, and there's some evidence for a role of inflammation in depression: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30368652" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30368652</a>).</p>
<p>Finally, intestinal bacteria can break down medications (<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6445/eaau6323" target="_blank">for example, levodopa</a> for Parkinson's) and indirectly affect brain function.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first experiment designed to test whether atomic orbital angular momentum was quantized is called the Stern Gerlach experiment. In it they used silver atoms that have one unpaired election orbiting the outer shell. They passed them through an inhomogeneous magnetic field to deposit into a collector plate. When they checked the plate after the experiment to see if they could detect quantized splitting the plate appeared blank. They thought they had failed.</p>
<p>But back in this day the scientists could smoke cigars in the lab (!!!)
Cheap cigars emit more hydrogen sulfide. After looking at the plate for a while trying to see anything, the sulfur from their breath reacted with the silver creating a black silver sulfide later that became visible. The silver had been there but such a thin later it couldn't be seen until they &quot;developed&quot; it like a photograph with their cheap cigars.</p>
<p>What they found was the silver deposit was split into two distinct bands indicating that orbital angular momentum was quantized into discrete orientations in space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few things. Since this is ELI5 I'll keep them to short bullet points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Previous generations had an america centric economy where every other power was playing catch up, poor, or recovering from WWII. This is no longer the case. A lot of the jobs done in the west are now done elsewhere.</li>
<li>Because there's higher competition for those jobs, employers can get away with paying less. Because if you won't take it someone else will because we're all fighting for a smaller number of jobs.</li>
<li>Minimum wage hasn't kept up with inflation in a long, long time. A minimum wage worker in 1978 was making the equivalent of $14.71 at minimum wage, but their actual pay in 2019 is $7.25, or less than half as much. So the minimum is worth far less.</li>
<li>Cost of living has also gone up so those fewer dollars won't go as far. Big ticket items like cars and homes are increasing in price faster than the cost of living. A car was about $4,645.00, which would be a bit over ten thousand dollars in 2019 money, in 1978.  A modern car costs a little under forty thousand on average now.</li>
<li>This is also true of basic day to day items. Milk and bread have increased in price far beyond inflation. Gas has increased even more dramatically. So the fewer dollars you're getting are getting eaten up just getting by.</li>
<li>College tuition's have gone up to an even greater degree. More colleges are rebranding and remodeling to take in increasing tuitions that can only be paid for by student loans. College funds were common for a lot of households but even if they could hold on to that money it was basically irrelevant since an education costs as much as a new car. Which means you pay for a career you haven't started by taking on loans you hope you can afford later. Which, as we see for the first three points, is contingent on you getting a job that may not even exist when you graduate.</li>
<li>Gen Z came of age during and after the housing crisis of 2007. Even by those standards the economy was bad. Calling what happened a recession essentially underplays that it was essentially a second great depression that made all of the above worse. </li>
<li>As a result of all this heavy economic insecurity a lot of people just aren't marrying or having kids. You don't exactly need a house for one or two people and if someone is judging potential partners based on lifestyle(and implicitly or explicitly income) they're going to be screening out the people most affected by this. The amount of young people who aren't even sexually active, let alone in a relationship or planning for a family, has gone up dramatically in the last decade. If you don't have more people you also don't exactly need a newer safer car even if you're one of the ones who can afford it.</li>

<p>My dad - a blue collar tradesman - bought his first house at the age of 25 in 1990. Speaking to him now, when he looks at the income of the young people in his industry now there is no way in hell they could afford to buy a house.</p>
<p>Going further back, my grandparents raised 4 kids on the salary of my grandfather who was a police officer at the time. My grandmother was a stay at home mom. This was in the 70s and 80s. All 4 kids were put through school, never lacked anything and there was even enough money for annual family vacations. Absolutely no way you are even raising two kids on a police officers salary today and living the lifestyle my grandparents did.</p>
<p>I'm not American. I'm not even from Europe. This is a global thing. Gen Y got screwed. Hard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's three main things. Mostly.</p>
<p>One: Wages haven't gone up much.  For every dollar increase in the minimum wage since 1970, the price of an average item has gone up $1.36. When you look at most average people, their paycheque still buys the same amount of basic things at the store as it did 40 years ago. </p>
<p>Two: the things you mentioned cost much much more than they used to, but there isn't more money to pay for them. The only way most people make money is with their time, so that's an easy way to see how much harder it's gotten. </p>
<p>In 1970, you could work 755 hours a year at a minimum wage job to pay for a year of post secondary – that's 14 hours per week. You can work 14 hours a week and still do university.</p>
<p>In 2010, you would have to work 1,823 hours – that's 35 hours per week, otherwise known as &quot;full time work&quot;. It's very hard to work full time but also go to university. But 70% of jobs now want a university degree (40% in the 70's), so people go into debt to get a degree to get a job, but then they can't buy a house or a car because they have so much debt. </p>
<p>It's the same with houses: in 1970 an average house was $23,600. In 2011? $240,100.
Wages haven't gone up and paycheques still buy the same amount of stuff but a house costs 10x what it used to. </p>
<p>Three: The things you said have become investments that don't get shared as much. Our parents were much more likely to get a first car as a hand me down, or help getting a first house, or getting the family house when their parents retired and moved to Florida.</p>
<p>Now, our parents are living longer and better lives but they have less money, so they're not retiring and moving away, they don't give up their cars, and they don't have lots of money to share to help us buy our own.</p>
<p>Our grandparents got to ride a really great wave of lots of people making money and things generally getting better for everybody. So our parents got a really easy start to adult life with cheap cars and houses to buy early and lots of help to get settled.</p>
<p>But things slowed down by the time we were born, so our parents couldn't help us out as much. And when we became adults our cheques pretty much stopped growing, and everything has been pretty tough since then. There's no way to get ahead when you're spending all your money on basic stuff, there's no help from outside when your parents can't afford to give you big gifts, and any little disaster like an unexpected hospital bill can ruin everything when you don't have any savings or a house to sell. </p>
<p>That's long but hopefully basic enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A country you mean?</p>
<p>Into and out of every country there are surprisingly only a few high bandwidth fiber optic cables. These are used for everything: phone, cell/wireless, internet data you name it (everything gets converted to IP packet switched behind the scenes nowadays anyway). These lines and the junction point/switches and routers where they break out into smaller connections to go the last mile to your house or work are consolidated in one or two data centers at the telcos in your country. Not only that, but usually just one or two telcos actually went and laid the cables, the others in your country just lease bandwidth from those. </p>
<p>So when President Junta decides to cut off Facebook because the Rebels posted a picture of him having sexual relations with a burro, the head of the police just has to call one or two telcos and say &quot;Cut off the internet or we cut off your head.&quot;... from there, the folks in the network operations center really just have to click a few clicks to disable the links with the outside world.</p>
<p>Example: this is the <a href="https://www.submarinecablemap.com/#/" target="_blank">worldwide submarine cable map.</a> These are the fiber optic cables that run along the sea floor and connect countries via the oceans. Zoom in - quite a few countries are only connected to one, or two of these massive internet backbone/telecommunications cables. Literally if you were to know where to look, there'd be a thickly sheilded cable running up out of the ocean and up the beach to a little shack with a bunch of network gear in it (its a little more complicated than that, but not by much.)... There are terrestrial and satellite links too, but the principal is the same: its expensive to set these international internet/telecom cables up, so they're done surprisingly infrequently. Thanks to the wonder of switched internet packet protocols, if one link goes down (some idiot with a back-hoe), traffic will re-route to another available connection, but its always possible to disconnect an entire country's set of internet connections.</p>
<p>edit: and by disable links, usually nothing gets unplugged. All you have to do is disable the routing protocols that allow data traffic to flow in/out of the country.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>your muscles (and your entire body) use ATP (adenosine triphosphate - there are 3 phosphates) for energy. when ATP is used, it loses a phosphate group and becomes ADP (adenosine diphosphate - 2 phosphates). creatine, which is phosphocreatine in your muscles, donates a phosphate group to ADP so it becomes ATP again. this is much faster than than the krebs cycle that would be used otherwise.</p>
<p>it does not help with muscle building directly. it allows for like a 5% performance boost at most so you can get that extra rep in, which over time can cause a slightly greater stimulus for growth than if you did not use creatine.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSPmsqYRL2Y" target="_blank">jeff nippard is great at explaining things</a></p>
<p>also, you need to be saturated with creatine for it to do anything. its not something like caffeine in which you take it and you feel the effects soon after.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Creatine is used to regenerate ATP, the source of energy which gets your muscles to do stuff. It is very efficient, so it is able to keep up the amount of ATP muscle cells have. It is also the first way your muscles regenerate ATP, the other ways being anaerobic glycolysis and cellular respiration. But these only take place after your stored creatine is used up. Creatine would essentially give you more &quot;energy&quot; to lift. Maybe not the right word, but it would probably help you lift for longer because you have more ATP to use before they are depleted. I doubt it would help you gain muscle mass though, it has no direct effect on the regeneration of muscle fibers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So your muscles obviously need energy to be able to contract the way they do, and the main molecule that supplies this energy is called adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. However, since ATP is so energetic, it's really unstable and takes a lot of energy to make, and even more energy to maintain. Thus, it doesn't make much sense for your body to keep ATP ready on demand-- rather, it makes ATP as needed for your muscles. This is done by adding a phosphate group to a molecule called adenosine diphosphate, or ADP. However, the process of converting ADP to ATP takes a few seconds. But if I want to throw a punch, my muscles don't take a few seconds before I'm ready-- it's pretty much instantaneous.</p>
<p>This is because your body keeps creatine on hand. In your body, creatine is usually bonded to a phosphate group to make a molecule called phosphocreatine (CP). CP has this property where it exchanges phosphate groups in equilibrium with ADP. Basically, this means that occasionally CP will donate its phosphate group to ADP, creating a small amount of ATP and converting CP to creatine. However, as soon as this ATP molecule forms, it usually immediately loses its phosphate group to another creatine molecule, forming ADP and CP. You can think of this as creatine and ADP playing catch with a phosphate group. When creatine has the &quot;ball,&quot; it's CP, and when ADP has the &quot;ball,&quot; it's ATP.</p>
<p>However, when you tell your muscles to contract, as soon as the ATP forms, it is immediately put to use to contract your muscle. A lower amount of ATP means that the remaining CP is converted even faster to creatine and ATP. So essentially, whenever CP passes phosphate to ADP, ADP turns to ATP and is immediately used up, so no more CP is created, since there isn't anything around to pass the &quot;ball&quot; back to creatine.</p>
<p>This goes on for a few seconds, at which point your CP reserves are depleted. But its OK, since by that time other more permanent pathways have started up to convert ADP to ATP. So basically, creatine serves as a source of immediate energy for your muscles (just a few seconds) while your actual machinery powers up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is insanely complicated, but let's start with some simple concepts.</p>
<p><strong>Population estimate:</strong> All vertebrates have kidneys.  Not all animals have kidneys.  So you're really only looking at a subset of the animal population.  Ants for example don't have kidneys, but there are 10,000 trillion alive at any one time.  We need to estimate the number of vertebrates alive at any given moment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fish are about 5-10 trillion</li>
<li>Mammals are about 100 billion to 1 trillion</li>
<li>Birds are about 100 billion</li>
<li>Reptiles somewhere between 1-10 trillion</li>
</ul>
<p>So an estimate of somewhere between <strong>6.2-20.2 trillion</strong> vertebrates alive on Earth right now.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>GFR estimate:</strong> A good <a href="https://www.vetfolio.com/learn/article/glomerular-filtration-rate-in-general-small-animal-practice" target="_blank">GFR</a> estimate is \~3 mL/min/kg for small animals which are the majority of vertebrates, some larger some smaller but we have to get an average somehow.  And a decent estimate of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698904001646" target="_blank">body weight average for vertebrates</a> is around 0.572 kg.  This leaves us with an estimate of <strong>1.716 mL/min</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Time estimate:</strong> Next you have a time frame of around 500 million years for vertebrates.  This population density hasn't been consistent over that period, so it's important to remember that as an estimate this is going to be the second biggest component of the error involved here because we also don't have super accurate counts for species and population density over that time frame.  <strong>500 million years</strong> is the number we have though so we'll go with that period.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>One year calculation:</strong> We'll go with a middle number of 10 trillion vertebrates at an average weight of 0.572 kg.  This would mean that each minute we have 10 trillion x 1.716 mL/min of fluid filtered.</p>
<p>1.716 x 10^(13) mL/min (525,600 min/year) = 9.02 x 10^(18) mL/year</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Total Vertebrate history GFR estimate = 4.5 x 10</strong>^(27) <strong>mL</strong></p>
<p><strong>Water on Earth</strong> = 1.26 x 10^(21) L = <strong>1.26 x 10</strong>^(24) <strong>mL</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>Rough Estimate: 3,000 times</h1>
<p>(now someone check my maths and let me know where I did wrongs)</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the silver!<br />
Edit: thanks for Gold! Wow, thanks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The more important question: how long does a single water molecule stay intact?  You know that water undergoes a process called self-ionization (aka autoionization, or autodissociation)... one of the two hydrogen atoms (as a proton ion) will leave the water molecule and hop to another water molecule.  In all likelihood, it won't be coming back.  This happens once <em>every 10 hours.</em>  In other words, much, much, MUCH faster than the average water cycle.  So it's not really relevant to talk about how many times a single water molecule goes through an animal kidney, since that single water molecule itself doesn't survive for more than a day or two.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, let's do the math and get an order-of-magnitude estimate.</p>
<p>Let's interpret &quot;kidney&quot; very generously -- worms and snails don't have kidneys, but they have something similar -- and talk about water flow through all animals on Earth.</p>
<p>Let's use humans as a typical animal, since they're well-studied.  The average human <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine" target="_blank">urinates</a> about 1.4 liter per day.  So <em>all</em> humans urinate about 10^7 (10 million) cubic meters per day -- about 4000 olympic swimming pools' worth.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/115/25/6506" target="_blank">this paper</a>, there are about 0.06 gigatons of carbon in all the humans on Earth, and 2 gigatons of carbon in all animals.  So let's assume the total mass of animals is 2/.06 = 33 times the mass of humans.  Assuming humans are typical in their urine production per biomass (more on that later), that means all animals produce about 3 x 10^8 cubic meters per day, or 0.3 km^3 /day.  That's a pool 1 km x 1 km x 300 meters deep.</p>
<p>The total volume of all the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_distribution_on_Earth" target="_blank">surface water on Earth</a> is about 1.4 billion km^3.  To flush all of this through organisms at a rate of 0.3 km^3 /day would take about 5 billion days, or 13 million years.</p>
<p>Animals have existed for about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion" target="_blank">500 million years</a>.  If we make the extremely sketchy assumption that the total mass of animals has remained fairly constant over geologic time, we end up with the result that the average molecule of water has been through an animal <strong>about 40 times</strong>.</p>
<p>However, a couple of caveats on this answer.</p>
<p>1) Humans may not be typical urine producers.  In particular, since we're evolved as an arid land species that needs to conserve water, we may produce less urine than, say, a freshwater fish.  On the other hand, ocean animals (which are the majority of the biomass) also have to conserve fresh water because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmoregulation" target="_blank">osmosis through their skin.</a></p>
<p>2) This includes only Earth's surface and crustal water.  The Earth's mantle contains even more water (1.5 to 11 times as much) chemically locked in the rocks, and over 500 million years it may exchange with the surface.</p>
<p>Given all these uncertainties, I think the best we can say is that the average drop of water has been through an animal <strong>probably more than once, probably less than 1000 times.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a very common misconception that inbreeding &quot;weakens genetics&quot; or is otherwise harmful.</p>
<p>When two animals mate, a bunch of genes from the father and a bunch of genes from the mother combine to form one set of genes. When that child mates, a bunch of that set of genes will be combined with a bunch of genes from that child's mate to create one set of genes for the child, and so on. This is why you are not a clone of your parents, but you probably have some similar features to both parents.</p>
<p>If a mating pair is related (e.g. if they have the same parents), then their genes are going to be similar. This is because both sets of genes were created by combining the same two sets of parent genes. They won't be identical because different parts may be represented by different parents in different sets, but they will be similar. This is why you are not a clone of your siblings, but you probably have some similar features to eachother.</p>
<p>When parents have similar genes, it increases the likelihood that recessive genes will be expressed. Recessive genes are not necessarily harmful, but most harmful genetic disorders are recessive. This is why &quot;blue blood&quot; diseases were more common among incestuous royalty; the recessive gene was more likely to not get paired up with a dominant gene because both parents had the recessive gene.</p>
<p>The genes of the children are not in any way &quot;weaker.&quot; A gene cannot be &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;weak.&quot; It's just an instruction for proteins. In this situation, the only consequence is that recessive traits found in Diego, whether they are good/bad/neutral, will be more likely to be expressed in the children of his children. Over many generations and through random mutation, this will not be very noticeable.</p>
<p>Another factor is genetic diversity. Genetic diversity is beneficial because it helps a population adapt to changing environments. Inbreeding reduces genetic diversity. This factor is more of a &quot;big picture&quot; factor, in that it has no effect in the short term. Its effects are shown over hundreds of generations in changing environments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people are talking about natural mating here, but in a lot of &quot;saved species from extinction&quot; situations, there are actually intensive managed breeding programs. Usually these attempt to maximize diversity in the breeding population by pairing captive animals from different regions or with different traits. Now, with genetic sequencing, some breeding programs are able to actually optimize the breeding program by minimizing the number of similar genes between the two partners.</p>
<p>But there's a lot of other genetic concepts here that people don't draw distinctions between. For example, the appearance of recessive traits (meaning there was a recessive gene in both patents) and the fixation of traits. Recessive genes always exist in a population, and they aren't necessarily bad. What is bad is when alleles (essentially mutant versions of a gene) with negative effects get <em>fixed</em> in a population, which means that they become a very common variant in the population, possibly the only version of the gene that exists. An example of this is certain dog breeds that are prone to certain diseases, like lymphoma or hip problems.</p>
<p>Immune system homogeneity is another issue. The immune system is supposed to be extremely diverse at every scale you can think of (from individual genes to individual cells to individuals to populations). This protects the overall population from disease because the disease will only be super lethal in a certain percentage of the population (the percentage that can't resist it). But if a population's immune genes become more homogeneous, then its resistance to disease is much lower. This is a huge issue in plants, especially crops, because many of them are literal clones, so a disease that is lethal to one of them is lethal to all of them. So not only does a loss of genetic diversity make them more resistant to disease, it also ensures that there will be further mass die-offs,  which make the population even more homogeneous.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
