		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey all, non-directed living donor here. I made the decision to donate to a stranger for my 30th birthday. I’m so glad I had the opportunity to do so. It’s been 2 years since my donation surgery and I’ve not experienced any adverse health effects. I’ve become quite close with my recipient and will always view him as one of my closest friends. One of the downsides I could potentially see, especially if you’re a non-directed donor, is that once you make the decision to donate, you can’t control the choices your recipient may make in the future.  As has been said, the donation process is a surgery involving total anesthesia and there is always some risk associated with any surgery. Also, the recovery process can be painful as the abdominal muscles they cut through are used for almost every movement. Coughing and sneezing are especially painful for a few weeks. Lastly, the donor is left with some gnarly-looking scars on their abdomen. Overall though, I would absolutely do it again if I had the opportunity. In complete transparency, knowing that I did something so life-altering for my fellow human gives me a massive ego boost. Feel free to reach out to me directly if you have more specific questions about the donation process. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This is supported by another article I found (reference 2 in the linked paper), but unfortunately it’s behind a paywall. Pregnancy is extremely stressful to most of the body’s systems, kidneys included. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2747242/?report=reader" target="_blank">This article</a> equates the stress of pregnancy on one kidney to the stress of having twins or triplets with two kidneys.</p>
<p>There are also downsides to the surgery itself and the recovery afterwards, though those outcomes are usually good.</p>
<p>All that said, living donation is the safest form of kidney transplantation and has the best outcomes. If you have more questions my partner is a kidney transplant scientist; we’ll be happy to answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

No heavy drinking, no ibuprofen/aspirin - and that's pretty much it. I also have to go in for yearly checkups (something I didn't do before) to keep an eye on my blood pressure. Having one kidney doesn't <em>increase</em> your risk of hypertension, it just makes things go awry faster if it does happen to develop.</p>
<p>EDIT: Hell, I'll evangelize on here. I have absolutely no regrets about the procedure and would encourage anyone interested to check it out. Google your regional hospital network, find out if they have a transplant program, and email them. That's how I got started, and they give you plenty of points along the way to back out without judgement. My recipient was 21, and if all goes right, will be with her new kidney through her 40s. She can have a career, get married, travel, start a family - whatever she wants to do, all because I had a kidney to give. 10/10 would donate again if I had another one</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The whiskey before it is put into barrels is just alcohol and water, so what gives?  </p>
<p>Also, why can't we find out what the specific compounds are in really expensive bottles of whiskey, synthesize them in a lab, and then mix them with alcohol and water to produce cheaper, exact replicas of the really expensive whiskeys?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, bear with me on this one.</p>
<p>The steps in determining the chemical process are extraction, oxidation, concentration and filtration. There's evaporation and colouration in there too, but we can safely ignore those as they're secondary.</p>
<p>The extraction gets the alcohol out of a mash. It brings with it esters, fusel alcohols, aldehydes, and organic acids which impart smooth vanilla flavours. Depending on exactly how this is done, determines the initial organics profile. Even the water used is important, Scottish distilleries prize the streams which run out of peat bogs, and use peat smoke to character their malt.</p>
<p>When whisky hits a barrel, the barrel itself determines what's going to happen. The barrel should have held some other, more flavoursome, alcohol in its previous life, such as port or brandy for a nice Scotch, but virgin barrels can be used for whisky too.</p>
<p>Alcohol and water are great solvents, and they leach chemicals out of the barrel. If the barrel has been charred (and if not, what you're making is drain cleaner or rocket fuel, not whisky!) then this imparts combustion products into the wood, from breakdown of lignins. (Edit: I should have noted this at the time, but whisky producers call this caramelisation. It isn't strictly caramelisation, but it's fairly close)</p>
<p>This charring gets you the esters and phenols. In time, the organics, including those from the charred barrel, will oxidise, as a barrel is not an entirely sealed environment and wood is porous. Alcohol will evaporate (the &quot;angels' share&quot;) and oxygen gets in. This is considered good. After about twenty years, everything that's going to oxidise probably already has.</p>
<p>The main &quot;whisky taste&quot; is cis-3-methyl-4-octanolide, a lactone very important for whisky, and responsible for the coconut aroma of a good Scotch. The other compounds important are congeners and fusel alcohols. Fusel alcohols are extremely bad tasting and too much is a fault, but you need some for the harsh character. Congeners are other organics, like branched alcohols, esters, aldehydes and ketones. These typically oxidise to aldehydes and ketones and can contain several functional groups as a result.</p>
<p>We know all of these and we can manufacture or isolate them.</p>
<p>So yes, you can synthesise a good whisky, but everyone's definition of &quot;good whisky&quot; is different, because it is art, not science. It's much like a lab diamond, it's &quot;not real&quot;, even if it is chemically identical.</p>
<p>What you buy in a bottle of single malt scotch is the result of many casks from many years, all blended by the master distiller and his blenders to produce that distillery's &quot;taste&quot;.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: So my first comment to get gilded combines my degree (BSc Chemistry) and booze. I think it speaks for itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Someone gave you your best answer, but if you're in a bar and want a good answer here's a simple one you can remember:</p>
<p>Casks sit on racks for years. In the summer, the liquid inside expands into the porous container, and in the winter in contracts. This happens over and over and each time the liquid brings in complex organic compounds from the wood called congeners. Each cycle a little bit is lost to the atmosphere, called the Angel's share. This is why the older a scotch is (or really any aged spirit) the more expensive. There's simply less volume to sell for more time and labor commitment. Some is also lost to the barrel and this is the Devils share, though this is more or less constant regardless of how much aging happens.
This interaction causes a lot to also happen, like allow O2 in for oxidation, and in turn atmospheric conditions. For instance, you can taste the sea salt of an Islay Scotch, which almost certainly had its rack house doors open facing the sea. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Medical school professor here. Fun fact: your nose is filled with erectile tissue that engorges with blood, just like our naughty bits. The function of this erectile tissue is to use blood warm and moisten the air we breathe. But, when the erectile tissue engorges, it can block airflow, making it hard to breathe. So the erectile tissue on the right and left sides take turns engorging so we can always breathe through one nostril. This is called the nasal cycle.</p>
<p>Body posture can affect the duration of the cycle on each side. If you sleep more on your right side or lean your head to the right side preferentially, the engorgement will happen for longer on the right side (this is called right nasal dominance).</p>
<p>When you get sick and your nose fills with mucus, we become more aware of this dominance.</p>
<p>What about your ear? Well, the back of your nose (nasopharynx) is connected to your middle ear by the auditory tube, so congestion of the right side of your nasal cavity can spread to your middle ear on the right side.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

On a normal basis, it swells a little on one side, then the other. When you're sick or if you have swollen turbinates (like mine, which required a surgery to reduce, a long with a septoplasty to correct a deviated septum) they can cut off air flow in one nostril while they're swollen.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Harmonious tones are the result of overlapping frequencies. </p>
<p>Every tone played by an instrument (or voice) is composed of multiple frequencies, and if two tones share a lot of frequencies, humans can sense that instinctively in the way our brains perceive sound. Your ear is filled with arrays of tiny hairs of varying lengths which each vibrate to specific frequencies (sending nerve signals), so two tones which share frequencies set more hairs of different lengths vibrating.</p>
<p>Musical scales are built up of tones that share varying levels of harmony, i.e., shared frequencies. For example the &quot;dominant&quot; relationship (interval) is the strongest harmony. This is the first two tones of &quot;Twinkle Twinkle Little Star&quot;. The two tones naturally sound good together in sequence or overlapped. Other intervals in the scale are progressively less harmonious, and the scale contains enough tones to be useful without being cluttered with unharmonious tones. When we hear &quot;wrong&quot; tones, it's because they share few frequencies and do not blend. The closer two tones are in frequency (within the range of on octave, or twice the freqeuncy), the less they harmonize. So two tones that are next to each other on an instrument normally don't sound good together. And two tones that are even closer - like the same note on two guitars that are not tuned to each other - sound horrible. It's like watching two sets of turn signals that are slightly off in frequency.</p>
<p>So, while musical sense does depend to a degree on training and repeated exposure to the scale through hearing melodies (tone sequences), much of it is instinctual and based on the physics of sound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wow, lots of very wrong explanations in here already. Short version: the vast majority of it is cultural and we simply get used to certain sounds. Traditional Asian music is tuned very differently from Western music and would sound out of tune to us in the West. That would mean different harmonies and melodies etc.</p>
<p>As for where these preferences originally come from on a super basic level, the theory is that it comes from the overtone series. When you hit a note on a piano string, you’re hearing the fundamental frequency plus a set of other “notes” that are also ringing subtly. The major scale is somewhat derived from the stronger overtones in that series, and sounds pleasant because it comes from this “natural” phenomenon. That’s the current theory anyway, nobody has really proven it and it’s unlikely there’s any way to do so. If you go back in music history, the first use of harmony was basically singing a 5th above the melody all the time (in Gregorian chant). The fifth is the first and strongest overtone in the series (after the octave, which isn’t considered a harmony). So that’s a bit of simple evidence for how harmony developed in the very early days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>First though: music is NOT universal. It is not a universal language, in any way shape or form. The Baby Einstein/classical music making your kid smarter is *not* a thing. This is a very eurocentric idea.</p>
<p>Rhythm, tone, pacing (beats per minute) - the 'basic mood' of the music may be conveyed across cultures because of the way that people speak. But the way the notes relate to each other and how phrases are resolved to invoke a specific mood or feeling are more learned.</p>
<p>Think of Stravinsky's 'Rite of Spring', at the time that it was introduced, it was cacophonous noise, the notes didn't relate to each other 'right', the phrases didn't resolve 'right'. It was 'new age bullshit noise' at the time. Now, though, most people on reddit hear that music and think of Dinosaurs and volcanoes and stuff (from Disney's Fantasia)- that's our context for the music. And even though it sounds different, we still hear it as music.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>...that's about all I've got. Correct me if I'm wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people here are saying it's completely or mostly cultural. I disagree. Yes, the nature of the sound and the familiarity with the different scale and note systems play a part, but the basis is physical - how do certain frequencies react to one another. You don't have to learn to know if two tones work together, you can hear it by the oscillations they create together, what kind of wave they are combined. Not to say that what is or isn't a pleasant or unpleasant oscillation is completely universal, but they still aren't 100% arbitrary. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

The solution was a big propaganda push emphasizing the superiority of “ancient” Chinese medicine, which was at that time an eclectic collection of folk remedies. Most of the animals used in traditional Chinese medicine were found in China, but the principles behind it could be extended to other animals - if the recipe calls for parts from a big, strong creature, surely a rhino would be very good medicine. So Now there was a large market with a large demand, and savvy suppliers stepped in to fuel that demand and make profits. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

So these animals used to be the symbol of the rich and powerful. As ancient medicine has all sorts of bad side effects (see bloodletting, trepanning, and mercury for immortality), the methods that do the least harm are the ones that survive, since sometimes the improving health of the patient can be falsely attributed to the medicine, rather than to them naturally healing over time without any effect. This is also why homeopathy still survives to this day.</p>
<p>As the rich and powerful have access to these exotic creatures, they are also seen as status symbols. And as medicines produced from these animals would have little to no effect, and also show a certain amount of divine power (the giraffe is said to resemble the qilin or chinese unicorn), they are written down by the scholars of the time as miracle cures.</p>
<p>As Asia's economy improved and industrialised in modern times, the people had a higher standard of living, and the things that were once only restricted to emperors, nobles and the extremely rich could now be bought by middle class people. This drives up demand, and therefore increases the hunting pressure on these animals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Traditional medicine has roots tracing back thousands of years and is largely unchanged.  It is generally based on crude pharmacology and various types of anatomy and physiology.  The science may not be 100%, but there is a scientific process of sorts and certified practitioners.  Folk medicine is an uneducated, cobbled together kind of medicine that is customized to area, problems, etc.</p>
<p>Traditional medicine in rural Asia is largely unchanged over the past 100 years.  Globalization has not done much more than change the way it's expressed to a more coherent and organized means.  Their beliefs and science behind it may be questionable, but we have similar issues in our medical practices, just expressed in different ways.</p>
<p>Folk medicine has changed radically with globalization.  The introduction of alien species has opened up a lot of exotic flavors to tired tropes for snake oil salesmen.  Imagine if you wanted to convince an impotent man that you were selling a cure for his ED.  You've been selling ground up oxen horns for hundreds of years.  But now you can sell someone elephant horns.  New!  Bigger!  Stronger!  Exotic!  Striking!  It's everything a salesman would want.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our body axes of symmetry are determined by two things: The orientation of the egg (which has only one axis of asymmetry, i.e. it has a top and bottom but no features determining front from back)   and the sperm entry point, which makes &quot;front and back&quot;. Because of this, early development happens in bilateral symmetry because of these two axes.   Further development is asymmetrical, I believe starting with the heart.</p>
<p>Everybody else is right about the evolutionary advantages, I believe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some things like legs and eyes are significantly more functional in a pair. Really more a single complete set than a pair. One leg is sort of useful but really movement is based around both legs functioning together. One eye works, but your binocular vision is improved greatly with two. Ears need to be able to hear and in directions and pinpoint sound locations. With only one you cant really pinpoint locations because your brain needs a second reference point to compare and determine the location. Other things are probably due to redunency as well increasing survival rates. If a trait or adaption increases your ability to survive, then you are more likely to reproduce and pass that trait along. If you get sick and kidney is not working fully or your nostril gets stuffed up you have a backup.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Your white blood cells are your soldiers, the virus is the enemy.  When you reach the stage where you feel good except for the cough and sniffles, congratulations, your immune system has won!  But, like any bloody battle, there is a lot of cleanup involved.  So, your body flushes out the corpses and shrapnel with mucus.  When you cough and blow your nose, the battle-debris-filled mucus leaves the battlefield of your body to be properly disposed of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the very beginning, the cold virus has found a home in your throat or nose and your body's defenses against are limited.  Because your body hasn't yet been trained to tag the virus for disposal, it's operating with a degree of camouflage and infects cells and begins to replicate quickly.  You'll get irritation around the site and you'll have a sore, inflamed throat.</p>
<p>Then your body starts to kick into gear and begins the immune response.  You might run a fever as your body overclocks your immune system and tries to make it too warm for invaders.  Types of white blood cells start to analyse the virus and develop antibodies, or basically tags that get stuck to the virus that scream 'kill me'.  More powerful, specialized immune cells join the war.  You're swelling around the infected site in response to damage and to deliver more resources to the fight.  You're generating mucus to slow infection, manage inflammation and help to expel the virus from your body.</p>
<p>The virus is desperately replicating and has hit its peak numbers, and has spread from the initial site to other areas of your respiratory tract.  Your immune system has it tagged though and is annihilating it in massive numbers.  Your white blood cells, of which you make a solid billion a day, are still sprinting to the fight.</p>
<p>Over the next few days, your immune system gets the upper hand and the virus dwindles.  The body turns to cleanup mode, coughing out residual gunk and slowly ticking down inflammation.</p>
<p>Some of those antibody blueprints stick around, protecting you if that particular viral infection tries again.  Unfortunately there are tons of viruses and virus variants hanging around, so chances are it'll all start over again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The common cold is also caused by a virus instead of a bacteria and viral infections tend to travel around. So first you may get a sore throat, then as your body clears that area the virus may travel to your sinuses giving you a feeling of congestion around your eyes and nose, and then finally the virus may travel down into your lungs giving you a cough. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>In 3-phase AC you have three wires each &quot;out of phase&quot; by 120 degrees, or staggered by 1/3 of a full period; this phase shift is possible because each wire carries AC with the same frequency (commonly 60 hz or 50 hz).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>AC isn't so much the electrons themselves wiggling/vibrating differently, but rather the charge fluctuating at 60 hz as it leaves the generator.  This is directly proportional to the speed that the generator turns, which is usually 60 / second X 60 seconds / minute = 3600 rpm.  If you have just 2 coils on your stator, then you'll have just one source of alternating current (1 phase); one coil for positive would occupy 180 degrees and the one for neg occupying the other 180.  If you can squeeze in 6 coils to the stator, then you'll will have 60 degrees cover by each stator which will make each complete phase 120 degrees apart making it 3 separate phases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>3-phase is &quot;only&quot; three lots of single-phase spaced equally apart (120 degrees out-of-phase) to provide a very consistent power delivery, per /r/hollaverga's comment.</p>
<p>I don't know if it's the main reason but it is beneficial for large rotating machines as you can create a smooth, powerful, and importantly a <em>rotating</em> field with 3-phase motors which makes them perform better than an equivalent single-phase type. Depending which way you connect the wires the motor WILL run one direction or the other, which is not the case for single-phase.</p>
<p>Bonus trivia: 2-phase is/was a thing some places, a friend knows a farmer with a very old 2-phase machine but we've no idea what the thinking was behind it.</p>
