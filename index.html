		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, most of these responses are not getting at the root of the question. </p>
<p>The short answer is no. No mammal comes close. </p>
<p>The trait that you are talking about is generally referred to as <em>vocal learning</em>, particularly vocal production learning or the ability to modify vocalizations in a meaningful way. We know of three families of birds (<a href="https://youtu.be/POiLhy3nfWQ" target="_blank">oscine</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/ULzJc8CLeVA" target="_blank">songbirds</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/p0E1Wny5kCk" target="_blank">parrots</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/wkUokgJx3Tw" target="_blank">hummingbirds</a> ) and five families of mammals (humans, <a href="https://youtu.be/hnVAv77gEqo" target="_blank">dolphins</a> /<a href="https://youtu.be/7Xr9BYhlceA" target="_blank">whales</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/O3n_3XH5-A4" target="_blank">bats</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/qHR__ugsNBg" target="_blank">seals</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/0bI0Hh4jozc" target="_blank">elephants</a> ) that have this ability in the current measurable form. This largely is noted by an ability to learn and modulate vocal patterns from external sources (mimicking parent sounds) and the absence of that ability with deafness or isolation. As well, these animals share generally convergent brain circuitry in cortical regions to regulate this behavior - interesting on its own but outside the scope of this question. </p>
<p>Primates have been studied very extensively over the past several decades and while there are occasionally some papers that talk about slight modifications to one call or another, there is no comparison in their abilities to say a dolphin or a sparrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/3lsF83rHKFc" target="_blank">Vervet monkeys</a>  are often cited for their vocal abilities, but this is categorized as vocal <em>usage</em> learning - taking innate vocal calls and assigning meaning to them. They might have the cognitive substrates for the kind of communication humans have, but are not equipped to put that into any meaningful vocal capacity. </p>
<p>This is not to say that there aren’t other vocal learning species out there. It’s not an easy criteria to study in the wild, and it’s been proposed that it is not an all or nothing trait, instead falling along a continuum. For instance, <a href="https://youtu.be/wVQVw478Rh4" target="_blank">lab mice</a> have only recently(?!) been shown to regulate their calls in different contexts and have a <em>very</em> sparse but parallel brain circuitry to vocal learning species. From these findings, there’s no telling what might pop up in other species like dogs, hippos, or marmosets. </p>
<p>This is kind of my area of expertise so if anyone has any other questions I’m happy to answer them.  :)</p>

<p>Note: Lyre birds in the wild are not likely to mimic some of the things that the bird in that video does, apparently that particular program used a couple of captive lyre birds which learned to mimic things they heard in captivity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll give this my best shot - my daughter has a Port Wine Stain (PWS) birthmark that runs from her eyes up over the top of her head following what I believe are called the trigeminal nerves, and ending on her lower neck behind her ears. This is a result of Sturge-Weber Syndrome, a rare disease. Basically, there was a mutation in utero in a gene called GNAQ - causing a protein that, instead of switching off, remained switched on, leading to excessive growth of blood vessels under her skin and on the surface of her brain.</p>
<p>I'm sure I screwed that up somehow.</p>
<p>Not everyone who has a PWS birthmark gets Sturge-Weber, and even fewer have the birthmark bilaterally (both sides of her head/brain. So she is a rare case than most.</p>
<p>Because of the extra blood vessels, areas of her brain that should receive a normal amount of blood flow are receiving more, and other areas not enough. Parts of her brain have already atrophied (died) and she will most likely experience more as she grows up. This leads to a high likelihood that she will experience seizures and stroke-like episodes, although she has been fortunate to have had no seizures we are aware of this far. We also take her for laser treatments on the birthmark - it was a deep purple color at birth and kind of looked like she was wearing a superhero mask. After two years of treatments you can hardly notice the difference between areas where the birthmark was and the surrounding skin. She just has cute pink eyebrows :-)</p>
<p>Having known nothing of birthmarks 2.5 years ago, I feel like I've come a pretty long way in a short time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Our cells produce a dark pigment known as melanin, some cells produce too much melanin at a particular spot. (This is a birth mark). </p>

It's a type of vascular birthmark that's often associated with brain and spinal conditions like spinal bifida and other conditions like <a href="https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/what-is-eds/" target="_blank">Ehlers Danlos Syndrome</a>. I have <a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Chiari-Malformation-Fact-Sheet" target="_blank">Chiari Malformation</a> and Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. Like many others with Chiari and EDS, I have a stork bite on my neck. Its caused by stretching of the blood vessels while the fetus is developing, and can keep growing past the birth date. Unfortunately, they're not sure exactly why or how the correlation exists, but I think it's an interesting subject.</p>
<p>White birthmarks are due to a lack of melanin, in the spot where the mark is visible. I have two white birthmarks that do not tan like the rest of my body. So if I've been in the sun, they're more noticeable because of the contrast of tanned and white skin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

So what you're asking is &quot;what is the voltage between Earth and space&quot; or &quot;what is the difference in electric potential&quot;, but not &quot;what is the difference in voltage&quot;.</p>
<p>The answer is around zero. If Earth had a positive potential, the free hydrogen nuclei (protons) in the upper atmosphere would just fly off until it's zero. If it was negative, the protons and helium nuclei from solar wind would fly towards us until it's zero.</p>
<p><del>In related news, the capacitance of Earth is around four farads. That is, the amount of charge needed to change our voltage relative to space by one volt is ~four coulombs.</del> [edit] unreliable source, should not have mentioned that</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a beauty of a question, because your title asks one thing, but the body asks another.</p>
<p>I'll cover both!</p>
<p>Space has no voltage, but it does have magnetic fields which can induce voltages into conductors. It also has charged particles, which vary in intensity, which can also induce a voltage. If you're a satellite or interplanetary spacecraft hit by a solar proton event, you'll find yourself charged to millions of volts.</p>
<p>A tether between space and the ground has less to consider. It is wholly within Earth's magnetic field, but does not move within it (assuming a geostationary tether), so won't generate anything from magnetism other than that generated from the field itself moving, which is quite small. </p>
<p>The ionosphere is one of the outer parts of Earth's atmosphere and, as the name suggests, ionized. As movement of ions if the definition of an electric current, they can also produce a voltage. A grounded tether would definitely discharge the ionosphere to some extent.</p>
<p>However - You said ungrounded! This means the tether is what electrical engineers call &quot;floating&quot; and will simply try to assume the potential of whatever is the strongest influence. Without giving it some kind of path to ground (e.g. through a useful load!), it'll produce no useful work at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It actually depends on a few factors. What you are cutting, the type of knife or blade you are using, and other things like temperature of the knife and the object you are cutting.</p>
<p>The biggest determiner, is the thing you are cutting. Soft, malleable things like loaves of bread, or very loose meat, don't cut well with a sharp edge because you don't have enough tension in the material you are cutting to press against the blade and create an even cutting surface. Tomatoes and Bread are excellent examples of this. Only the sharpest of sharp knives can even hope to cut cleanly and evenly through some breads and most tomatoes without issue or mushing.</p>
<p>Serated blades, seek to change this by adding in the serrations, tips and points that act to tear and have sharp points that press into what you are cutting and pull small sections, like a saw blade and tear bits and pieces instead of cutting cleanly and straight through.</p>
<p>Very, Very hard things also have the same problem, like bone or frozen foods. The ice makes the object to cut so hard and dense, that a sharp knife is almost useless. A serrated knife on the other hand, can cut by ripping and tearing its way through the object where a standard blade could never perform.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since pressure is measured as a force divided by area ( P = F/A), having serated teeth means the pressure that used to be divided by the whole length of the blade in contact of the material being cut, the pressure gets quite a bit higher, and so more likely to cut through.</p>
<p>There is also the case of cutting thin but strong materials (like leather), then serated teeth do a slightly different thing. The tooth now snags on the material, and instead of only cutting with the downwards force of the blade, you now add the force coming from your hands back and forth action.</p>
<p>Most cases have the the effects added together to some degree, but those are the basic principles of serated teeth. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The radiation isn't really that dangerous and the blanket for your body is more of a precaution than anything. Also radiation is more of a danger for quickly dividing cells in your body such as the bone marrow, small intestines, and the testes/ovaries. Protecting the gastrointestinal organs from radiation exposure is much more useful than cells which divide very slowly such as in the brain, spinal cord, and muscles. The sensitivity of tissues to radiation is called &quot;radiosensitivity&quot; and for the brain it is quite low.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m super bummed out by a lot of these responses. I make a living working on sound for films, and while I’m mostly a Dialogue Editor and Foley artist, I have mixed and study under/work with the best guy in my state. Yes, we mix for theaters, and in surround, but that’s because the mix will translate to other devices and stereo a lot easier (in theory, although admittedly it’s...tricky to say the least). We were both trained to mix dialogue FIRST, and base everything else around that. Louds can be loud, and softs can be soft, but what’s being spoken is the most important thing (even whispering). Not everyone follows this rule, and it sucks. As far as blaming the Mixer, especially on anything that was released in theaters first (so anything out of Hollywood), trust me: you absolutely do not get to that level without being a master of your craft. Those people definitely know what they’re doing. But it’s not 100% up to the Mixer. It’s not his/her Film, it’s the Directors. And even big-name Directors are usually at the mercy of the studio paying for the film. I’ve heard of several mixers who had to do things they were absolutely not proud of, but that’s because the person writing the paycheck wanted it differently or thought they knew better. Also, there is, and probably will never be, a universal lossless audio codec, and most of the lossy codecs nowadays tragically alter the mix of a film. Even playing back on an expensive 7.1 home theater system won’t be the original mix, let alone headphones from a phone. We just haven’t figured out how to truly translate from the original mix to smaller and smaller devices. There are many reasons for this all-too-common complaint, and as a professional, please believe there are those of us actively trying to make a difference.
TL;DR - Please don’t blame the Mixer. We’re doing our best, and there are a ton of factors that go into this complaint, and yes, we are wildly aware that there is a problem. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Motion picture audio engineer here. The short version is that every device is tuned differently and you can’t possibly mix for all of them.  See, the mix that we do on a stage is meant for theatrical release. This mix meets certain standards for audio levels and dynamic range set by standards bodies like SMPTE, AMPAS, etc. A slightly different mix is done for distribution, but again meeting certain standards. For TV we may do a big 5.1 mix and a “near field” mix for smaller TVs. Both of these mixes conform to a certain standard. The problem is that these standards are based on a certain listening environment.  If you have a home theatre that is capable of reproducing 20Hz-20KHz then you may hear a nice even mix. But listen to the same thing on your shitty iPhone speakers that can’t reproduce any low end, and its going to sound much more hollow. That iPhone may have piercing highs and muffled mids too because the absence of certain frequencies can really highlight others. This applies equally to you whether you’re on a mobile device or your TVs built-in speakers</p>
<p>There’s also the fact that an audio mix is meant to be heard stationary, from a constant position. Sound level is logarithmic, so moving that iPhone closer and further from you is going to have a significant effect on the quality of sound you hear in that mix. Couple that with acoustics in the room that can significantly affect frequencies and you start to see hw our modern viewing habits are an auditory nightmare. Frankly, it’s a testament to some of these standards that things actually sounds as good as they do across all kinds of different devices.</p>
<p>EDIT: so people are now asking about a couple of other things. Let me clarify standards and talk about dynamic range. First, standards don’t mean that explosions are only X decibels louder than dialogue. How all that stuff is in proportion to each other is called a mix. That part is all artistic license in the part of the mixer. What we do is calibrate the mix rooms daily to ensure that everything is being mixed to the same consistent baseline. This ensures that from one scene to the next there is consistency. There are walls other things to consider, like broadcast TV has different standards because there are/were bandwidth limitations in the signals so certain things might need to be compressed differently. And for those that are talking about the commercials being louder than the program, there is legislation governing this (granted, like most legislation its written by people that don’t know what they’re talking about so it sucks).</p>
<p>Dynamic range (go google it) is the idea that some sounds are soft and some are loud. There is a range of volumes in real life and the goal of the mixer is to reproduce that closely enough that it sounds convincing. That range in a movie or show is a little more compressed that real life, but you need to keep some spread to convince our brains and not distract the viewer. We could reproduce the entire mix with a range of only 20dB, but that would suck. What most people don’t realize is that sound is subconsciously perceived as good, bad, realistic, fake, etc. A good mix with realistic sounds is something that most people will not notice, but a bad mix will be instantly noticeable and distracting. </p>
<p>So why don’t they mix it for computer speakers and iPhones even if it’s intended for Netflix? Because audiophiles like me will still pull it up on my roku with 5.1 sound to watch it properly. Frankly, they do it so people like me will give them academy awards and they can charge more for the next film they work on.</p>
<p>If the whisper to explosion ratio is really bug in you that much then a) get your ears checked, or b) get a compressor for your viewing system to compress the dynamic range and make everything the same level.  But don’t complain when it sounds bad in a different way. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's complicated. NAB has a guide regarding the technicalities of this but, in short, it all comes down to cubic feet of room space. When you mix in a bigger space you have to push more cubic feet of air and the nature of dynamics changes. A lot of films and tv shows are mixed on dub stages that have a cubic air space that's much bigger than a typical home residence. This explains why the dialogue is so low and things get so loud. When you move from a big space to a small space the dynamics are exaggerated. Low volume content becomes too low and loud content gets too loud. Dialogue becomes too dynamic. The reverse is also true. I remember a doc I mixed in a smallish room and it was run at a theatre and it was much more dynamic. They complained it wasn't loud enough in the big room even though they sat in the small room and said it sounded fine. So, mixes in smaller spaces don't translate well to bigger space and mixes that happen in bigger spaces don't translate well to smaller spaces. I actually warned them about this and they didn't listen to me (ironically) when I said the mix wouldn't translate to a larger space. I don't think they wanted to spend the money on renting out a big theatre just for their little doc.   </p>
<p>I end by saying this: I think there needs to be a technology that allows you to adjust a mix based upon the cubic feet in your space. Basically, it's a smart mix. The stage the show / film is mixed on enters in their cubic feet and optimal listening position and it compares that with your home setup and adjusts for optimal listening. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Bodyhair has a much lower liftetime than head hair, thats why eyebrowns are shorter.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the hair location (sort of what type of follicle it is). Hairs grow in three stages: anagen, catagen and telogen. First, hair cells grow and divide in the anagen phase, where the hair follicle itself begins to enlarge and grow deeper into the scalp or skin and comes in contact with nutrient supply. Head hair naturally remains in the anagen phase for an extended period of time, up to several years, and this is where it's location dependent. Hair on your arms, however, will move on to the catagen phase in a matter of weeks. This is when the hair stops growing and transitions to the dormant telogen phase. Telogen phase is where the hair stops lengthening, the bulb becomes more detached, and eventually falls out naturally through shedding or external trauma such as pulling. As hair follicles will have different lifespans in different areas of the body - dependent locally on certain hormone signaling and protein expression - and will grow at different rates/remain dormant for different amounts of time/fall out at different rates. Hope this is helpful.  :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body hair is subject to abrasions, especially your limbs, more so when compared to your eyebrows and the hair on your head. That is why the hair on your body is more thin at the ends compared to the root, contributing to its shorter length along with the different hair types(why people think shaving makes hair grow back thicker). To expand on what others are saying about the different types of hair, humans have three types of hair: languo, vellus, and terminal (which, after puberty,  can be subdivided into axillary hair). Languo is a little thicker than peach fuzz that all babies have, vellus is your normal peach fuzz, terminal hair is your thicker body hair (head, body, and pubes), and axillary(google will tell you it is body hair, sorta correct because it is a terminal hair, but it’s different) is your armpit and pubes. Axillary is different than normal terminal hair because all hair is very sensitive to testosterone, so it’s a bit different in the growth cycle.  Testosterone regulates hair growth by affecting the follicle and how it can produce the different types of hair. These follicle changes affect the growth phases of hair, producing different reactions. The result is changes in hair growth, or lack thereof, occurring over time, as the growth cycle of hair can take as long as 7 years to complete. What has baffled researchers for decades is how can a hormone like androgen cause some hair’s growth to be inhibited in one area of the body, while helping it in others? This paradox appears to be gene related. That is why men are more “hairy” than women, due to their much higher testosterone excretion. </p>
<p>Now that we have the hair types down, let’s expand on the growth cycle. 3 phases: anagen, catagen, and telogen. Anagen is the growth phase where 80-85 percent of hair spends during the growth cycle. Catagen is the transition phase, and telogen is when the hair is dead and called a “club hair” and can easily fall out. How long your hair is depends on how long is spends in the anagen phase. The hairs on your arms or legs differ in the anagen phase than the hairs on your head, which is why your arm hair doesn’t grow 10 inches long without trimming.  Everyone has differing lengths of the anagen period for a given body part compared to other people.  For the hair on your head, the average length of the anagen phase is about 2-7 years.  For your arms, legs, eyebrows, etc., this phase normally lasts just 30-45 days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Dopamine makes us feel good, but Endorphins regulate our well being (isnt that the same?). Also every chemical is being described as &quot;responsible for happiness&quot;.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, you do not need a degree to understand this in a general sense!</p>
<p>Referring to them as &quot;happiness chemicals&quot; is a vast oversimplifcation.  For these molecules, they're simply <em>neutral signaling mechanisms</em>.  They play particular roles, in certain species, in certain tissues/systems, simply because of the way those species/systems have adapted to make use of them.  In humans/mammals, many of those systems are related to what we call &quot;happiness.&quot;</p>
<p>You're absolutely right that the same chemical may have totally different effects in each circuit.  Here's the short of it:</p>
<p><strong>Dopamine</strong> is a neurotransmitter.  When a neuron is &quot;active,&quot; neurotransmitters get released, typically at the synapse (the place where that neuron &quot;connects&quot; to another).  In doing so, it communicates information from one neuron to another.  I wouldn't think of dopamine as &quot;making us feel good.&quot;  This idea, however, comes from its involvement in circuits important for reward-motivated behavior.  Essentially, it's one of many signalling mechanisms that make a <em>circuit</em> that facilitates <em>learning</em> work.  It's used in <em>a lot</em> of different circuits, though, including but not limited to those important for other aspects of cognition, and for motor function.</p>
<p>While dopamine is a single neurotransmitter, <strong>endorphins</strong> (from <em>endo</em>genous mor<em>phin</em>e, meaning morphine-like things that occur normally in us) are an entire class of things which can be described as neuropeptides and peptide hormones.</p>
<p>Neuropeptides are themselves a type of neurotransmitter, but we generally don't refer to them as such.  They're generally packaged separately from neurotransmitters like dopamine, although they often coexist in neurons with classical neurotransmitters.  </p>
<p>Hormones are also signaling molecules -- they're just transported in body fluids, like blood.  They can act on a wide variety of tissues, not just other neurons in close proximity.</p>
<p><strong>Serotonin</strong>, like dopamine, is a neurotransmitter.  In addition to what it does in the nervous system, it actually plays a major role in the mammalian intestine, where it's part of the signaling mechanisms that keep stuff flowing (literally).</p>
<p><strong>Oxytocin</strong>, like the endorphins, is a neuropeptide and peptide hormone.  It can serve many different functions, but <em>in mammals</em>, it's been shown to play a role in the molecular/cellular/tissue-level mechanisms underlying childbirth, reproduction, and social bonding.</p>
<p>I want to reiterate that these are largely just molecules used to signal between cells and tissues.  In different species they can do very, very, different things.  For example, serotonin is thought to play roles in the circuits controlling aggression and hiding behavior in crayfish!  These molecules can play all these different roles <em>because</em> they don't have any inherent bias toward certain emotions, behaviors, or what have you.</p>
<p>There is an important difference between them that's worth pointing out!  <strong>Serotonin and Dopamine</strong> are organic molecules which are assembled in the body -- they're biosynthesized from other material, and are identical between species.  They're relatively simple in structure, and we can represent them like <a href="https://www.leafscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/marijuana-serotonin-what-is.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> and <a href="https://www.leafscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/marijuana-and-dopamine-2.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
<p>The neuropeptides -- like <strong>endorphins and Oxytocin</strong> -- are proteins.  Each organism has genes which code for them, and they're different between species.  Proteins are made up of chains of amino acids, which <em>themselves</em> can be represented rather simply, like <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Amino_Acids.svg" target="_blank">this</a>.  Even though mammalian Oxytocin is very small for a protein (being made up of 9 amino acids), <a href="http://static.newworldencyclopedia.org/thumb/0/0f/Oxytocin.jpg/250px-Oxytocin.jpg" target="_blank">it's still much larger than a single serotonin molecule!</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you have a misunderstanding of how neurotransmitters work. A neurotransmitter is a molecule released by one neuron and received by another. That's it. Nowhere in the definition of a neurotransmitter does function come into account.</p>
<p>Lets talk dopamine. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter heavily implicated in reward pathways, specifically, in stimulus-response pathways. If you do something and you get positive feedback for it, you see an increase in dopamine release. However, dopamine also inhibits the release of prolactin, which stimulates lactation in females. This doesn't have anything to do with happiness-- it's just another thing that dopamine does.</p>
<p>Serotonin plays in a role in depression, but it doesn't make you happy. For example, giving SSRIs to non-depressed people won't make them happier at all. Depression is thought to be caused by an inability of the body to successfully deal with higher-than-normal cortisol levels, and serotonin helps with that. Many mechanisms that regulate sleep and awareness also rely on serotonin. Destroying these pathways, or destroying the sertonin producing neurons in them causes cats to fall into permanent comas.</p>
<p>Oxytocin is a neurohormone that's released that likely facilitates social bonding. It is released after sex, when two strangers meet for the first time, when an infant suckles a mother. However, it is also released when an in-utero infant pressures the uterus, triggering uterine contractions.</p>
<p>So the difference between dopamine and serotonin and oxytocin is not like the difference between a pencil and a pen and a marker. While all three play a <strong>role</strong> in happiness and mood, that is not their only, or even primary, function.</p>
<p>Take a look at <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Dopamine.svg" target="_blank">dopamine</a>, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Serotonin-2D-skeletal.svg" target="_blank">serotonin</a>, and <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Oxytocin_with_labels.png" target="_blank">oxytocin</a>. They're completely different molecules with completely different functions, all of which just happen to play some role in regulating mood. So because of that, I think it is unfair to label them as &quot;happiness chemicals&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer...yes, if you really want to understand neurobiology you do need a degree, or more accurately, the training, access to materials (journal articles/experts), and immersion in the research environment, that typically goes with pursuing a degree. </p>
<p>That being said, one of the important things to keep in mind especially with systems as complex and the brain, is that in order to be able to have descriptive terms for everything, scientist need to be extremely careful with what specific terms mean, and this is often lost in translation when material is made more publicly available. </p>
<p>Here's a review on the subject: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/neurotransmitters" target="_blank">Endogenous Neurotransmitters</a></p>
<p>In general terms, </p>
<p>Dopamine is often described as the feel good molecule, but its a reaction to something like tasting something sweet that triggers dopamine release and the spike in feeling good. Its like a pet owner saying &quot;good boy&quot; to their dog. It reinforces the behavior by producing a positive response/sensation.</p>
<p>Endorphins produce a sense of well being which is more like increasing our ability to ignore every other signal that says &quot;hey stupid, this isn't fun, stop it&quot; </p>
<p>Still, what these chemical (neurotransmitters) do, depends a lot on which specific type of neuron is secreting it, and on to which other type of neuron or cell. It depends on how much is being released, how often, and in combination with what other neurotransmitters. It depends on what other transmitters were released previously.</p>
