At this site there is a localization of the plastic deformation, and can become the location of a macro-scale fracture if the load continues. The crazies aren’t technically voids or cracks, they actually have 50-55% free space by volume. The rest of the volume in the area is the polymer molecules that have been aligned by the force applied. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

But little national press because it's just not as big of a news story when a few hundred thousand acres of national forest burns vs literal suburbs burning.</p>

The west coast in general is tinder box due to drought.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fire is natural in California forests. California forests evolved with fire to remove dead and diseased trees, clean up litter, and control tree density. Early explorers said the Sierra Nevada is always on fire (Fremont). Native California people set fires if the forest was too thick to travel through, and to control dense patches of poison oak. </p>
<p>In the late 19th century, European forest managers were brought in. European forests are small, heavily managed, and resemble tree farms. In the mind of these foresters, fire was verboten. All fires were put out immediately. However California forests are usually on super steep slopes, as California is a fairly young tectonically active terrain. So all the litter cleanup that happens in European forests did not happen in California.</p>
<p>Fast forward 150 years and you have California forests vastly overgrown, dead and diseased trees abound. Wildlife is increasingly limited as the dense tree canopy shades the forest floor, little grows on the ground, and there is little for the grazing animals hence they are in decline.</p>
<p>Frequent fires kill the smaller trees keeping the taller pines dominant. A dense cover favors fir trees which according to one biologist's lecture I attended last year consume more water (pines go dormant when they can't reach water), and actually raise the temperature of the forest about 1.5C by reducing stream flow.</p>
<p>Then when you do have an accidental fire, the heavy fuel load of litter, and the dead branches of the diseased and younger trees take the fire to the canopy, and you can't fight that kind of fire.</p>
<p>So the real problem is forest mismanagement. But it doesn't stop there. The forest managers set as many prescribed fires as they can. However air quality managers and cultural factors provide more control over forest managers. So it comes down to bad politics.</p>
<p>There was a devastating fire in a residential neighborhood in South Lake Tahoe a few years back. The resulting investigations revealed there were seventy some odd nature preserving NGOs (Non Government Organizations) that could level fines on home owners for removing pine needle litter, removing trees, or other reasonable fire safety measures ... not one of these NGOs were responsible for the devastating fire caused by the mismanagement of their rule.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The early universe is opaque, so there's a limit to how far you can see before you hit this opaque region. The furthest we can see is back to the point in time when the universe got cool enough and thin enough that it transitioned from opaque to transparent. We're looking back in time with distance, so what we see is a sort of wall behind everything, a kind of <em>background</em> to the universe.</p>
<p>In this background we see the surface of the very hot gas that our portion of the universe evolved from. Over time, the light from this background has been redshifted down to microwaves. So this is the <em>cosmic microwave background</em>, and we have lots of maps of it.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that telescopes don't see &quot;far&quot;, they're just good at capturing lots of light to see dim things, and at magnifying things to see things at higher resolution. So a low resolution telescope will still get the light from lots of distant galaxies, it just won't resolve them well enough to see them as individual galaxies - they'll just all get muddled up together. And a small telescope just won't capture many photons from these galaxies at all.</p>
<p>But the cosmic microwave background comes from all directions, so it's not too hard to detect. Newer instruments have just been able to map it in higher precision.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's import to also understand the galaxies 13.2 Billion ly away that the Hubble can/has imaged, are now a lot further away: on the order of 32-34 Billion ly away, due to the expansion of the universe in the 13.2 billion years since the light left those galaxies. There is a point already out there where all the light that was ever going to get here from there has already arrived. The expansion of the universe has now made those things so far away, that its light will no longer reach earth. It may be, the light of the very first stars to shine in the universe through opaque clouds of gas in the early universe falls into this category. The light of the big bang, if it existed, probably also falls into this category: it is outside the light cone of what it is possible to see from where we are. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The issue isn’t our ability to see that far away, it’s that the space between us and there is getting bigger. Not just that things are moving away, there is physically more space.</p>
<p>For instance, our observable universe’s border isn’t as far back as time goes, it’s the distance at which all the space between us and there is expanding faster than light, so no light from beyond that point will ever reach us. It’s like trying to run south on an infinitely long northbound train. You will never make it back to the station. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The system we currently use to understand calories includes but has trouble accounting for digestion itself using energy. Imagine if I ate a given amount of ice cream, which is very fast to digest, vs. eating something like raw kale, which takes a while to digest. The amount of energy you get from either one is going also include energy used in the process of breaking it down into useful energy. </p>
<p>Back in 2001, researchers fed adorable little mice cooked vs. uncooked meat and sweet potatoes, and at the end of 40 days there was sufficient evidence to conclude that the cooked food provided more usable energy. The furry little white mice fed raw meat and sweet potatoes needed their digestive systems to work longer and harder to extract usable nutrients from their food. </p>
<p>Cooking, thus, is the beginning of the digestive process, delegating some of the work to things like an oven or a stovetop or a microwave. The energy is still expended in digesting, but it's energy from electricity or the burning of gas or the inductive heating of magnets instead of our body's biological processes. </p>
<p>Also, mice can sometimes sneeze, and it's every bit as high-pitched as you're imagining right now. I mention this not because it has bearing on the topic at hand, but because I think most people enjoy cute things, including 5 year olds. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you cook food, water tends to evaporate. The cooked weight and raw weight of the same portion is therefore different. The amount of macronutrients and therefore energy content of the food has not changed, only the overall mass.</p>
<p>100g of raw beef might lose enough water to end up as something like 85g for the same caloric value because it lost 15% of its mass from water evaporation.</p>
<p>When you read a nutrition label, the portion sizes tend to be standardised. you might compare 100g of raw beef with 100g of cooked beef and see that the cooked portion has more calories.</p>
<p>Although cooking might avail more calories in some foods, the way we calculate the energy value of a food doesn't necessarily take this into account. A Calorie is the amount of energy required to raise 1L of water by 1 degree Celsius. Foods are literally burned in a device called a bomb calorimeter, which is like a large oven with water surrounding it. It measures how much the surrounding water is heated by completely burning the food in the chamber. This method does not therefore account for assimilation and utilisation of nutrients, which will vary between individuals and cooking methods to a small extent.</p>
<p>edit: the everyday use of the term &quot;calorie&quot; is actually a kilocalorie, or Calorie with a capital C. A calorie is a smaller unit of measurement that raises 1g of water by 1 degree.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5: The cooking process is like unwrapping a sweet (piece of candy). If you eat a sweet with the wrapper on, your body will not digest it, but if you remove the wrapper you expose the sugar inside for your body to digest. Some sweets come with a hard outer shell which your body can digest, but it has to spend a lot of energy doing so. Cooking can help soften or break down that shell, saving your body from having to do the hard work itself.</p>
<hr />
<p>Obviously, it's correct that the amount of calories per gram increases when you remove water, as others have stated. However, that doesn't really address the question properly. The real reason why cooking food can increase the digestible calories is that cooking helps break down the food, which both makes more calories available and saves your body from spending calories digesting the food. Some things cannot be digested by humans, like cellulose, but if you cook the food you can break open the cellulose and release the nutrients inside which are digestible. This is why we cook potatoes. Also, cooking breaks nutrients down which saves your body from having to do so. This results in a net gain of calories by cutting the amount spent on digestion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Camp Fire already has 29 known fatalities and with 200+ people missing that number is probably going to get a lot worse.  But that tells you something.   Usually wildfire fatalities are a lot lower.   If you look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_California_wildfires" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_California_wildfires</a> you'll notice that only 10 wildfires in CA history have had more than 10 fatalities, and of those, 2 were so high because firefighters got killed.</p>
<p><em>Usually</em> most people evacuate and avoid being killed, with a few either taking unwise chances or just getting unlucky. </p>
<p>So why was the Paradise fire so deadly?  First, the timeline.  The fire started at 6:33 AM on Thursday.  By around 6:45 firemen were on the scene of the ignition and observed a rapidly spreading blaze.  Shortly after, an evacuation was called for Paradise.  So we are talking about an evacuation notice coming out at around 7am.  The fire spread incredibly rapidly, driven by hot, dry winds coming down from the mountains at speeds of 40mph.  At one point it was burning the equivalent of 80 football fields every minute.  It didn't take it long at all to cover the 7-8 miles to Paradise.  It was right on top of the town shortly after the evacuation notice went out, and some people would have missed it because they didn't, eg, happen to have the news on.  </p>
<p>At that point, we come to problem number two, which is that Paradise is kind of a remote community without a lot of ways in and out of town.  There's one main road and a few others. Everyone in town was trying to leave by these roads.  And of course the fire was coming towards the roads too.  It took people hours to make a drive of a few minutes thanks to bumper to bumper traffic, stalled cars on the road, etc.  And Paradise had a lot of old people who may not have even been able to drive.  At any rate there were a bunch of people who had to try to drive through the fire, and they didn't all make it.     </p>
<p>Finally, you've got the issue that the blaze swept right <em>through</em> town.  This is relatively rare.  Usually wildfires stay in the woods, but this has been changing lately.  Higher winds, dryer falls, more movement of people out of urban areas into the borders of woods, it all increases the odds of fires getting into inhabited areas.  And Paradise in particular used to have a lot of tree cover in town.  Lots of oak and deciduous trees with the leaves dry but still on because it hasn't rained yet.  Firefighters had to give up on stopping the blaze and just had to try to get people out as best they could.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People think that wildfires burn one tree down before setting fire to the next and so forth. However as soon as a tree catches fire the next one is about to get engulfed in the flames as well. So if a fire reaches a dry forest it can set the entire fores on fire in a matter of seconds. You might be able to drive in front of the fire if you have a smooth clear road. However if you are driving on the backroads or there is turns in the road or if the road does not lead directly away from the fire then you might have to drive like a rally driver to be able to get away from it. And all the time you are getting hit with the smoke and heat from the fire making it hard for you to breathe. A lot of people die in forest fires after their cars break down due to all the smoke and heat.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So people have the idea that they have time to evacuate. Even if the fire is just over the next hill it can move slowly and might not look like it will reach them. However the wind can change, the fire reaches somewhere with lots of dry tinder, going uphill, etc. So a fire that moves at yards per hour towards you can suddenly get up to 20 miles an hour as the crow flies. Unless you have a very carefully planned exit route that gets you quickly away from the fire you will not be able to outrun it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

We can feel the flames from inside the car. We’re terrified but don’t know if it’s best to turn around or keep going. Before we can make the decision we drive out the other end of the fire and all is safe and clear.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This confusion comes from a misunderstanding about what compiling is.</p>
<p>These days we commonly say we don't work in bits or machine code. That isn't exactly true. People who work in hardware do work in bits when they're developing a new kind of circuit.</p>
<p>When microprocessors were first created everybody worked with bits. Flip this to on and then that causes this and you can flip these to represent a number and flip this switch to move it into a special register and picked up by the clock.</p>
<p>At first that worked fine. Kind of the way you don't need labels for the 20 or so light switches in your house. But after a while they wanted a) more complicated systems and b) people with less experience to be able to contribute.</p>
<p>So that's when early forms of what we would call assembly language came on. It abstracted all the little switches away into a smaller set of instructions like move data, add data, subtract data etc.</p>
<p>Pretty soon after that things got too complicated again so some people who found themselves writing the same combinations and order of these instructions sought to abstract these hundreds of lines of simple instructions into a single line instruction. So they wrote a program that would take a program of five lines in this new langauge and convert it into the hundreds of lines of assembly language.</p>
<p>This has happened multiple times over and each time the compiler/interpreter etc is written by people who <em>can</em> write in the lower level language the compiler produces but would rather save themselves the keystrokes.</p>
<p>EDIT: My source is 22 years of programming, 18 years of software engineering. These days I leverage some of the lessons and motivations for developing compilers into developing custom tooling for other software engineers in mid to large scale organizations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Early on in the history of computing, programs would be written as a sequence of operations in assembly language, which basically means they would be written in terms of actual physical operations for the computer architecture to perform, e.g. copy this numeric value to that memory location.</p>
<p>That's obviously very time consuming and difficult, and it means that programs have to be rewritten for each new type of processor that you run them on. So to make it easier, higher level languages that are more human readable were created, with commands that basically work as shortcuts for all the repetitive number-juggling required in assembly language. So you have to write a compiler in assembly language, which doesn't require compiling. </p>
<p>It's interesting that you ask &quot;did <strong>he</strong> compile it at all&quot;, since the first person to write a compiler was actually a woman, Grace Hopper :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Please bear with the first bit of this as I establish a framework understanding.</p>
<p>Machines execute machine code. Compilers do <em>not</em> compile directly to machine code. They compile the code into to <em>assembly</em> which is then <em>assembled</em> into machine code.</p>
<p>Machine code has two parts, <del>zero and one</del> operands (what to do and where (registers) to do it*) and data. Depending on the number of 'bits' the machine is, these can all have varying lengths of bits.</p>
<p>Now that we understand what machine code is and how it's structured, let's look at what assembly code is.</p>
<p>Assembly code is <em>human readable machine code</em>.</p>
<p>We (humans) give the operands <em>mnemonics</em> (names) and logically divide this into three parts to make things easier to remember for us. No matter what, the same operand mnemonic will <em>always</em> turn into the same sequence of binary. </p>
<p>So assembly let's us turn a 'line' of binary from</p>
<pre><code>010011110101000001010010 010100100100010101000111 01000100010000010101010001000001</code></pre>
<p>Into</p>
<pre><code>OPR REG, DATA</code></pre>
<p>So now we know what assembly is, and how it's written. How does a machine turn assembly into machine code?</p>
<p>Why with an assembler of course! Usually assemblers are 'programmed' on paper, by hand writing the assembly you would normally type to later be run through an assembler. The next step is. . . Translating the assembly of your assembler to binary yourself! Hooray how exciting!</p>
<p>Even still we keep it a bit more human readable than direct binary we use a system called hexadecimal to represent binary. A symbol of hex is four bits, and is as follows.</p>
<pre><code>0 0000
1 0001
2 0010
3 0011
 ...
F 1111</code></pre>
<p>Once you have your program translated from assembly to hex, you queue the program in a hex editor. A hex editor is a peripheral attached to the machine which stores the binary of your program which you enter using hex, and sends it to be executed once you are finished.</p>
<p>So, now we understand how we get machines to do anything. Let's see how we can reach the ability to compile a compiler.</p>
<p>1) Hand write an assembler in assembly/hex.</p>
<p>2) Enter your assembler into a machine with a hex editor</p>
<p>3) Write your compiler in assembly and assemble it.</p>
<p>4) Write your compiler in the language your compiler compiles.</p>
<p>5) Assemble the compiler.</p>
<p>6) GOTO 4</p>
<p>That's how you get a basic compiler. </p>
<p>Fun fact: A compiler written in the language it compiles is called a <em>self-hosting compiler</em>.</p>

But I am getting confused by the claims of the contractive states breaking the limit, and yet a reinterpretation of definitions of precision and resolution seems to validate that <em>repetitive</em> measurements can <em>never be broken</em> due to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Relation between the Standard Deviations of the positions of the free mass at the first and the second measurements, which equals to the SQL. But the review paper I read itself said, after pointing the the HUP=SQL, that the SQL is not a fundamental limit. How?</p>
<p>Does the Uncertainty relation mean that the SQL can never be broken? Shouldn't it? Does it mean no one's working on breaking it? All the above paragraph was from papers from before 2000s, so what's the consensus now?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to answer without more context or without knowing the papers you're actually reading, but maybe it's <em>squeezing</em>?</p>
<p>The Heisenberg inequality is typically the product of the variances of two conjugated variables or quadratures, e.g. ΔX²ΔY²≥ħ²/4. Naively, one would assume that ΔX²≥ħ/2 and ΔY²≥ħ/2 in this case. </p>
<p>However, it's possible that one of the variance is smaller than that <em>naive</em> limit, as long as the other is greater, e.g.  ΔX²=ħ/4 and ΔY²=ħ. In this case, we say that X is <em>squeezed</em> (because ΔX²&lt;ħ/2); i.e. that it <em>appears</em> to beat the quantum limit. In reality, no real limit is violated because ΔX²ΔY²≥ħ²/4 holds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A partial answer:</p>
<p>The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is a statistical relation between incompatible operators.  It will never be violated, ever, because it‘s trivially true.  (It can be proven from pure mathematics with only the definition of variance + the Schwartz inequality.)</p>
<p>A contractive state is a special state whose position’s variance decreases for a time.  However, σ_x <em> σ_p &gt; ħ/2 for all contractive states, always.  In fact, a contractive state’s σ_x </em> σ_p approaches ħ/2 in the limit the state approaches the usual minimum-uncertainty wave packet.</p>
<p>The “standard quantum limit” in that context is just the x-uncertainty of a wave packet (i.e. not the exact same thing as the uncertainty principle).  The “standard quantum limit” elsewhere can differ, and can refer more to the state’s preparation and a particular observable.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any follow-up questions or clarifications.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Here are some more recent papers that I found useful in studying the quantum limits to measurement, which may or may not be useful to you.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.7.021008" target="_blank"><a href="https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.7.021008" target="_blank">https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.7.021008</a></a>  This is an experimental paper, but it has a detailed description of some of the different quantum limits people talk about. I think the description is general enough to apply to the free mass limit (take the mechanical resonance frequency to zero)</li>
<li><a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/10/9/095010/meta" target="_blank"><a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/10/9/095010/meta" target="_blank">http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/10/9/095010/meta</a></a> This one proposes a scheme for avoiding the measurement backaction by measuring &quot;stroboscopically.&quot; That might be similar to what you're talking about regarding &quot;repetitive&quot; measurement, although they're not in the free mass limit again. This scheme has also been tested experimentally, but for technical reasons, it hasn't beaten the SQL yet. Here are some experiments:

<li>Lecocq, Clark, et al, PRX 2015</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Also check out &quot;Introduction to quantum noise, measurement, and amplification,&quot; in Reviews of Modern Physics from 2010. Lot's of general information, and they do discuss the SQL.</li>

E.g., if you passed by a junkie on the sidewalk doing drugs, you wouldn't <em>have</em> to report it to the police (I'm guessing almost everyone would just keep on walking). There are some exceptions to that (mandated reporters) but they typically don't involve drug use.</p>
<p>When the documentary is released, the police could choose to open an investigation based on what they saw. If things were really serious, theoretically they could subpoena the documentary-maker the provide them with names or raw video footage or testimony or whatever.</p>
<p>It would be a big hassle and I'm guessing most police departments wouldn't really give a shit if some random person did drugs in a documentary, unless there were more serious crimes involved.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am in Ecuador and today I saw a striking hummingbird while hiking around 4300 meters. I didn't know hummingbirds could live that high up, so I did a bit of investigating and found this article about a species discovered only 6 weeks ago and the coloration, size, habitat and range all match perfectly to what I saw. Who knows if I actually saw this hummingbird or a more common species- i could not find any others that resembled my sighting- but that's neither here nor there. It got me thinking: suppose I did see this species, if I had seen it 6 months ago I apparently would've been the first person to ever see it. But at the same time, I would never have known that it was a new species. How do biologists make this determination? Is there a comprehensive list somewhere of every known hummingbird species? Do biologists just go down the list and if they can eliminate every known species then they know they've discovered a new one? How exactly does this sort of thing work?</p>
<p>Here is the article in question, by the way- including a picture of the species in question. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-species-high-altitude-hummingbird-may-already-be-trouble" target="_blank">https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-species-high-altitude-hummingbird-may-already-be-trouble</a> </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A biologist will usually study one animal at a time. So in the case of hummingbirds, a biologist may spend their whole lives researching and studying different hummingbird species (usually they will focus on a particular geographical area like North America) until they become an expert on all things hummingbird. At that point they would notice details in different species that the average observer wouldn't, such as markings or unique behaviors.</p>
<p>Once they have found what they think is a new species it becomes a measuring game. They will capture one and look at it more closely, measure wing span, study anatomy, or even testing DNA with previously discovered species are just a few ways.</p>
<p>Then it gets into the question of where does a new species begin and another one end. What usually determines a new species is its inability to mate with others. But even that gets sketchy when it comes to interbreeding animals like how a Donkeys and horse's offspring is a mule. So they can breed but they are definitely not the same species.</p>
<p>Speciation is more of a spectrum rather than a specific definition so here's an image that shows the progression. Sorry about the quality.

Basically any time a new species is defined, one member is set aside as a type specimin that all other members are compared to.  If an animal is sufficiently different, then a type specimin is proposed, an article is written and argued over, and if it successfully makes it through that process, then it's a new species. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There really is no specific way of doing it. Classically things were done with morphology, but that can be very deceiving. Males and females are often quite different, so they either need to be observed mating, or looked at genetically. </p>
<p>Ability to mate and produce fertile offspring is also used but, as others have pointed out, sometimes different species are able to do that (though it's rare that the offspring are fertile). Another problem with mating as a distinction is that it can be really difficult to replicate the conditions in which animals will mate. I work primarily with marine invertebrates and I can tell you that it's almost impossible to get some animals to mate or spawn in captivity, let alone raise the offspring to maturity so they can be mated and <em>those</em> offspring raised to maturity. Then of course there's plants where hybrids can still produce fertile offspring (most citrus fruits in the store are not naturally occurring). Then there's the vast majority of life on Earth that is single celled and reproduces asexually. </p>
<p>That leaves us with DNA. Every species has unique DNA right? But so does every individual. So we are left with the question of &quot;How different do they need to be?&quot; Until fairly recently, scientists used &quot;barcode&quot; genes that are typically the same within species, but differ between them. The problem is that some groups (I know about sea anemones personally, but there are others) have very similar DNA to the point that very distinct species would be considered the same by that method alone. Now we can sequence entire genomes very quickly. So quickly, in fact, that the problem is processing the information. Modern sequencers can generate a terabyte of data every 15 minutes! Then we have to figure out what's from the specimen, what's a mutation or virus modification, what is a normal modification, what came from bacteria living in and on the individual, etc. Then we still have the question of &quot;How different is different enough?&quot;</p>
<p>Finally there's discussion, debate, publication, more debate, and 20 years of old timers refusing to acknowledge the change because they've been calling it something different since grad school.</p>
<p>tl:dr - We have a lot of tools, techniques, and experience that still amount to &quot;we'll know a new species when we see it.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
