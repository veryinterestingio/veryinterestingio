So the short answer is our handwriting is influenced by a number of things; hand strength, finger dexterity/fine motor control (how well you move your fingers in small movements), our vision, and our core strength (mainly our posture aka how we sit while writing). So since everyone doesn’t have the same strength or skill in these categories it’ll vary from person to person. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A contributing factor is that we probably haven't synthesised the most stable isotopes of many superheavy elements. The higher the atomic number, the greater the neutron/proton ratio required for stability, and since superheavy elements are synthesised by fusing two lighter ones together it's hard to get enough neutrons.</p>
<p>For example the first isotope of Copernicium (element 112) synthesised, in 1996, was Cn-277 with a half-life of under a millisecond. A few years later Cn-285 was synthesised and that has a half-life of about 30 seconds. Still very short in human terms, but many thousands of times more stable than the first isotope discovered.</p>
<p>It's likely the same will apply for the newest elements discovered, and indeed unconfirmed results indicate this. Even in the predicted &quot;island of stability&quot; half-lifes are still likely to be minutes at best though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's just how the periodic table is set out usually. There are various other ways of setting it out <a href="https://thumbnails-visually.netdna-ssl.com/ThePeriodicCircle_503d6c999bf9f.jpg" target="_blank">including some</a> that <a href="https://www.johnpratt.com/atomic/images/round/circular_periodic_table.jpg" target="_blank">are circular</a>.</p>
<p>The layout comes from solutions to an equation in Quantum Mechanics; as you go down the table (so allow for more electron energy levels) the possible number of electrons goes up quite a bit. It is 2 at the lowest energy level, then 8 for the next, then 18, then 32, then 50 (although I don't think anyone has managed to get something with that many electrons).</p>
<p>There's a diagram demonstrating this (kind of) <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Electron_subshels_(triangles\).png" target="_blank">here</a>; as you allow for more electron layers, you can start adding in a lot more electrons.</p>
<p>Although as with most things it is a bit more complicated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the periodic table is a bit like a pyramid. There are more elements every other row.</p>
<ul>
<li>The 1st row has only 2.</li>
<li>The 2nd and 3rd row have 8 each.</li>
<li>The 4th and 5th row have 18 each.</li>
<li>The 6th and 7th row have 32 each.</li>
</ul>
<p>If it weren't for things braking down and being to radioactive and shotlive to allow for chemistry, this trend would be expected to continue for further elements.</p>
<p>The explanation is a bit iffy, but the ELI5 version is that chemistry is determined by the way electrons are distributed around an atom. Similar distribution of electrons mean similar chemical behavior.</p>
<p>The columns in the periodic table represent electrons in a similar configuration. </p>
<p>The name of the element is determined by the number of protons it has in its core. Since protons are positively charged and electrons are negatively charged, an atom that is neither missing or has too many electrons has exactly as many electrons as it has protons.</p>
<p>The protons are all in the core and don't matter much for chemistry but the electrons surrounding the core are the important bit.</p>
<p>Electrons are arranged in rather complicated ways, but one metaphor is that they orbit the core in shells. The innermost and smaller shells get filled up first and what is left in the outermost shells does the chemistry bit.</p>
<p>The most inner shell has only room for two electrons. Which is why the first row only has room for hydrogen and helium.</p>
<p>An element with 3 or more protons and therefore three or more electrons needs to star putting them in shells further out.</p>
<p>As you can imagine from the metaphor a large shell further out has more room than a smaller inner shell, so it takes more electrons to fill it up.</p>
<p>This is why the rows in the table keep getting bigger.</p>
<p>All elements that a have a full outer shell. have no reason to borrow electrons from anywhere and thus don't really bond with anything much and are chemical unreactive. This is why all the elements on the rightmost column act more or less the same and are grouped together as noble gases.</p>
<p>All elements that are missing just one electron to be full, fall into the group right next to it. Theses halogens react in similar manner with other elements, producing salts with metal and so on.</p>
<p>Of course since each additional shell has more room the higher you go the more variation there can be.</p>
<p>This is only a very ELI5 version the real stuff is far more complicated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The modern periodic table is actually quite an amazing predictor for chemical properties of matter, but we didn't know about all of the elements as it was being conceived, and nature doesn't have a symmetric, visually-pleasing balance of elements. The rows to which you are referring actually slide up and squeeze into the main table, but drawing it that way isn't helpful. </p>
<p>It's very similar to a globe or a cartesian map, especially if you think of the United States: we often display maps of the US with both Alaska and Hawaii in the lower left corner, cut out and pasted into the Pacific Ocean so we can just fit all of the states in a nice little rectangle. If you really look into all of the families and periods, pay attention to electron cloud properties, properties of metals, etc, the table really is laid out brilliantly. </p>
<p>It does take a bit of effort to understand how to interpret it all, but if you are interested in learning chemistry, or even just taking a high-school or college-level class, it is worth studying. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In normal “healthy” people, meaning they have no serious underlying diseases present, those sharp twinges are most likely due to muscle spasm or somatic dysfunction, which is a fancy word for saying that your body is a little out of whack in a certain area (tight muscles, fibrosis of tissues, lack of blood flow, etc). These events are common in pretty much everyone and occur mostly due to normal daily activities. How much pain these things cause in each person is variable, from totally unnoticeable to moderately painful. Some people will even mistake chest pain for a heart attack when really they are just having pectoral muscle spasms. </p>
<p>In people with underlying disease (obesity, heart failure, diabetes, significant atherosclerosis) these pains are more likely to be associated with a more serious issue like vessel spasms, blood clot/embolus, narrowing/hardening of the arteries, etc. </p>
<p>If these types of pains happen infrequently like every couple weeks then it’s nothing to worry about. If you notice pains with normal daily activity or especially upon exertion it’s probably a more serious issue </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>as to why nails grow how they normally do, it's because of how they're built. all of the nail you can see is dead. it's created under the skin by a strip of material called the &quot;root&quot;, and it's a C shaped channel that build the nail. the nail grows forward because that's the direction the material is drawn. </p>
<p>a common cause of ingrown nails is bad footwear. the pressure pushes the skin and nail together until the obvious happens. trauma is another cause. something damages the toe and the nail gets messed up. as are infections in the toe, as infections can swell tissues. however, a large number of cases have no known cause. </p>
<p>common speculation among professionals is that it's a minor defect in the nail's root. if the channel is misshapen, then the nail can push in the wrong direction. not unlike a defective printer. the rest of your anatomy has some ability to compensate, the Perionychium (the skin around your nail) can callous up and that added hardness can potentially push the nail into proper shape, but sometimes it can't. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off, that can happen. I once got an ingrown toenail so bad they had to literally slice my toenail in half, and removed the entire left side. It took 20 years to properly regrow back.</p>
<p>That said, think about how the nail grows. It doesn’t grow from the tip outwards. It grows under your skin and then pushes out like a soft serve yogurt machine.  (Just ask any woman who painted her nails two weeks ago and hasn’t touched them up.)</p>
<p>As the nail grows and gets pushed out, it follows the path of callouses you’ve built up over the years, and that guides the nail outwards.</p>
<p>Sometimes though, the nail falls off the track like a pair of skis trying to carve through ice.  Maybe the left ski follows the callous path and it ok, but the right ski pops out and goes all wonky....that’s when it starts to really dig into the callous and becomes painful. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Get a good pair of scissors and cut your nail into a wedge, the thinner part of the wedge being the front edge of your toenail, you have to pry the scissor edge down the side of it and snip, push it forward a little more, snip, keep going until it comes off.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because there’s already water in the ground. If you were to dig down beside the lake you’d hit saturated dirt at the same level as the surface of the lake. The level at which this occurs is the “water table.” Water flows under ground and levels out so if you dig a hole and keep the hole open, it will fill with water up to the water table. We call those holes “wells.”  </p>
<p>Of course nature is more complicated than that simple model, but that’s basically it. Rivers can lose water to the surrounding ground as they flow or gain water. Perched aquifers above the surrounding water table can occur when there are pockets of impermeable material holding water like a bowl. Those impermeable layers are called “aquatards.” If there is a lot of rain in an area the ground above the water table can be permanently saturated, but the water is moving downward to the water table. Coasts are more complicated when tides are involved. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The soil under and around many, many lakes is <em>fully saturated</em>, either <a href="https://cdn.britannica.com/s:300x300/88/62688-004-4754D9C9.jpg" target="_blank">like the light blue volume here</a>, or more <a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.grafika24.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Groundwater-in-the-underground.jpg?ssl=1" target="_blank">like this</a>, where we see some combination of rather impermeable layers under the lake.  In both cases, there is appreciable connection between the groundwater and the lake water... edit... such that net flow between these two systems isn't going to bring down the lake level any time soon.</p>
<p>Speaking of net flow, I like <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/u5835e/u5835e0d.gif" target="_blank">this image because it shows groundwater feeding a reservoir, which then feeds the same groundwater volume, which then feeds a river.</a>  </p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nathan_Waltham/publication/281003853/figure/fig1/AS:613853142454274@1523365402881/Schematic-cross-section-of-North-Stradbroke-Island-showing-the-location-of-Blue-Lake-as.png" target="_blank">when a lake is <em>immediately</em> underlain by an especially impermeable layer -- such as clay -- there might be roughly zero groundwater connection to the lake</a>.  These two little lakes are perched -- their inputs derive from rain, snow, and from overland flow, but not from the groundwater that feeds many other lakes.  Their only output is evaporation and maybe a little stream (which is probably matched by an input stream).</p>
<p>And as others have said, even if a lake is underlain by an enormous quantity of very porous material that <em>isn't</em> fully saturated, as long as the lake's inflow (e.g., rain and streams) matches what it loses (from its bottom and/or from an outlet stream and evaporation), the lake level will be rather steady.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

You’ve saturated the soil and the rate at which water is entering exceeds the rate at which it can drain away.  That’s basically how lakes form.  Water enters from rain, glaciers melting, streams, etc, and that exceeds the rate at which water can saturate the soil beneath it and water starts to pool until it overflows down some other stream</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Water table information has already been given, but a slight expansion is to talk about the <em>rate</em> of flow. Imagine sucking through a straw the size of the gap between soil particles. It’s slow.</p>
<p>In general, the coarser the substrate (e.g. sand 10^-1 m/s) the quicker it drains. The finer, the slower (e.g. clay talking like 10^-7 to 10^-10 m/s). Clay is interesting because it’s formed of lots of small plates. This makes it difficult for flow to go down, and much easier for it to move sideways (imagine how milk splashes off your cornflakes).</p>
<p>But before i go off on any more tangents, in response to your question: if no more precipitation occurred, then lakes would, via evaporation, surface water flow (rivers) and groundwater flow (through soil/rock) completely dry out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Movie spoilers often happen after you’ve heard preliminary info about the movie. Hearing the spoiler connects the dots in your head, it’s like dropping something onto a single strand of spiderweb or onto a full net—the net connects in more ways and the spoiler “sticks” better. </p>
<p>Plus, you’re pissed that someone spoiled it for you. That emotional reaction helps you remember. </p>
<p>Compare this to, “There’s a budget meeting next Tuesday and we need those numbers by Monday.”  Good luck remembering that dry data—unless of course it fills you with fear, of course. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Darkness is not the only thing that changes on a 24-hour cycle. Close to the surface (up to 1 m depth), temperature also fluctuates on the same cycle. So worms <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/113/48/E7837" target="_blank">definitely</a> have a circadian rythm.</p>
<p>Subterranean animals such as mole rats that live deeper than that also exhibit circadian rythms.</p>
<p>As for deep see creatures, some seem to exhibit bicircadian rythm based on the lunar cycle, and others a circadian rythm based on the patterns of their prey.</p>
<p>As caves are the most arrythmic environments on the planet, cave animals exhibit the least circadian patterns of all, but some vestiges seem to be there.</p>

The circadian rhythm is controlled by a protein and it gets feedback from various sensory systems to adjust the the time cycle. The time cycle set by the rhythm varies between animals, in humans it's about 26 hours naturally, but it recieves input from our sensory systems. For instance, there are specialized photoreceptors in our eyes that feedforward directly to the part of our brain that controls the circadian rhythm. As far as neuroscientists know, every living thing has some sort of &quot;sleep&quot; cycle independent of specific sensory inputs, regulated by a protein.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot less variables with a bolt action. They are simple and strong, and that makes for less ‘play’ in the action. Semi autos use a gas system, rechamber based on recoil and basically have more moving parts, which is more that can throw off the ballistics of a given shot. They are also often constructed to be more portable, and light. Which results in shorter barrel length, which means reduced accuracy. (I seem to have been informed this is more to do with velocity than ballistics, fair enough)</p>
<p>Most modern sniper rifles also use more powerful rounds than ‘traditional’ rifle cartridges, such as 338 lapua magnum. These rounds offer superior ballistics, but are impractical for use in a marksman rifle, on the move with an infantry section.</p>
<p>That said, it’s not always true. A modern marksman rifle is produced to a higher standard of accuracy than a bolt action sniper rifle from 100 years ago. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, bolt actions are more accurate than semi-automatic actions because of the movement of the bolt carrier when firing. In a bolt action, the firing system is static except for the firing pin; nothing moves until after the shot has been fired and the operator decides to cycle the action and eject the spent casing and force another round into battery (put a round into the chamber.) In a semi-automatic platform, immediate after the firing pin hits the primer  and fires the round, the exhaust from the explosion forces the action backwards, ejecting the round, and then automatically loading the next. It's this forced movement that makes them a little less reliable accuracy-wise, since at a long distance, even a fraction of a millimeter (a super tiny amount) can end up as a significant difference. Thinking using your imagination, imagine GIGANTIC scissors that are 1000 meters long. if you close them, you might only move the handle a few inches on your end, but on the far end, because of the lever it's created, the tip will move much farther for the same amount of movement (and faster, too). That's it generally. The lateral movement of the action pulls the barrel, creating relatively minor movements that translate into larger differences downrange. Also, depending on the need, this might not actually be a big deal. Most modern military snipers, even in elite squads, use semi-automatic platforms. To them, in a scenario where it really matters, the difference between the two isn't significant enough to warrant sacrificing speed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For some reason no one here knows how to talk to a five year old.</p>
<p>The accuracy of a gun has a lot to do with staying still while the bullet is leaving the barrel. </p>
<p>A Simi automatic gun has the bolt moving all the time inside the gun while the bullet is going through the barrel. Since it has to bring a new bullet into the chamber. </p>
<p>A bolt action rifle does not do anything after the trigger is pulled. So the gun will move that little bit less while shooting. So that way the gun is a little bit more accurate. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Accuracy depend on repeatability so if you point the gun in the exact same direction and the air in front of it is the same the bullet hold hit the same point.</p>
<p>Bolt action is just a barrel and a bolt you lock in place. All stay the same way when  from the time you fire the bullet until it have left the gun and the shooter cycle the weapon. </p>
<p>A semi-auto need a way to cycle the gun with the energy from that is released when you fire it. </p>
<p>Common way are  blowback that is using motion of the cartridge case backwards to the bolt or gas-operated  by having a small hole in the barrel and let gas out and use the pressure. There are many variant and other to do that to.</p>
<p>The problem is to do that in a way so the speed of the bulles it the same time and that the exact moment that part start to move and the vibration that introduce is the same for each shoot. It is not the case that the bullet have left the barrel before part start to move and gas is released so uneven operation will reduce accuracy.</p>
<p>So you have you will have all  the same problem for accuracy as a blot action have and you add problem by requiring the cycling mechanism to work the same each time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hydrogen cyanide is not very caustic and would definitely not eat your upper jaw away. The way it kills you is similar to Carbon monoxide: Cyanide (after losing a positively charged hydrogen) will outcompete oxygen for its binding sites in hemoglobin (blood) and myglobin (e.g. muscle).</p>
<p>Which means that either you won't get any oxygen to your muscle and brain even if you breathe - or, even if you did it still couldn't be used there. So you would, in a way, suffocate despite breathing. Also, the stuff smells like almond.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
