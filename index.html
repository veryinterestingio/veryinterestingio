		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a condition know as <em>situs inversus</em>, and about 1 person in 10,000 has it.</p>
<p>If all the organs are reversed, the body functions completely normally, and it is not unusual for it to go undetected.  The main issue is making sure medical providers know about it, especially in an emergency.</p>
<p>In some cases, the reversal is imperfect, and this can lead to a number of health problems, with the most common being cardiac problems.  Also, situs inversus can be caused by Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia, which results in improperly formed cilia in the body.  Other symptoms include sinus and lung problems, and male infertility.  These are chronic conditions you would have already had.</p>
<p>Finally, situs inversus can complicate organ transplants involving asymmetric organs like the liver or heart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Make sure this is added to your medical notes wherever you go. A lot of your organs are asymmetric so it's important to know. Make sure your SO knows so they can tell medics if you can't. A medical bracelet is a good idea. Also fill in the emergency medical details on your phone. It's a good idea to have a rough idea where your appendix should now be, just in case you get weird stabbing pains in your stomach. </p>
<p>I had fun with this when I was a kid. I was a subject for the finals at a medical school. I remember the colour draining from one young soon-to-be doctors face when he couldn't hear my heart, then the look of relief when he tried the other side. Lol. Got paid too, about £15 I think. Which was a lot in the early 90s. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I experimented with this after suffering blackouts on a regular basis over about a few months. I read that it was down to the blood alcohol level and at a certain point it interfered with long term memory. So I set out by restricting my calorie intake each Friday before going to the pub and drank 6 pints of budvar over approx 3 hours. </p>
<p>I restricted calories by skipping meals. Breakfast, lunch or dinner </p>
<p>3 meals in sequence = drunk no blackout </p>
<p>Breakfast and lunch = pretty hammered, no blackout</p>
<p>Breakfast = brown outs with a lingering memory of arguing at the Indian takeaway for a smoked sausage</p>
<p>Breakfast and dinner &amp; lunch and dinner = brown outs with little to report.</p>
<p>No meals = ruined. I apparently peed in the cupboard and argued with my own reflection in a mirror before taking the mirror off the wall and placing it in the bath.</p>
<p>Shortening the drinking time from 3 to 2 hours had a huge impact, pretty much without 3 meals i was blacking out. </p>
<p>I also repeated this in different establishments and dark indoor pubs seemed to have a impact, although not enough that I could make any conclusions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We sort of know: alcohol makes neurons in the hippocampus stop talking to each other properly, which prevents the formation (encoding) of longer-term memory, which means that by the next morning, you don't remember what happened the previous night. </p>
<p>Rapidly increasing BAC (like binge-drinking) seems to cause more memory problems. Some people are simply more susceptible to alcohol-related memory impairment than others, and no one is entirely sure why that is.</p>
<p>Be careful with black out-level drinking. Short-term, it can put you in dangerous situations. Long-term, it may not be very good for your brain's health.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>most of the explanations on here make total sense, although there's one thing I didn't see touched on that was part of my experience, that I've always wondered about.
for many years I drank as naturally as I breathed,  and I was able to ingest and sustain, what seems now to be a heinous amount of hard liquor or beer for a 19/20yr female of my size, (5'4&quot; and probably around 100lbs at the time,  if that) and for a good while i never blacked out,  like.. ever. not once! and I had a bad diet,  bad sleeping habits,  you name it.  but there was a certain night when it distinctly changed,  I got into, what was then,  the worse  fight I had ever been in, with my (then) SO. yelling at each other outside a gas station,  screaming after one another down a quiet neighborhood street at some horribly rude hour of the night,  definately post-midnight, bawling in someone's front yard,  strangers coming up and saying if things didn't lighten up they would get the police involved,  the whole nine yards, extremely dramatic bullshit,  totally unnecessary, totally embarassing, but hey,  everyone has at least ONE night where they act a complete fool in their lives... right? lol.
aaaaanywho,  that night I blacked out for the first time and after that I started to black out it seemed like every time my emotions would get even a little frazzled,  it always felt like that night, had like... been some subconscious tipping point where my brain said never again!  so, before- I was able to hold it together but afterwards, even if I was in a perfectly fine mood,  celebrating even, not a dark cloud in the metaphorical sky,  it wouldn't matter, once i passed the tipsy stage and proceeded into drunkenness,  i became an emotional mess and would black out almost like clockwork, (hence beginning the official stages of a definite spiral into a dark alcoholism period)
bbbbbut I'm just wondering if that's common? to have a said,  &quot;tipping point&quot;, or if that's just a mental health commonality pertaining to depression ect ect</p>
<p>and also- the inability to form long term memories is a logically sound explanation for most blackouters, but I'm also curious to it pertaining to if your mixing, let's say MDMA with alcohol,  cuz it was my experience, that I wouldn't black out or get drunk when I was rolling,  us that just a side effect or the drug,  some suppression of alcohol receptors cuz their too busy wanting to dance? lol,  I've always wondered about that.  ah to be young again... lol </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>our brains are hard wired to recognize human faces and eye contact. In fact, there's a whole part of your brain devoted specifically to that task, and people with damage to it can get something called face blindness. So human faces in your visual field get some special attention when it comes to how your brain processes the image in front of you, leading to quick attraction and notice.</p>
<p>For people you can't see, you might recognize their presence by some other means, such as sound or touch. Then when you turn, both you and their face-recognizing visual systems have a reasonable chance to result in spontaneous eye contact. This might fool you into thinking you &quot;sensed&quot; them looking at you.</p>
<p>Otherwise it is likely simply a matter of confirmation bias. You recall when you felt something &quot;odd&quot; and met someone's eyes, and forget when you just &quot;felt something odd&quot; and nothing happened. There's no real basis for a 'sense' that can detect eyes looking at you, eyes don't transmit anything unique that makes an impact on human skin. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From Earlier Thread - This answer seems helpful</p>
<p>In as ELI5 as I can: you can't, but you think you do. One of 4 things can happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone is looking at you, and you notice.</li>
<li>Someone is looking at you, and you don't notice.</li>
<li>Nobody is looking at you, and you notice.</li>
<li>Nobody is looking at you, and you don't notice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, the first one, you'll remember. You think &quot;why is Johnny looking at me? Has he been looking at me the whole time? That's kinda weird.&quot; The 2nd and the 4th, you cannot remember, since you didn't know it was happening. And the 3rd, well, you notice but you don't remember it, usually. Why would you? Nothing happened. People around you just doing their own thing.</p>
<p>Let's assume for fun each of these events are equally likely. Then some is looking at you (and you notice) 1 in every 4 times, on average. But it will feel like almost every time, because you don't bother remembering the times when someone isn't looking at you.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to offer a rare dissent, here, supported by absolutely no evidence.  So y'all are free to laugh at me until I am proven correct, years from now.</p>
<p>I offer the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Human hearing is more sensitive than many of us credit.  There was a recent example--predicted by William Gibson, by the way--of a blind person who learned to navigate a room by making bat-like clicking noises and learning to &quot;read&quot; the echoes.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check him out: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kish" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kish</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A possibly useful survival trait would be the ability to detect a silent predator by the change in <em>ambient</em> noise.  That's a change in the texture of other noises going on as something silently occludes a sound source or echo.  So our brains may retain this ability.  Furthermore, humans seem to have evolved from an early time in close proximity to a potentially useful ambient noise point-source--a smoldering fire.  Eyes burning a hole in your back, see--or rather, hear?  Does that turn of phrase go all the way back to the caves?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The shape of the human head might reflect ambient noise in different ways.  We have convex foreheads and, more to my point, we have two semi-concave eye sockets which, at a certain distance, might actually <em>focus</em> ambient noise.  When someone is looking directly at the back of your head (or more likely, from an angle that might help the subject to guess the position), their eye sockets may be focusing ambient sound directly at your <em>ears</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>Thus, when a person behind you turns to face you (as in staring), I think it's possible that some people may actually be able to <em>hear</em> a change in ambient noise that gives them the &quot;feeling of being watched.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Having said that, it would of course depend upon the shape of a person's face, the distance and position of that person, and it would be useless beyond a certain very short distance.</p>
<p>But it <em>might</em> explain some of the incidents that occur in enclosed places with a fair amount of ambient noise, like for example in waiting rooms or on the subway.  </p>
<p>And, in conclusion, I wish to credit Iron Maiden for the idea: <em>You walk through the subway, his eyes burn a hole in your back/ A footstep behind you he lunges prepared to attack</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So to the best of my knowledge, here is my question. The energy output by the sun is decreased by traveling theough the atmosphere. Would there be any benefit to using planes or balloons to collect the energy from the sun in power cells using solar panels above the majority of the atmosphere where it could be a higher output? Or, would the energy used to get them up there outweigh the difference from placing them on the earth's surface?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So this is actually currently being researched:
<a href="http://eas.caltech.edu/engenious/twelve/idea_flow" target="_blank">http://eas.caltech.edu/engenious/twelve/idea_flow</a></p>
<p>The idea is to launch arrays of space-based photovoltaic cells that would use microwave transmission to beam energy back to Earth. The big benefit of this type of approach is that it mitigates the variability of traditional solar panels. </p>
<p>In the short term cloud cover can cause variability in power output of solar cells and also the obvious issue of the day-night cycle. In the long term, the closer you are to the poles the more your sunlight varies throughout the year. What might be enough solar panels to get you through a 16 hour day in the Summer won't necessarily get you through an 8 hour day in the Winter.</p>
<p>A space-based solution could theoretically solve all of these problems by having several arrays of cells in geostationary orbit, such that some subset of them will be exposed to sunlight at all times. Since the energy could be beamed down in microwave spectrum, clouds etc. would not be as much of an issue as they are for visible light. </p>
<p>Obviously there are tons of technical issues to get this sort of thing working, but people are working on it!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The atmosphere is largely transparent to visible light, which is the range most conventional photovoltaics use. If located higher there could be a marginal increase (ignoring other factors at the moment) because there would be a few percent more of that light, however without the atmosphere blocking the more energetic wavelengths like UV the cells degrade requiring you to add thicker shielding/glass to mimic the effect of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Additionally photovoltaics have a reduced efficiency when hot, which is a concern when they are being hit by useless wavelengths (which normally the atmosphere blocks) that only heat the panels and contribute nothing to the actual generation of power while also having very little to no medium to assist in transferring that heat away</p>
<p>Finally you'd need a way to get that power from the panels back down to the ground, which could be done in a variety of ways, but realistically it's not practical from an engineering or cost perspective when you want the power at ground level in the first place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several reasons to why we like a song and most of them are cultural and have to do with our experience. I'll start with an example: a person from India who has mostly listened to ragas will find Beethovens 9th symphony very boring and flat and find all symphonies very simialar while a westerner will find ragas are a complicated series of rithms (bars can have a time signature of 17/8 and stuff like that) and eventually also find them all very alike. That's because the complexity of each kind of music es based in different parameters and all the dynamics of a certain music are only perceptible by a trained listener.</p>
<p>Also, the fact that you can associate certain sounds with emotions like happiness or melancholy or suspense, has to do just with what you have taught yourself by listening and associating sounds with images/situations/emotions all your life, but you are not born with this associations. </p>
<p>Also, a song as we know it was developed no more that 300 yeas ago. Medieval music was just one melody but the concept of armony, the understanding of the relations between music notes sounding at the same time was not part of western culture. Then the renascence brought polyphony, but as a series of melodies (contrapunctus) that don't produce &quot;chords&quot;, they produced a complex net of sound that to us sounds kind of flat because it has no harmonic direction, it goes nowhere cuz there is no one melody more important than the other. </p>
<p>With the arrival of the reform of the church and the baroque there was also a big aesthetic change, there was an intention to make music less complicated and get the message home (religious). So just then the concept of harmony/melody was created. This concept is what we call the tonal system. It was brought to perfection by the musicians of the classic period, exceptionally good example is Mozart, he just knew the system up and down.</p>
<p>Then later the romantics and expressionists created music that would go further than just sound good or happy or sad, they wanted to create music that would express complex emotions like anxiety or terror so they created a database of relationships between music and complex things that now is the basics for all the music you hear in movies, parts of star wars sound track is a rip off of Stravinsky's rite of spring. </p>
<p>So that said, nothing can be true about our preferences, but given that we like &quot;melodies&quot; over &quot;chords&quot; that create a &quot;harmony&quot; because of all our cultural background, I would suggest with not much certainty that the art of creating a good melody is in the ability of the composer to do good musical phrasing.</p>
<p>For example, if i writhe only short sentences you will find what I wrote rather boring and annoying. If I write big complex sentences you will also find it annoying. A good writing mixes short and long sentences. In music, phrasing is the ability to understand the timing for starting an idea or a melody and finishing it. </p>
<p>On the other hand, we have the tonal system deeeply learned in our heads, so we expect things to follow this aesthetic rules. Then again, if you only follow the rules and you just make music that doesn't challenge the listener then you get bored, but if you are all the time making a fool of the listener and never do what he expects then you will annoy everyone.</p>
<p>tl;dr: It is a cultural learning we are not born with the understanding of what is a song. In the end, a good melody has to do with good timing and the right playing with the listener expectations (in my opinion).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's dozens of reasons. Many of them have been mentioned, I'll take a shot at the ones that haven't been, or haven't been mentioned in detail:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>North Koreans don't have any marketable skills. East German unemployment is pretty high (compared to 0% under their old system), but most people were able to either keep their old jobs (particularly the working class), or could easily train to be as good at their careers as West Germans (in the case of sciences, history/sociology/anything that has a political bent to it, and so on). North Korea has some fantastic workers. They have doctors who can operate on you using an old beer bottle for an IV, and tools that were made before the Korean War even happened, and have a high chance of success. Their life expectancy is very high for a country roughly at the same economic and technological level as Ghana. But when those doctors enter a South Korean hospital, with state-of-the-art equipment and specialized drugs, nobody's going to need their beer bottle anymore. Those doctors will know next to nothing on how to work in a South Korean hospital, besides maybe a decent understanding of biology and anatomy. More likely, they're going to have to wait tables and sweep floors in that kind of society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anyone who knows anything in that country is probably a member of the elite and closely tied to the ruling family. If you get rid of all of them, put them in jail or so on, you'll have a serious case of Problem #1. Also the actual unification will be harder because they'll fight until they've got nothing left to shoot but their fingers, because they have everything to lose and nothing to gain. But if you keep them on to help in the transition, it's going to be a huge political mess, because the last thing the North wants is more of the same - we just sold them on the idea of joining the rich, high-tech South Koreans - and the political blowback from keeping the people who were putting their own people into death camps, running the same group of people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Getting to the unification is going to be a problem. The Kim family won't hold on to power forever, but they can hold on for a very long time. If we try to make peace with them (as we have before), they'll probably take us for a ride again, and then go back to business as usual, their regime a little more stable. But if we try to push them into a war they can't win... the South Korean capital happens to be just a few miles away from tons of North Korean artillery. West Germany couldn't've probably integrated the East by force for the same reason (West Berlin). The people in Seoul aren't going to be happy if their gung-ho leadership ends up getting the whole city shelled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whereas in Germany you had the Allied powers wipe the slate and set up the eventual reunification, Korean division was a bit more messy. North Korea used to be home to a lot of landowners, who made sure to take the deeds to the huge estates they owned with them when they escaped to South Korea or Japan. Many of their kids and grandkids still have those deeds locked in a safe somewhere, and since the South technically claims sovereignty over North Korea (they even have official governors of those provinces), there's nothing right now stopping them from marching North and demanding their huge tracts of land back from whatever group of farmers is currently there.</p>
</li>
<li>In East Germany and other Soviet bloc countries, the worst thing that could happen to you is that you could be shot. If life sucks enough, you might be willing to get shot if the alternative is a chance at a better life. Why live on suffering? Eventually, life began to get so bad throughout the communist bloc that tons of people looked at each other, realized life was pretty bad, and started to rebel. If your dad went to jail, you could lay low, but still have some hidden sympathies that would come out when the time is right. In the North, punishment is collective. If your grandpa gets caught listening to the wrong radio station and doesn't have the bribe money (about 4 years' worth of honest wages for that crime) or lives in a politically significant area like the capital, he's going to get sent to a concentration camp, but so will his close family and whoever lives with him, which probably includes you. If it's a serious crime (like escaping to the South), they'll probably follow it through to the letter, which means three generations of your family goes to camp. If the third generation doesn't exist, it'll be born there. Some North Koreans are born and die within the walls of a single concentration camp (look up Escape from Camp 14 for more on this). And if by the clemency of the Great Leader you're released back into your society, your songbun (for all intents and purposes, your caste) will be the lowest, &quot;hostile&quot; tier. So you'll be untouchable and your kids and grandkids will be untouchable, all because your grandpa tried to tune in to a South Korean soap opera. So that kind of pressure makes people very, very hesitant to stray from the system, whereas in East Germany, by the end, everyone was so wary of the government that you seemed suspicious if you were 100% enthusiastic about the ruling party or the socialist system.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, reunification between East and West Germany wasn’t a seamless as your title suggests. West German taxpayers have spent over $1.5 trillion to modernize the East since unification and it still lags behind the West in nearly every metric that matters: per capita GDP, household income, poverty, worker productivity, education, etcetera. Even at that though, East Germany was by far the most robust Soviet block economy and things could have been much worse had it not been.
East and West Germany voluntarily reunited and the chance of North Korea voluntarily and peacefully reuniting with the South are non-existent. Similarly, East Germans were well educated, relatively well skilled and still maintained contact with relatives and friends in the West (all be it heavily censored). North Koreans on the other hand are dirt poor and know nothing of the outside world other than what the government tells them.
As hard as East West German reunification was, it would be several generations and cost Trillions to bring North Korea anywhere near to the Souths level of development. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difference is that the 1989 Chinese Student Protests had just happened and the Soviet Union's leadership did not want that to happen in the Warsaw Pact.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1989 there were widespread student protests across China that culminated with a crackdown on the central protests in Tiananmen Square on 4 June 1989. Hundreds to thousands of students died, soldiers were attacked by mobs of civilians and even some PLA units, including most of the 116th Division, refused to advance on the students.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1989 various Communist bloc nations in Europe were allowing people to leave and go to NATO member states, it became something of a crisis and ultimately lead to the fall of the Inter-German border and the eventual unification of Germany.</p>
<p>There wasn't more violence because in July 1989 the Soviet leadership said that the Soviet Union wouldn't invade a Warsaw Pact ally that was liberalizing. With that assurance Hungary took down it's border walls in August 1989 and the whole thing unraveled by Christmas 1989 when the leaders of Romania were sentenced to death by their own people.</p>
<p>In North Korea there is no discussion about such liberalization because it is an absolute dictatorship in a way that no Communist country has ever had.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In common usage, the term special relativity is used more to refer  to things like time-dilation effects and such related to ones speed relative to the speed of light where general relativity is associated with the distortion of space-time in the vicinity of a gravitational source.</p>
<p>In reality, special relativity is just general relativity when there are no gravitational sources and the underlying spacetime &quot;texture&quot; (metric) is the simplest possible (i.e. special relativity is general relativity in the most boring possible spacetime structure).  Thus, &quot;special&quot; relativity is just a special limiting case of &quot;general&quot; relativity.</p>
<p>Historically, special relativity was developed first, by Einstein, in 1905 and then followed up with a more general framework in 1915ish.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>1/         Special relativity (SR) doesn't include gravity, whereas general relativity (GR) does.</p>
<p>2/         In SR, the laws of physics are the same for all inertial coordinate systems, that is those in which Newton's First Law of Motion is true.  In GR the laws of physics are the same in all coordinate systems, whether they are inertial or not.  So SR is a special case of GR.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Special relativity &quot;fixes&quot; Galilean relativity by preventing objects from travelling faster than the speed of light. This does not come from nothing, but is required by classical electrodynamics. It leads to spacetime as a four-dimensional Minkovski space replacing the old 1D time + 3D Euclidean space. This implies to things like the famous energy-mass equivalence.</p>
<p>General relativity is a theory of gravity that is consistent with special relativity, explaining gravity as a distortion of spacetime.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the comments here are focusing on the US, citing US-specific reasons as if this is a US-specific phenomenon when it isn't. Things are exactly the same here in the UK and Europe in general, so whilst I'm sure the reasons cited are contributing factors I think they omit to mention a major factor that is common to the entire developed world: the reduced value of labour. This is long so I'll make a TL;DR at the end.</p>
<p>Pre-ww1 as you have observed, for most families the husband worked for money whilst the wife was primarily concerned with keeping the house in order and caring for their children. The wife may help out with garden or farmwork in some capacity and she may even have some paid employment as a cook or a cleaner on some limited basis if there were older children at home who could care for their siblings but <em>in general</em> the vast majority of the family income was provided by the husband such that the wife didn't <em>have</em> to work. Lots of women did work of course, particularly in areas like service, but not <em>married</em> women. For most the choice was marriage <em>or</em> employment, not both.</p>
<p>This began to change in the interwar years since it had become acceptable for women to enter many professions. Nursing and teaching are perhaps the best examples of this; the reason we consider these as 'female' professions today is because they were among the first where women really came into the foreground and were allowed to do so because it fit with the gender role of caring and childrearing. Women still didn't <em>have</em> to work however, the war and the push for universal suffrage had simply made it both more necessary (due to the reduced workforce) and acceptable (due to changing attitudes) for them to do so. Ultimately however many women did just go back to being housewives for their husbands and that remained economically feasible since few women really had a 'career' still, more an occupation that could be engaged in if they were single or needed less at home due to having no children to care for.</p>
<p>WW2 brought another profound shift for all the same reasons: even further reductions to the workforce of a world which had still not recovered from the previous 'war to end all wars' (bear in mind some poor bastards fought in both) and a realisation of the fact that women actually <em>could</em> do all the same jobs as men saw them really enter the workforce proper for the first time. When the men came home, it was no longer simply a case of them going back to their old lives since many did not wish to, and even if they did the economics of the time made that challenging as decreased supply of goods (Europe continued rationing well into the 1950s) increased their value and thus more work was required to maintain standard of living.</p>
<p>Rather than adjusting back to the old economy which was calibrated for only 50% of the population working though, things were recalibrated to assume everyone was. Thus, once populations recovered in the 1960s you suddenly had 2 people for every job there had been initially. GDP was increased of course and more jobs were created but fundamentally the value of labour had been reduced - all of which was excellent for business but (as others have explained in their criticism of Raeganomics on this point) not so good for the population at large. This effect was only exacerbated then from the 1960s onwards with the push for gender equality, since for the first time women really started to have careers rather than just jobs and began to equal or even overtake men in many fields - so it wasn't even safe for men in highly technical fields anymore where previously they had largely escaped this effect and had continued to be able to act as sole provider as a result of women being unable to enter their sectors of the workforce. By the 1980s the effect was largely complete, with women not only <em>able</em> to have a career but actually <em>expected</em> and all but <em>required</em> to do so - the societal values had shifted but also the economics.</p>
<p>Over the same time period, we also had a massive increase in automation. Whereas you once needed hundreds of men to work a field, you could suddenly buy a machine to do their work for you. The wars brought huge technological advances on top of those of the late 1800s leading up to 1914, further reducing the value of labour before you even consider the effective doubling in supply. Everything is only worth what its purchaser is willing to pay, and this includes labour - it stands to reason if the value of a mans work is reduced because he must compete with a machine <em>and</em> suddenly twice as many other people are available to do the job instead of him then he will be forced to accept lower pay whilst his employer reaps the benefits of both a mechanised workforce <em>and</em> cheap human labour. This effect of automation is only likely to increase, as computers and AI continue to encroach on jobs which people currently occupy today - driving wages down and profits for companies up.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> - Machines and women entering the workforce increased the supply of labour and thus reduced its value, reducing wages and requiring everyone to work in order to maintain standard of living at pace with technological advancement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Got out of the Navy in Wash. D.C. in 1971 after 7 years as an electronics tech. Did a couple temp jobs in the Wash. DC area for a year and then went to San Jose (now called Silicon Valley) with a wife and a kid. No problem getting a decent high paid technician job paying $14K in 1973. Used the GI bill to buy a house for $28K with a mortgage less than rent on an apartment. Wife never worked (but is extremely frugal). I changed jobs whenever I heard about something more interesting that also paid more and we always seemed to have enough money even to buy a new car and motorcycle every few years. In 1985, sold the first house for $120K and bought new house for $150K keeping the same monthly payment making my cost of housing much lower than renters or first time buyers. Later I cashed in some stock options and bought a rental house with a small negative cashflow, sold it three years later for a profit and bought another house that had a positive cashflow. Finished college getting an EE using the GI bill. Career advanced, taking the most interesting and best paying job. I even took months off between jobs traveling in Asia. Eventually I aged out of the market and sold everything and retired living on social security and investments. </p>
<p>Nothing like that could happen today. I lived in the golden age of employment in technology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>WARNING: long historical analysis in broad strokes, that will rile people up with reactionary emotional responses and down-votes follows...</p>
<p>Wages and costs were once in parity. The line on the graphs for worst, median, and best salary were basically the same shape as the line for cost to buy a home, cost to buy a car, cost to raise a kid, and so on.</p>
<p>Then a particular and peculiar force took over the economy. People who'd read Ayn Rand (and similar nonsense) in the sixties became the makers of policy in the eighties. This brought us &quot;trickle down economics&quot; and corporate raiding and some other stuff. (Continued after aside...)</p>
<p>{deleted}</p>
<p>So the other key thing that happened is that the racists switched from the Democratic party to the Republican party in the sixties and seventies.</p>
<p>See &quot;Democrat&quot; used to to be the party of &quot;institutions&quot;, so business etc. these &quot;institutions&quot; included big business and racism was institutional before the Civil Rights Movement. This was an accident. If your government and business and your churches are all racist and you are in support of government and church and business, you got racist indoctrination as an underlayment.</p>
<p>The &quot;Republican&quot; was the party of &quot;individuals&quot; which <em>included</em> the Unions and Workers Rights and the Civil Rights Movement itself.</p>
<p>The important thing here is that business interests and workers rights were on opposite sides. </p>
<p>But then the Civil Rights Act passed. Institutions, particularly government and business <em>banished</em> racism.</p>
<p>So what's a racist to do? Well they switched sides.</p>
<p>So racism, my right to tell a ***** to (whatever) became an &quot;individual rights issue&quot;. People switched parties in droves. The fine &quot;Democrat&quot; institution of the KKK etc, wanted to continue on, so the message of the Republican party sounded like what they wanted.</p>
<p>The thing is that a lot of business and social (church) power was carried across the divide because those people <em>owned</em> those institutions and interests.</p>
<p>You have to look at the now-dead politicians of the age, the last to leave office or die being Strom Thurmond, who did the former by doing the latter. The pattern of defection from Democrat to Republican is historically obvious.</p>
<p>Even today, some GOP partisans point out that the KKK was a Democrat institution, but they lack the sense of history to understand why they should be suspicious that the KKK is now on their side.</p>
<p>See the Civil Rights Movement was revolutionary instead of evolutionary, so the structures of power didn't properly realign properly. Basically a lot of people moved &quot;right&quot; all at once, while nobody was moving left.</p>
<p>With the business owners and the unions now in the same party one had to lose status. Businesses had the money. A union couldn't shut down a business without losing the union, but a business could shut down a union and benefit.</p>
<p>Add to that the fact that a lot of people just plain old <em>didn't</em> <em>notice</em> that the sides had switched up. The less educated you were, the less likely you were to read the papers, the easier it was to miss the fact that you might now be voting for the wrong side.</p>
<p>Unionists had just <em>nobody</em> to vote for because they &quot;knew&quot; &quot;Democrats were bad for unions&quot;, and largely they <em>were</em>, having had no reason to change their tune. They still had a lot of business interest and whatnot, with no worker base.</p>
<p>So with the individual rights people, the unions, and the businesses all in the same pile the Republicans started dismantling what they'd built for the individuals. Their social support agenda, their actual pro-worker mandate, and their successful Social Security and Welfare programs were not in the interests of their new business buddies.</p>
<p>So the eighties were an orgasm of deregulation and &quot;corporate raiding&quot;.</p>
<p>See the Objectivists came of age but landed in charge of the side that is supposed to protect workers interests. So they just let go of their side of the rope and started pushing it towards the right, and the Democrats were pulling to the right out of habit.</p>
<p>Basically the Republicans leapfrogged over the Democrats so that the entire political spectrum was just slewing to the side we now call &quot;right&quot;.</p>
<p>The democrats eventually realized that someone needed to be on the left, but by then the damage had been done.</p>
<p>At this point, with nobody protecting individual incomes of the working middle class, and even the working upper class, the wage growth lines basically flatten out for everybody who isn't a business <em>owner</em>.</p>
<p>The Objectivists and the business men dismantle regulation.</p>
<p>The Savings and Loan system collapses, and the barriers between the three types of banks (commercial, investment, and <del>housing</del> consumer) disappear. Now banks that are supposed to anchor commercial and individual (worker) interest are free to gamble, which creates a series of bubbles and bursts that the workers and government interests have to support because the firewall around risky investment is <em>gone</em> and investment banks can no longer be allowed to fail because they'll take business and personal interests down in the blast.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, medical care has become for profit. Kaiser-Perminante (if memory serves) was the first non not-for-profit hospital, but once that barrier was pierced the HMOs and the for-profit hospitals took over in a tide.</p>
<p>The private institution of higher education has always been a thing, but with deregulation of student loans and the really broad application of the GI bill - and with the lack of political champions for education - tuition became a gold mine for schools. This happened right as the lust-for-advancement of the fifties was dying off. The dream of the twenties, thirties, and forties that science was going to solve everything died during a duck-and-cover exercise somewhere along the way.</p>
<p>Another regulation limited how many media companies any one business interest could control. With the death of that just a few businesses, a few <em>huge</em> businesses, can now &quot;set the message&quot;. &quot;Greed is good&quot;, &quot;they're poor because they are lazy&quot;, &quot;more deregulation will solve the problems of deregulation&quot;, &quot;free markets now&quot; (which is great for business but hell on workers). An endless series of messages that somehow just never understand that working people create value.</p>
<p>Democrats are slowly taking up the interests of the individual workers, the unions, the environment, and all the things that the Republicans dropped.</p>
<p>But terrific damage has been done. The economy and deregulation have left the vast majority of people far, far away from where they are supposed to be.</p>
<p>Meanwhile lots of people are one issue voters, voting for gun rights and electing people who want to remove every other law in their favor as a consequence.</p>
<p>Further still, there are people who've just got a formula for god-and-country or all-democrats-are-thieves (a leftover from when all democrats were businessmen).</p>
<p>And still further the &quot;big government is bad&quot; meme and the &quot;tax and spend&quot; meme that sits like a turd, ignoring the fact that the alternative is &quot;borrow and spend&quot;.</p>
<p>So the answer to your question is that someone &quot;scrambled the teams&quot; and orphaned the interests of the moderate worker who just wants a <em>fair</em> wage for <em>everybody</em>. Poor people vote republican because they think of Democrats as &quot;elitists&quot; because in the forties they <em>were</em>; that vote being totally blind to electing people who literally own elite country clubs. Rich people vote republican because it's good for their bank accounts. But then the republicans vote to dismantle <em>their</em> <em>own</em> prior policies that made our workforce so amazing and egalitarian. Meanwhile the Democrats are in a three-decades-long shell-shock identity crisis and our economy is slowly deflating as the money pours into the pockets of the ultra-rich.</p>

<p>Yes, this is USA-Centric. That's where I grew up. But if you look at our history of treaties and our role in the cold war, which was contemporary with this whole thing, and our control of two of the big-four world stock markets, it's pretty easy to see how we <em>exported</em> our worst ideas to the rest of &quot;the western world&quot;. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was alive for lots of this. I was born in 1964. I remember desegregation. I was initially republican. I am democrat now, but for lack of choice. As long as the U.S. has &quot;simple majority rule&quot;, as in you need 50% plus one guy to win, the math just gives any three-way split to the dominant party in the House, so we can't have nice things like a third party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No, I didn't &quot;forget about women entering the workforce&quot;, nor the &quot;illegal immigrants&quot;... nor automation. The continuous boogey-man of new workers is a role that has gone to Blacks, Irishmen, Scottsmen, Chinamen, and every other racist label you can think of. By always having some people forced to take slave-labor wages you can drive down the labor market artificially. Whenever fair labor laws change this for the current out-group we've seen economic booms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Kaiser Permanente&quot; is not-for-profit, but &quot;Kaiser Perminante Medical Group&quot; is a wholly owned for-profit entity. These sorts of distinctions are important. Sorry for confusing you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No, I am not a &quot;Communist&quot;, if you think everybody who references &quot;workers&quot; is a communist then you need to study the history of labor over the last 3 thousand years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, this is &quot;biased&quot;. Facts tend to be biased for having only one actual, factual condition.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The US had post WW2 economic boom of orgasmic levels between 1950s-80s.  Some of the world was hurt from war, and a lot of it wasn't even developed yet.</p>
<p>The US was untouched, and had a massive manufacturing base.  This was a time when an unskilled guy could go out into his community, stand next to a conveyor belt, and make a sold middle class salary.  The coal mines, auto plants and factories were all up and running.</p>
<p>Then things changed.  Other countries started to catch up.  Business owners realized they could ship jobs to other countries and slash payroll in half.  Now that there's less jobs, wages are being driven down because workers are getting desperate.</p>
<p>So that's kind of where we're at now.  An economy with fewer jobs at lower wages.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

My husband had about $2,000 in student loans left and I didn't go to college so we knocked that out ASAP. The plan was a house before pets or kids and we bought one 2 years after we married, in 1984. for $99k with 10% down. Very small (1000sq ft) but cute. That house nearly doubled in value in 8 years and because my husband started and finished his MBA during that time he got promotions and raises and a company car, while I quit to stay home with the kids. Sold that place and bought another smallish place (1350sq ft) with a second bath in a better community for for $235k.</p>
<p>We rode the SF Bay Area real estate boom after that and added a family room but never moved again. It was nothing we did special, we just played by the rules that were in place at the time, and they made sense.

<p>The concern is the creation of Nazi shrines, so you won't see big memorials specifically for those who fought for the Nazi cause. You will see memorials dedicated to the victims of the Nazi regime, though, and the soldiers are seen as victims as much as anyone else. The emphasis is less on honouring brave souls who fought and died for their country, but on comemmorating those who died at the hands of a dictatorial regime.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>German here.</p>
<p>In Germany there are a lot of roads and buildings referring to people that fought wars BEFORE world war one, mostly the 30 years war and the wars against France.</p>
<p>But finding anything honorable for the soldiers that fought in WW2 is very hard. As many others in this topic posted before, you can find small monuments on almost every graveyard in Germany, where the fallen soldiers are being remembered. </p>
<p>BUT overall in Germany there is nothing like Vets day in the US as we are all learn about the war crimes and the holocaust in school. Even 'innocent' generals like Guderian and Rommel are not remembered anywhere at all. If a German openly stated that he is a fan of Erwin Rommel, he would get weird looks from everyone around him (if he doesn't life in a far-right environment at least). This is a major difference between Germany and the US where you can easily say that you are a fan of Eisenhower or Bernard Montogomery.</p>
<p>The only Germans from WW2 that are really honored in our community are the ones who fought against the Third Reich while it still laste, e.g. Stauffenberg, Sophie and Hans Scholl, Georg Elser.</p>
<p>As for the vets in Germany, mostly everyone (including myself) has or had a gradfather who fought in the second world war. But in contrast to US-vets who probably are proud of their years in service, German vets are mostly ashamed of their time (or some are also still brainwashed by Nazi propaganda and will tell you stories about how amazing Nazi Germany was). My grandfather NEVER told me anything about his time in the Wehrmacht. The only things I remember is that he was able to tell me to close the door in French and Russian. But I first got the hint where he learned these languages after his death in 2004.</p>
<p>Some years ago I found a letter he wrote about his time in service, it is in German, but if anyone is interested, it would be a pleasure for me to translate ist.</p>
<p>EDIT: I made a (very rough, sorry!) translation of the letter, which can be found here: <a href="https://goo.gl/pE1K3u" target="_blank">https://goo.gl/pE1K3u</a>.
EDIT2: German original of the letter (with some gaps from where I was not able to read his hand writing): <a href="https://goo.gl/fWSOcJ" target="_blank">https://goo.gl/fWSOcJ</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most big, official memorials in Germany (including the Memorial Day on November 11th) are dedicated to &quot;all victims of war&quot; or something like that. You'll very rarely find anything honoring soldiers explicitly. If you do, it's probably pretty old and has been left there for historical significance (like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Victory_Column" target="_blank">Berlin Victory Column</a> that was built in the mid 19th century but upgraded with references to later wars, including WW2 while the war was still going on... and it very nearly got demolished multiple times for that, which would've been a shame because it's really one of the most important landmarks in the city).</p>
<p>In general most German's don't honor soldiers actively, neither past nor current. We don't do &quot;thank you for your service&quot; or special veteran's privileges or anything like that. People probably care privately about their family members, and the armed forces probably hold small services for people that die in e.g. Afghanistan, but there's no great parades or giant flags over a coffin like you would know in America. We don't really see it as anything more than other people doing a dangerous job that they get appropriately compensated for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My bachelor's thesis and some masters level research related to this topic. Some people have hit different aspects of this quite well already. There is little to no outright, direct memorialization (akin to something like the US WWII memorial in Washington D.C.). The few still-living veterans of the war rarely talk about their memories with anyone who didn't also experience them, so this has made research difficult. Even though it can generally be assumed that every man born between roughly between 1900 and 1945 served in some capacity, such men do not publicly &quot;wear&quot; their time in service. The few de facto WWII veterans associations are small, very private, and often can't be recognized as such by their name alone. Memorials specifically for the German soldiers in WWII don't exist, but that doesn't mean the siblings, children, grandchildren, friends, etc. of that troubled generation don't seek to honor and respect them despite the stain they all bore. As was correctly pointed out, WWI and Franco-Prussian War monuments often serve as proxy memorials. As for the victim memorials, it very much depends who you ask as to whether they think the soldiers should/are included in that category; regardless covert memorialization happens their far less frequently. In addition to this general societal discomfort with publicly affiliating with the quagmire of WWII, yes the issue of Neo-Nazi appropriation is also always a concern. The German government generally seeks to give them as little to affiliate with as possible. </p>
<p>Sidenote: I suppose it's not suprising the 'clean Wehrmacht' issue was brought up. The scholarly evidence is overwhelming that the Wehrmacht was complicit, instrumental even, in the crimes of the Nazis <em>as an organization</em> but no it does not mean every individual was an evil, Jew-hating Nazi. Funnily enough German academia and I think society came to terms with the dirty Wehrmacht earlier and easier than a lot of Americans did ( some American military scholars and history buffs often have a peculiar erection for the German Army). The fact that the word cuck was thrown around shows you that this issue inevitably draws in less savory extreme-right sorts. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
