		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Long time lurker but finally a question I can answer. (Source: am materials scientist who works on softness in industry).</p>
<p>Softness is a complex, multi-variable phenomena which we think involves two components: 1) the material a person touches and 2) the persons [somatosensory system] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system</a>), which is a combination of the nerves in your finger and neural system. Since the brains involved, things start to get complex. </p>
<p>Like the other commenters have mentioned, a simple reason for observing why a piece of cat hair is soft is linked to the fiber diameter. In fact, research has <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/004051756103100710" target="_blank">shown</a> that a small fiber diameter of a material class does link to a greater degree of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/app.23898" target="_blank">softness</a> . But pet your cat in one direction (toward the tail) and a different direction (away from the tail), and you might have a different experience. What this means is that by orienting the fibers in a different ways, you're body can register a difference sense of softness. </p>
<p>Taking it on step further, the micro and mezo-structures of the fiber also (things like kink, curl, or shape) play a part. Surface coatings, and blooming agents are readily sought in the synthetic fiber making world to enable softness at the fiber level. All different type of animal (and people for that matter) have different natural hairs which kink, lay straight or flat depending upon the way the hair is formed.</p>
<p>The macro structure of a fabric or group of hair matters too as there is active research ongoing to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781845691356500025" target="_blank">characterize</a> the behavior of fabrics and other composite materials like velvet. You can get into macro level properties like drape, compressive modulus, friction, and even the sound of fabric or hair, to get into a response that could be considered soft. </p>
<p>The other aspect (which I don't have good sources for other than data I've generated) is that what you put <em>behind</em> a material matters immensely. If you put your cat hair on top of brick, you are likely to not think its so soft versus against the cat's skin, since the skin bends easily. An analogy would be, take a piece of velvet and wrap it around a brick. That velvet brick will likely feel soft to the touch if you barely put pressure on the top of the fabric, but put a little more pressure, and it doesn't feel so great. </p>
<p>The reason I put &quot;we think&quot; at the top is because unfortunately the instruments used to measure softness are humans, so the variability in the data is very high. In fact, not having an &quot;anchor&quot; in a softness assessment almost always provides data that isn't repeatable from test to test (i.e. feather = 1, brick = 10). Further more, since the somatosensory system involves your brain, things like sounds, color, what you ate, how you feel that day, can skew data. We can find general trends in the data which point toward some general characteristics for softness directions (small smooth fibers, in a highly drapable and cushiony fabric), but within material groups, differences are hard to find. </p>
<p>Lastly, the aspect that really makes things difficult, and I find fascinating, is that across cultures, softness perception changes. I have seen two study groups from Japan/China and the US have completely opposite opinions of what &quot;cottony&quot; means. Even using a material that is considered soft in one culture, doesn't work in another because of how softness is defined in each.</p>
<p>TL;DR : It depends. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would agree with funintheburbs comment, but add that it is not just the 'give' of the material as a whole that gives it that velvety feeling (for example, a sheet of cotton has a lot of give, but does not produce the same feeling as cat fur), but also the diameter and density of the fibers comprising the surface of that material. A material with a high density of narrow, flexible fibers will feel soft, like fur. The same material with less give would feel like toothbrush bristles. So it's really the fact that there are very many narrow and flexible fibers making contact with your skin all at once that produce a furry feeling when brushed against.</p>
<p>To go even deeper, the micro-structure of those fibers plays a role as well. If the micro-structure is rougher (nano-scale pits), the additional friction will make the material feel rougher.</p>
<p>Edit: I would actually modify my argument (per the_epic_narwhal's question regarding the smoothness of leather) to say that the most important factor is not the fibrous nature, but the surface microstructure. If the fibers are smooth, and you brush your hand against them, you are essentially pressing them into a uniform surface, so it would be similar to brush your hand against a well worn piece of leather or other material with few surface imperfections.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are used to thinking of the senses in the very basic categories we learned in elementary school - sight, hearing, touch, smell, touch.  But what we experience is not raw sensory input, it is our brain’s interpretation of a variety of sources of information compiled together into a constructed perception of reality.</p>
<p>Touch is made up of a large number of individual systems and nerve types.  Mechanoreceptors respond at a basic level to pressure and stretching, and there are several types that are specialized for certain kinds of sensation (soft pressure, deep pressure, sustained pressure, vibration):  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanoreceptor" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanoreceptor</a></p>
<p>Hair on our body serves to further enhance the variety of sensations we can perceive, as the mechanoreceptors attached to each respond to its complex movement.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are nerves for sensing temperature change, pain, the spatial position of our body and angles of our joints (proprioception), balance (inner ear hair cells), etc.</p>
<p><strong>So back to your question - what makes something feel soft or furry?</strong></p>
<p>There isn’t a sensory nerve type dedicated to furry things, or to wetness, or to the feeling of wind blowing.  Rather, these are all interpretations our brain deduces based on the compilation of sensory information (or lack thereof!) it is receiving from all of the nerve types above.  Brushing against something furry will incite a mixture of responses due to hair movement, light pressure, temperature change, etc, that fits the brain’s pattern for “fuzzy”.  Proprioception plays a role here too, as our brain uses the position of our body (the finger touching the cat) in its interpretation of the tactile senses coming from contact with it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Friction. At a microscopic level, every surface looks very different. Your fingers/hands are pretty rough too. You feel something is &quot;soft&quot; when a material can slide around on your hand without tugging on it too much. Harder surfaces will give more resistance.</p>
<p>Fibers that are thicker and coarser like wool also are likely to feel rough to your hands in comparison to smaller and smoother fibers like silk.</p>
<p>Another factor is warmth. How insulating a material is can impact how it feels to you. Something made of metal will feel cold or hot to the touch depending on the temperature because heat flows readily between your hand and the surface. Something insulating like most animal hair fibers will not draw heat from you easily, making it feel warmer, which adds to your feeling of &quot;softness&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sorry in advance for not being good at inserting equations onto Reddit...  </p>
<p>When your hand comes into contact with something, it is slowed by the force of the object on your hand. If the collision between your hand takes more time, the amount of force applied to your hand is less. If the object has &quot;give,&quot; it will take time to deform, which increases the time of the collision between it and your hand, which decrease the amount of force it applies to you. If the object did not have as much give, the collision would take less time, which would mean a larger force acting on your hand.  </p>
<p>This can be summed up by the concept of impulse, which is also defined as the change in momentum (final momentum minus initial momentum), which is equal to the net force acting on the object multiplied by the time over which that force acts.  </p>
<p>The concept can also be approached through the common version of Newton's second law, net force equals mass times acceleration. The more rapid the acceleration of your hand during the collision with an object, the more force it will exert on your hand. Here, less give means less time, which means a greater acceleration, which means a greater net force.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This means the medicine is formulated as the hydrochloride salt.  Many drugs are organic amines, which would otherwise be basic, so neutralizing them with hydrochloric acid to form the corresponding salt is part of formulating them into a neutral form patients can take.  This also makes them more water soluble for better bioavailability, and more crystalline for better stability and compounding.</p>
<p>Tetracycline, for instance, <a href="https://www.drugs.com/pro/tetracycline.html" target="_blank">is only very slightly soluble in water and has an amine group</a> that makes it a base, with a pKa corresponding to a pH of 8.3.  But hydrochloric acid neutralizes this, and the hydrochloride salt is crystalline (good for making into a pill) and &quot;freely soluble&quot; in water.</p>
<p>Similarly, the beta-blocker, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propranolol" target="_blank">propranolol</a>, has an amine group and is formulated as the hydrochloride in <a href="https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-10404-9168/propranolol-oral/propranolol-oral/details" target="_blank">Inderol</a>; the anti-depressant, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bupropion" target="_blank">buproprion</a>, has an amine group and is formulated as the hydrochloride in <a href="https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-13507-7155/bupropion-hcl-oral/bupropion-extended-release-antidepressant-oral/details" target="_blank">Wellbutrin</a>; etc.</p>
<p>A lot of science goes into properly formulating drugs, including the <a href="http://www.pharmtech.com/salt-selection-drug-development" target="_blank">salt selection</a>.  Some things you may target for are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aqueous solubility measured at various pH values, depending upon the intended pharmaceutical profile</p>
<p>High degree of crystallinity</p>
<p>Low hygroscopicity (i.e., water absorption versus relative humidity), which gives consistent performance</p>
<p>Optimal chemical and solid-state stability under accelerated conditions (i.e., minimal chemical degradation or solid-state changes when stored at 40 °C and 75% relative humidity)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not all drugs are basic, some are an acid and must be neutralized with a base instead of an acid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned before, that’s the hydrochloride salt. Speaking from a chemist’s point of view, preparing a chemical as the salt is often convenient. Many chemicals are noncrystalline solids or oils in the basic form, and these are hard to work with. So called “street chemists” are familiar with this as well, since syntheses of illicit drugs often have a “salting out” step where the drug is converted to the hydrochloride or other salt and precipitates from the solution as crystals. There are several pluses to this: </p>
<ul>
<li>A crystalline solid can be easier to measure and mix than an amorphous solid or oil</li>
<li>“Salting out” results in the final product precipitating from the reaction solution (so you can then pour off the reaction mixture with all the solvent, unreacted starting materials, and side products) making it a lot easier to isolate the product</li>
<li>The crystalline product is a salt, which can reduce its solubility in nonpolar solvents, so you can rinse the crystals in the appropriate solvent to further purify them without losing a lot of material </li>

<p>The way you detect wetness is predominantly the sensation of cold, which is often associated with wetness, particularly in the normal environment in which we evolved. Wet things are generally colder. And even if they are not colder your fingers get wet and as the water evaporates off your fingers and rapidly cools your skin. </p>
<p>There might be other smaller component of maybe your skin being more slippery when wet etc but this doesn’t play a huge part. You’d have to run your skin together to appreciate any tiny differences in friction so it’s not a big component.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Fun anecdote showing the short comings of this:
A dry-suit is worn by divers and boaters in cold and wet weather to keep warm and most importantly dry. The dry suit covers your whole body, leaving only your head and hands exposed. Neoprene collar and cuffs seal you in so you can submerge without getting wet. However, the first time you get in the water after putting on a dry suit, you feel wet! The water pushes the suit against your skin, and is cold, so the two senses get interpreted as being wet! Only after you move around a little do you realize that you are still dry inside the dry suit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thermal conductivity. It’s the same reason your feet feel cold when you walk on the bathroom tile first thing in the morning, but warm when you step on the carpet. The carpet and tile are actually the same temperature- what your brain is detecting is the heat flux between you feet and the floor.</p>
<p>Since room temperature is colder than the human body, room temperature things draw heat away from the body. Things with high thermal conductivity, like water, metal, or ceramic tile, feel cold. Things with low thermal conductivity like carpet, plastic, or foam, feel neutral. </p>
<p>Same goes for hot things. You are much more likely to experience pain from a hot metal thing than a hot plastic thing, even if they’re at the same temp (think about the seat belt buckle in your car on a hot summer day. Would you rather grab plastic or metal?)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

As a result, the shaded side grows faster than the sunny side, so the plant grows towards the sun.</p>
<p>In roots however, the same substance inhibits growth so that roots grow downwards. Its distribution is affected by gravity. The lower side has a higher concentration so its growth is inhibited more.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your observation hits upon a half-truth: Yes, the RSA is a mineral rich territory. Yet, it is not alone, and its competitors share similar wealth for the same reasons.</p>
<p>This relative richness has to be put in context, and when one does so, it turns out that the RSA is neither richer nor poorer than other similar terranes.</p>
<p>What matters here is the notion of &quot;similar terranes&quot;, and those are what us geologists call &quot;<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craton" target="_blank">Cratons</a></strong>&quot; (well ... we do that ...). The key to the RSAs mineral wealth is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaapvaal_Craton" target="_blank">Kaapvaal craton</a>, an assemblage of (mostly) Archean meta-intrusive and meta-volcanic rocks 3.6 to 2.5 billion years old. For a wide variety of reasons, rocks of that age and nature have experienced a number of ore-deposit generating processes, many of which operate differently, or even not all, today. This ties into the concept of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/mineral-deposit/Flowing-surface-water#ref624345" target="_blank">metallogenic epochs</a>, where different ore deposits are formed as the Earth, and the processes operating there, change through time. For instance, the appearance of free oxygen in abundance in the atmosphere during the Proterozoic (and hydrosphere) had tremendous consequences for the formation of iron and uranium deposits as it changed the chemistry of surface waters. In the specific case of the Kaapvaal, one may find there:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layered_intrusion" target="_blank">Layered mafic intrusive</a>-related Cu-Ni±Co±Cr and platinum group element (PGE) deposits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/95JB00190" target="_blank">Mesothermal gold deposits</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>diamondiferous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberlite" target="_blank">kimberlites</a></p>
</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanogenic_massive_sulfide_ore_deposit" target="_blank">Volcanogenic Cu-Zn (etc.) massive sulphide deposits</a></li>
</ul>
<p>and others.</p>
<p>However, the Kaapvaal in pretty much on par with other cratons of that age range. Compare it for instance with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_Craton" target="_blank">Superior province of the Canadian Shield</a>, which is one of the richest areas on the globe in terms of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030192689290111Z" target="_blank">known mineral resources and past production</a>, with similar types of deposits (or, if you can access it, see: <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/books/book/813/chapter/3911809/Geology-and-Mineral-Deposits-of-the-Superior" target="_blank">Card, K. D., Poulsen, K. H., &amp; Lucas, S. B. (1998). Geology and mineral deposits of the Superior Province of the Canadian Shield. Geology of the Precambrian Superior and Grenville Provinces and Precambrian Fossils in North America, Geology of North America, 1, 13-204.</a>)</p>
<p>The same can be said of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_shields_and_cratons" target="_blank">several other cratons</a>. I'll grant you however that some of these may have been mined out as they are closer to long populated areas and were suject to a protracted history of production (the Fennoscandian shield for instance). But many of those are the treasure chests on which we currently rely for a vary large part of the mienral resources we currently depend on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The fact that it was intruded into an already ancient Craton has given it long-term stability (and might have played a role in the intrusion's evolution, although I'm not an expert on this). </p>
<p>Diamonds are also associated with cratons as they tend to form at the roots of Archaean cratons (the Kaapvaal Craton in the case of South Africa) and are later brought up in explosive events.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many of them are there because the underlying rock is very old and minerals have had time to move around to places where we can mine them. There are plenty of places in South Africa with proterozoic rocks and rocks older than 2.5 billion years... Many of the minerals we care about accumulate in deposits we can mine because water slowly picks it up and redeposits it other places. This is a little like the lime-scale on your water faucets at home but it can happen to gold!</p>
<p>The other one is due to a structure called kimberlites and they are famously rich in diamond. Kimberlites are reasonably rare and South Africa happens to have them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

by Helen Pilcher  has a good chapter about this. Basically the Northern White Rhino has been functionally extinct for years. The sad truth is it's just a waiting game to find out the exact of when they will disappear, likely forever.</p>
<p>Based on physical appearances we believed the Northern and Southern White Rhinos were sub species and therefore it was not as important to to protect them both individually.  It turns out we were wrong, the northern and southern whites cannot crossbread, meaning they are more genetically distinct from each other that dogs/wolves, horses/zebra, cattle/bison and any other cross-able species.</p>
<p>They tried a bunch of things to save the species but the only remaining specimens were too old or had other problems making breeding impossible. They tried artificial insemination but it's very difficult because rhinos have complex labyrinthine vaginal canals. Which has also made it very hard to try to implant IVF eggs into the southern rhino species as a type of genetic rescue, it could risk the surrogate mother's life.</p>
<p>We have preserved DNA from these three and several other white rhinos, but at this point (and for years now) the only chance of preserving this species is through genetic rescue, essentially finding a safe way to clone these last few animals and implant them into an existing rhino species.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>To touch on this part of your comment, the two females are unable to get pregnant but it's believed their eggs are viable so Kenya is working on developing a method for extracting those eggs.  If successful, they can implant a genetically pure Northern White Rhino fertilized egg into a southern rhino surrogate. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here are the basics to get you started:</p>
<p>1- Subspecies definition</p>
<p>The fact that these are considered subspecies, and not full species, tells us that whoever researched them originally decided they were not genetically different enough to be their own species. I can't claim genetics were definitely involved (in &quot;early days&quot; subspecies vs. species depended on how differently two populations looked and behaved, which is still relevant today in some cases).</p>
<p>Here is a really non-scientific example of what this means. We humans are all one species. Let's say, in no racist manner, that &quot;Americans&quot; are considered the standard human. The British are then discovered. The British are clearly humans, but they sound a little odd, look a bit different, and occur in a different part of the world. They are not different enough to be their own species, but possibly a subspecies (the English and Americans are not actually their own subspecies, but this is a fictional example). In other words, a subspecies is very similar to the original, but not completely.</p>
<p>So, compared to the other rhino species, the death of one subspecies is not quite as important. Why? Because the species still survives (white rhino), just that one population (a subspecies) will die out (the northern subspecies). The loss of a subspecies does not mean the animal is extinct entirely, because another subspecies still exists. A subspecies however does represent a unique genetic variant of the &quot;white rhino&quot; species and should be preserved if possible, but it isn't as bad as losing an entire species.</p>
<p>So anyone mourning &quot;the loss of a species&quot; is not wrong, but they aren't right either, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>2- Rejuvenation</p>
<p>So there are a few factors here but we can't straight up impregnate a southern white rhino with northern genetics. That would produce a hybrid, and hybrids are 50/50 of each. That doesn't save anything, because hybrids can never produce pure parents. You can mix red and white paint, to get pink paint, but you can never get pure red and white back out.</p>
<p>I'm not so up on the actual science of solutions here, but to actually rejuvenate the northern white rhino you would have to have 100% northern DNA involved. From my explanation you would expect there to be a &quot;base white rhino DNA&quot; and then DNA specific to each subspecies. Sadly it isn't that simple, you can't just take a &quot;basic white rhino DNA&quot; from southern and combine it with &quot;unique northern DNA&quot;. It just doesn't work that way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of the explanation for this would fall into how scientists (neuroscientists/neurologists in this case) don't quite know yet. It has to do with encoding memories.
There are theories and some evidence to say that we are actually capable of recalling or bringing back any memory from any time in our lives, although most of us struggle to remember what we had for breakfast last Tuesday.
Over our lifetime, or brains can't just be constantly replaying information, or else they wouldn't also be storing new information. Not that those are mutually exclusive. However, if you're off daydreaming about that time you were on a beach with pina coladas, you're not going to be as readily recalling what you're currently looking at. Then again, here too, that doesn't mean that you couldn't. In fact, you could be prompted somehow to recall this sort of visual echoic memory, even if you are daydreaming away.</p>
<p>More to the point, our brains are somehow soaking up lots of stimuli in our neurons, re-wiring, and making connections with different synapses and neurotransmitters. When they make an assocation in a certain way, it plays to us as a memory. Larger connections will play as imagines and what we think of as &quot;memories.&quot; Meanwhile, other connections - actually in specific parts of the brain studied for language comprehension - will play to us as words. Then other areas as music, smell and so on. We're able to build up a seemingly limitless capacity to make these connections. I hope that answers your first point about why we're able to store so much.</p>
<p>As for why it's tough to recall all of the words, we don't have complete control over putting the connections together. The connections can be put together, and over time you would of course recall all the words and be able to list them. But perhaps not without stimulation to make those connections come together. If you're sitting at your desk writing this list, each time you look around the room you'll think of more words. Open the door and there's 1000 more. You have more connections you can make.</p>
<p>If you're into computers, a good comparison is RAM and Disk Space. Your RAM is much smaller, and it'll integrate whatever you're actually using and working with (your connections at hand). Whereas the Disk Space has all of the things you've stored over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
