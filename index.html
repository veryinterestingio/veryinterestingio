<p>There seems to be some evidence that there may be multiple follicular mechanisms that slow the production of melanin by follicular melanocytes over time.  Some more recent evidence suggests that greying results from a failure of melanocytic stems cells to replenish the supply of mature melanocytes.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hairstylist and cosmetology  instructor here!</p>
<p>Your hair contains several parts. It grows from the follicle in the scalp and your follicles contain melanocytes that produce eumelanin (black pigment) and pheomelanin (red pigment). </p>
<p>Individual hair strands are made of the cuticle (outer scaley layer), the cortex (the inner layer), and the medulla,  which is only present in certain hair types. Melanin is located in the cortex and medulla. As we age the melanocytes in your hair follicle die off and the hair no longer contains pigment. </p>
<p>When you color your hair with permanent color to cover gray, the ammonia and hydrogen peroxide in color open up the cuticle to allow the artificial pigments to enter the hair. Some colors lift some of the natural pigment in addition to depositing pigment. They penetrate deep enough into the cortex and medulla that they don't wash out. Demi permanent color opens the cuticle a bit to allow the pigment to penetrate the shaft but not as deep, that way the color fades back to the original color.  Demi permanent color does not lift the natural hair color. Semi permanent color (usually unnatural fashion colors) only coats the hair strand. It does not alter the hair chemically in any way, and fades quickly.</p>
<p>Edit: Correction! The melanocytes don't exactly die off but they stop producing pigment. I believe cells produce hydrogen peroxide as a byproduct and as we age our hair follicles get worse at getting rid of the peroxide, this combined with the melanocytes causes gray hair. The hydrogen peroxide is also why gray hair feels wiry and stiff, because it's almost like your hair is being bleached within the follicle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

For “silver” surfaces, there is no dip in the spectrum, instead the metal reflects less than 100% of the total incoming light and therefore appears grey-ish.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because &quot;silver&quot; isn't really a color like the others, it's just what we call a neutral reflective surface.</p>
<p>Real surfaces don't have just one color, they are more complicated than that. When we think of a basic colored surface, we usually think of the <em>diffuse</em> color. A matte color, in other words. Matte white is what we call a surface that reflects all light, but scatters it.</p>
<p>But some surfaces are shiny. That shiny reflection can also be colored, and we call that the <em>specular</em> color. It can be different from the diffuse color for any given material! And different surfaces can have a different balance between matte and shiny. For example, white ceramic/china is somewhere in between, with a strong matte component (the main white part) but a very noticeable shine. A lot of surfaces have a non-white matte component, but a totally white/neutral shine.</p>
<p>When it comes to most colors, we don't really distinguish between matte and shiny in the way we talk about them. But it turns out that surfaces that reflect all colors, but are predominantly matte or shiny, are common enough and distinct enough that we give them different names: white and silver, respectively.</p>
<p>There are some other examples, e.g. we call something with a lot of shine that is yellow &quot;gold&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>if you see something as silver, it wouldn’t be reflecting all of the colours.</p>
<p>If we talk about mirrors, it would be because of the angle of reflection. If a mirror is placed at an angle such that a blue flashlight is reflecting at you, it reflects all of that blue flashlight, it doesn’t suddenly find red where red isn’t</p>
<p>edit: also you must remember how colours work. If you see red, it means that whatever you are looking at that is red, is simply absorbing all other colour wavelengths and only reflecting red. So a surface like a mirror that is showing red, is actually only reflecting the light that other stuff doesn’t absorb.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I understand the concept of ground water.  On Oak Island they continually make the distinction that when they dig deep enough sea water fills their bore holes.  Is the presence of sea/salt water anomalous when digging on a small island that is surrounded by sea water?</p>
<p>Would typical geology be porous enough to allow salt water to flow/seep beneath the ground?  It seems to me that this would not be a strange thing to encounter.  But, I am not a geologist.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way freshwater accumulates on small islands depends very much on the geological, hydrogeological and geophysical conditions. Vegetation affects underground water salinity as does rainfall history. Even the very act of them pumping out their pit will cause a potential change in underground water salinity dynamics. Salt water doesn’t desalinate because it passes through porous rock or sand, so any freshwater on the island usually gets there via rainfall and is stored in the underground aquifers. When you get saltwater intrusion it’s because saline water moves into freshwater aquifers due to pumping out of the fresh.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The original story of a &quot;there is treasure buried here&quot;:</p>
<ol>
<li>there is no extant evidence of any of this story... no one knows what happened to these remarkable things in the story</li>
<li>the story really isn't possible.  Pirates did not bury treasure.  Why would you leave a marker specifying to anyone that you'd buried it there?  And you can't dig on Oak Island very far at all.  If you did bury anything deep, it's not safe.  Salt water will come in.</li>
</ol>
<p>The original &quot;money pit&quot; was a sinkhole, very common in the area. &quot;layers of log platforms&quot; found- well, you don't build platforms when digging a hole at all.  You shore up the sides, but that's not this.  These are just logs sucked into a sinkhole.</p>
<p>The &quot;flood tunnels&quot; are not manmade.  In fact there really isn't such a thing as a manmade &quot;flood tunnel&quot; and it would not be possible to build.  The flooding of excavations is going to happen because of natural water flooding- Oak Island is unusual geology of having a fantastic depth of glacial till (gravel) over bedrock and it does create unusual flooding of excavations.  Again, why you could not bury treasure there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eye doc here:  Think of the eye as a complete system for bending light. The goal is to have the light in focus on the back of the eye (retina). </p>
<p>The main focusing factors are the curvature of the cornea (fixed/doesn't change), the curvature of the lens (not fixed/can add (+) power only), and the length of the eye (decides if the other two are doing it good enough or not enough.</p>
<p>If you are near sighted that is a way of saying your entire system has too much power for the length of your eye...which means you have built in reading (near power) so we use minus powered lenses to correct that light to focus on the retina. In a near sighted person the lens in the eye is relaxed because adding even more power would just make things more blurry.</p>
<p>If you are far sighted the eye is under powered for the current length of your eye, so adding more (+)power is needed, which the lens in your eye can do...in other words the lens can act &quot;like a pair of glasses&quot; for a far sighted person...except straining all the time like this can cause headaches and eye strain.</p>
<p>The ability of the lens in the eye to bend is deteriorated over time regardless of &quot;muscle strength&quot; which is why it wouldn't help to do eye exercises. Eye exercises are beneficial to folks who can't bend their lenses as well as others in their young age group (younger than 40)</p>
<p>The reason LASIK works is the front curvature of the cornea is reshaped to match the length of the eye so things are in focus for the distance. To see things up close the lens in the eye still needs to bend and flex, which is why after age 40 those people with LASIK still need to wear reading glasses. (Reading glasses give the (+) power needed that the lens bending used to give but no longer can)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit4: Most importantly, what I put in my original post and 2 edits didn't tell the whole story. Please, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/e5gpe5/eli5_if_the_eye_focuses_with_muscles_how_canwhy/f9knwqg" target="_blank">follow this link</a> for a better, in depth explanation from an eye doctor /u/chemical_refraction.</p>
<p>TL:DR ELI5: Exercising your eye muscles only works for far sighted people that are younger than 40 years old and cannot bend their lens as well as they should. The muscles you would be 'exercising' only affect the lens of the eye (only a potion of how you focus) that deteriorates as you age. It also would not help astigmatisms</p>
<p>Basically, the muscles have their limits. The muscles stretch the lens of the eye to pull the light into exact (it has very sensitive tolerances) focus (near/far) onto the retina. The lens only accounts for 25-35% of the focusing power of your eye. You can make minor gains by 'training' these muscles and making them stronger but then you bounce against the limits.</p>
<p>There are no muscles that stretch the cornea (as far as I can tell) which accounts for 65-75% of your eye's focusing power. The cornea is also where an astigmatism (misshaped cornea) lives so you cannot fix an astigmatism by doing eye exercises.</p>
<p>Edit: apparently astigmatism can live in the lens as well. This makes sense but TIL.</p>
<p>Finally, as you age your cornea and lens will become more dense/rigid and you cannot stretch it as much so your ability to focus diminishes (why we have bi- or even trifocal glasses).</p>

<p>Edit3: People have brought up the fact (and they aren't wrong) that nearsightedness and farsightedness has to do with the overall shape of the eye (long/short).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, what you describe is possible through a process called difference sum generation. The idea is that if you pass two beams through special types of matter, one at a frequency f1 and another at f2 you can produce a beam at a frequency f3 given by:</p>
<p>f3=f1-f2.</p>
<p>The process is roughly shown in <a href="https://i.imgur.com/O6FY7FM.png" target="_blank">this diagram.</a> A slightly more famous cousin of this effect is where the frequencies add up (such that f3=f1+f2), called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sum-frequency_generation" target="_blank">sum frequency generation</a>. The latter effect is apparently more famous to get its own Wiki article, but the physics is very similar. </p>
<p>The reason you need to pass the beams through matter is that this effect is non-linear. Normally two light waves passing passed each other absolutely would not give a fuck that the other was there. In more sciency terms we would say that the cross-section for non-linear interactions was very low. But in certain types of materials these effects get rather probable. </p>
<p>To get back to your original question though, yes this effect has an analogue in acoustics called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_(acoustics\)" target="_blank">beating</a>. While the physical mechanism is a bit different when talking about sound waves and light, some aspects stay the same, e.g. the fact that the effect kicks in at the difference in frequency of the two interacting waves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's two parts to this problem, the first being whether or not you can apply the concept of acoustic beats to EM waves, and the second being, if you can, can humans perceive the lower frequency as being a new shade of color.</p>
<p>If we limit ourselves to only pure tones (sine waves) for both sound and light, then I believe acoustic beats would indeed happen with light (note: I am not saying that we could <em>perceive</em> them, but that you would get the same shape of wave). This is because of the superposition principle, the idea that you can simply add the intensity of two EM waves to get the resulting wave. A consequence of the superposition principle is that waves don't interact with each other i.e. they're independent. </p>
<p>The superposition principle holds for acoustics as well, meaning that the waves don't interact. So how can two new frequencies come about if the waves don't interact? It's because two sine waves of differing frequencies, when added together, are mathematically equivalent to a sine wave with a <em>higher</em> frequency that varies in <em>volume</em> at a lower frequency (see the wikipedia page for beats (acoustics)). This is NOT the same as two new waves being formed with these two new frequencies, it's actually that a new higher frequency wave results that is <em>multiplied</em> (not added with) the lower frequency wave (this can also be stated as the lower frequency wave being multiplied by the higher frequency one). This is due purely to the math and requires just no direct interaction, and no human perception. So I believe the answer to the first part of the problem is that yes, you will get an EM wave with the same shape as an acoustic wave corresponding to acoustic beats because the math is the same, so now we can focus on whether or not we can perceive it.</p>
<p>For the second part, I honestly don't have an answer, but I will tell you what I know to hopefully create some discussion to figure out the answer.</p>
<p>Our ears work through Fourier decomposition (imagine graphing intensity vs. frequency), but despite that, we will still hear a beat tone if two sine waves are close enough in frequency. Once they're farther apart, we hear the two tones independently, which corresponds to the equivalent Fourier decomposition of two spikes, one at each frequency of the two sound sources. So even for acoustics, the answer to whether or not we perceive the beat frequency can be either yes or no, even when the beat frequency in question is in the audible range!</p>
<p>As for light, the cones in our eyes work completely differently, with each type of cone having its own frequency response, with a given cone (red, green, or blue) being able to react to a large frequency of visible light spanning multiple colors. We perceive color through the brain interpreting the differing intensities of light hitting each cone, meaning that you can perceive yellow both from a pure yellow wave as well as from a combination of red and green added together. In the case of red + green, the lower beat frequency is in the infrared range (roughly 25-100Thz), and the upper beat frequency is in the yellow to orange range (being the average of the two) so the fact that we see yellow is purely based on the ratios of how much each of the three cone types is firing and NOT due to EM beats.</p>
<p>As you suggested in your question, OP, combining UV and infrared light of the right frequencies would indeed produce light with a lower beat frequency in the visible spectrum, and I would be extremely interested to know if this beating can be picked up by our eyes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

A master vinyl is etched using a much heavier etching head that has a tracking system to GO INWARDS at a constant rate. This is reflected In how the vinyl is played back except your needle follows the grooves and so is controlled by the grooves. The speed, 45 or 33 rpm, remains constant during master etching and final playback. Though technically you can (and do) master at lower speeds to improve quality.
So yes the outer tracks move faster and therefore have higher &quot;bandwidth&quot; or fidelity (even though these are different terms, they both apply)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>That's why on a lot of records that have been mastered with some thought, the tracks with a brighter sound (more high frequency content) tend to be closer to the outer edge of the record, because it's the high frequencies that become less possible to reproduce as the &quot;inches of track per second of audio&quot; value drops, as it's naturally going to as you get further towards the middle of the record.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>humor boinks the part of our brain that is related to scary stuff, this is because humor works by attempting to subvert expectations. when the brain recognizes that an unexpected outcome was not due to something dangerous, it boinks memory centers that use laughters goofy body chemicals to remind us of positive not-dangerous stuff.</p>
<p>then, humans as social animals leveraged humor's ability to boink positive feelings to form communities and forge better social ties. we associate laughing together as positive so we laugh even when something isnt that funny- that's the extrinsic reason why we &quot;know&quot; something is funny.</p>
<p>it's why someone like jordan peele, a career comedian can make a move like Get Out. comedy and horror follow similar logical maybe neurological paths, it's only the reveal/punchline that determine if something is hilarious or horrifying</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>your brain collects all of your experience, it's like a cloud for today's digital world. all of your interaction with family, friends, teachers, coaches, pastors, books, television, movies, art, pornography etc... are sifted through, and re-organized, and re-shaped, and re-stored in your brain where it begins to make make sense of this perceived world and your place in it. the information you expose yourself to begins to inform yourself, and how you should act or think in certain situations, or moments. the more you expose yourself too, the more your brain has to draw from.</p>
<p>Say, you are sitting with your friend, and they cut their finger while peeling an apple. you ask if they are okay. they say, &quot;'tis merely a flesh wound&quot; you both might laugh because you both have seen &quot;National Lampoons European Vacation&quot; movie, and liked the part where the bicyclist said this same line after a horrible crash. and your friend's accident is hardly as horrible, so, it's funny when the two opposing ideas are next to each other. If your friend saw the movie, and you did not, it may not register as something funny, because you are not drawing from the same background. </p>
<p>our brains also like to organize material by comparing and contrasting them. so, let's say you know a lot about cooking, and you read a story about a hapless chef. this may be funny to you because you understand the &quot;right&quot; or &quot;ordered&quot; way of doing things in the kitchen, and this chef's way of doing things do not meet the standard you know to be true, and its funny because it's &quot;wrong&quot;, but also a story, and not happening to you. Now, say you know a lot about cooking and you are grading the opening of a new restaurant, and it's success means a lot to your bottom line. these same things that you thought funny in a story, may not be funny when more is at stake, but will probably be funny when you re-tell the story to a friend.</p>
<p>same goes for most buddy comedies. one person is a bit of a wreck, and the other is buttoned up, and the problems they cause for each other are funny because we have an idea of how each one likes to behave, and how they like their world to be ordered.</p>
<p>So, in short, humor is developed through experiences and expectations of our perceived world to any situation. the more you have to draw from, the more humor you can find in any situation.</p>

Aluminum is like a hamburger so it's really really easy to oxidize, so easy in fact that if other metals weren't added to it, the can wouldn't make it out of the factory. Other things are added to keep it from being &quot;eaten&quot; so quickly. Plastics on the other hand are very complex molecules that are very hard to eat. They're big like a huge bowl of jellybeans but also complex, like each one is in it's own wrapper that's really hard to open, so oxidizing plastic is very hard. This is partly by design so that the plastic will last. We can make Plastics that are easy to decompose. Compostable plastics are available, do a Google search for them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aluminum is a metal that is relatively easily oxidized. In contrast, plastics are polymers made up almost entirely of C-C and C-H bonds which are among the most difficult to break. Just to give you a sense of this, ethane steam crackers operate at near 1000 C. Because of this bond strength, plastics are relatively inert - oxygen and/or water doesn't react with them the same way they do with aluminum. This makes them great for storage and packaging, but really bad from an environmental perspective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>edit: I said bacteria, but its actually <em>fungi</em> that &quot;learned&quot; to break down wood</p>
<p>It's a similar situation to why we have coal in the ground. MIllions of years ago when trees first existed, nothing that lived on earth was good at breaking down and rotting wood. So when trees fell, that wood would just sit there and get buried... eventually time and pressure create coal</p>
<p>But then... some evolution happened. With wood sitting around, there was free food for the taking if some organism learned how to eat it. Eventually bacteria that could break down wood came to exist, and since it had plenty of food around, it did well. Today, a tree that falls will rot... because there is bacteria that developed around eating dead wood.</p>
<p>Plastic is relatively new. Just like trees were millions of years ago. And just like wood all those years ago, there is no bacteria specialized in breaking down plastic... so it doesn't rot. Yet.</p>
<p>It is likely that organisms will come to exist some day which thrive on breaking down plastics. But they need years and years and years of opportunity (trees.... or plastic sitting around) before something will coincidentally evolve to do it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is hard to describe it to a five-year-old, but it is an interesting question!</p>
<p>Some things are made of very tiny blocks we call &quot;atoms&quot;. Atoms are made of even smaller blocks, and depending on how those smaller blocks are arranged we call a big bunch of atoms &quot;an element&quot;. Iron is an element, so is Aluminum. They are made of a lot of atoms stuck together.</p>
<p>Chemistry has a set of rules about how atoms interact with each other. The rules sort of define a &quot;shape&quot; that atoms can have. Some shapes fit together and make big bunches of different atoms called &quot;molecules&quot;. For example, water is made out of atoms from the elements hydrogen and oxygen, and a water molecule has a kind of triangle shape. </p>
<p>Many metals have a shape that interacts in a weird way with oxygen atoms or molecules that have oxygen atoms in them. The atoms in the metal like to steal oxygen atoms from other things and make new molecules with that oxygen. For example, rust on most metals is actually what chemists call &quot;iron oxide&quot;, which means it's now a new molecule made out of iron and oxygen stuck together. Pretty much anything a chemist calls an &quot;oxide&quot; is something that's combined with oxygen and isn't the same anymore. Rusty things fall apart because iron atoms stick together a lot more strongly than iron oxide molecules do. So eventually, when a rusty thing has turned into enough rust, it's just a bunch of dust.</p>
<p>Aluminum and tin, which we usually make cans out of, are the same. They really like to form oxides, so they deteriorate pretty fast if they aren't kept very clean and dry. But they can even be deteriorated by the oxygen in the air! This is why we don't have an awful lot of cans from more than a few decades ago even though we've been making them for more than a century. It's too hard to keep these cheap, thin metals from deteriorating. We'd have to keep them in a vacuum!</p>
<p>Some metals, like stainless steel, have shapes that aren't so good at combining with oxygen. These metals don't really occur in nature, we make them in factories by combining metals together to get &quot;shapes&quot; of molecules that give us different combinations of strength, flexibility, and resistance to deterioration. Generally these metals have &quot;shapes&quot; that don't make it easy to make them thin or bendy enough to make cans, and since we have to combine metals to make them they're too expensive to make flimsy garbage with them.</p>
<p>We made plastic because we didn't like this. Plastic molecules are <em>really</em> complicated and designed so they don't really interact with many atoms found in nature. Since oxygen doesn't &quot;steal&quot; plastic molecules, it can go a very long time without deteriorating. I'm not exactly sure what causes it to deteriorate. I think it has to do with what kind of plastic is used. For example, plastic bags that are a few years old are brittle and break to pieces, but Tupperware from the 60s is still in pretty good shape. And even very strong plastic is very cheap compared to even flimsy metals. </p>
<p>So naturally, once we figured out how to make something cheap that never deteriorates, we proceeded to make everything we throw away out of it. A few people thought that might cause a problem, but we figured that's a problem five-year-olds like you can solve when you're a grownup, we won't be here anymore!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>ELI18:</p>
<p>There's Non-Volatile storage (A hard drive for example) and Volatile storage.</p>
<p>Non volatile storage is able to persistently store data by hard-writing it to for example a block in flash memory.</p>
<p>Volatile storage works more directly with electricity. Each bit has a capacitor, this is what makes up the data in RAM. These capacitors &quot;leak&quot; very very fast, and so when they lose power they will immediately leak until empty, where data is lost.</p>
<p>Programs use RAM to store data that may be used frequently, because using RAM is much faster than pulling from the hard drive. </p>
<p>Programs aren't perfect, and frequently make errors. It might store data it thinks it hasn't stored but it has,  creating memory leaks meaning things slow down because there's less memory.</p>
<p>Restarting the machine clears the RAM, and as such clears the errors the program has caused.</p>
<p>ELI5:</p>
<p>You have a sink. You wash the dishes every now and then.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a bit of food comes off and goes into the food filter at the plug hole, but the water still drains so it's okay.</p>
<p>Eventually there's too much food in the filter and the water is taking too long to drain. You pull out the filter and clean it, and the water now works fine.</p>
<p>The sink is your PC. The tap is a program. The water is data. The filter is memory. The food is programs making errors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's start with an analogy. I'm going over to my friend's house, but I don't know where he lives. My friend gives me directions, but he's not very good at giving directions and he doesn't really know the names of streets very well. So I'm supposed to &quot;go north on that one main road&quot; and then &quot;turn right at that big funny tree&quot;, &quot;go down about 3 or 4 stop signs&quot; and finally my friend lives &quot;2 doors down from the brown house&quot;. I hop in my car, do my best and...get lost. At this point, I could call my friend and try to get directions from wherever I am now (and I don't know where that is, exactly) or I could go back the way I came, go back to my house, and start over.</p>
<p>power-off is a known state for electronics, where RAM is cleared and the processor is not doing anything. The boot-up process is pretty well defined as well, with specific tasks happening in specific order. After that, things aren't well-defined. The system needs to respond to inputs which come at seemingly random times in seemingly random order. As these inputs are handled the system, assuming it's not perfectly designed, may start to become more and more disordered. Eventually, bugs start being triggered (there are, on average, between 15-50 bugs per 1000 lines of code depending on developer skill, and while many of these may be very minor, when you run long enough you're bound to trip over some of them).</p>
<p>Powering off and on again clears memory, removes the built-up disorder, and moves into a well-defined boot-up process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's usually state conflicts which are a result of bad programming. </p>
<p>For example, let's say that a device that can be connected to a computer and has a battery, like a camera, wireless mouse or a cellphone has these two states, &quot;connected&quot; and &quot;charging&quot;, each of which can be either true or false:</p>
<p>Let's make a table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: left;">deviceIsConnected</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">deviceIsCharging</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Makes sense</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">true</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">true</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Battery is full</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">true</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">false</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Doesn't make sense</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">false</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">true</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Makes sense</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">false</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">false</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now let's imagine that for some reason the device managed to get into a state where it thinks it's charging but not connected, which isn't possible. Maybe the user was fiddling with the cable, or there was some weird issue in the device's programming or in the hardware.</p>
<p>The programmer hasn't thought that this situation might ever occur so the program doesn't know where to go from here and it's basically broken.</p>
<p>A surefire way to fix it is to start from scratch by turning it off and on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
