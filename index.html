		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Food is usually heated prior to being filled into cans, but it doesn't have to be.  Once the can is filled it is sealed, then it is heat processed.  The severity of the heat process usually depends on the pH of the food.  Below a pH of 4.6 it can be pasteurised - given a heating process at 100°C or less.  </p>
<p>Foods above a pH of 4.6 are considered &quot;low acid&quot; foods.  Commercially canned low acid foods are heated to an equivalent of 121°C or 250°F to the centre of the food, for a minimum of 3 minutes (though usually longer). Because it takes a long time to heat the right through the food it will often take about an hour to process something like a can of baked beans at 121°C. This is done in a pressurised vessel called a retort. The pressure prevents the can from bursting or distorting and can allow the use of water for processing (though steam is also commonly used for heating the cans). This temperature and time combination is enough to kill the highly heat resistant spores of clostridium botulinum. If any survive the process they can reproduce and kill the consumer of the food. The legal minimum processing time for a canned food is designed to produce &quot;12 log&quot; reduction in the number of these spores, so if there's a single spore in the very middle of a can it'll have a 1 in 10^12 chance of surviving. Virtually zero.</p>
<p>This bacterium produces botulinum toxin (botox) the most lethal neurotoxin known.  Interestingly it doesn't need oxygen to grow, in fact it is actually an obligate anaerobe - it needs an absence of oxygen.  It prefers the absence of other bacteria, it doesn't produce gas as it grows (so cans don't swell indicating that something is wrong) and the spores often germinate after a significant heat treatment.  It's also the most heat resistant pathogen, which is why it is the target organism of the canning process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the food processing company (or home food preservationist) carefully kills all the germs inside the can either immediately before or immediately after it's sealed.</p>
<p>In home canning (which, if there were any justice in the world, would be called home jarring, because nobody uses metal cans at home, but there ain't no justice), you put your food- tomatoes, asparagus, jam, whatever- into a jar, seal up the jar, and then boil the jar, whole, for several minutes, until the jar and everything in it has been at boiling temperatures, killing any germs that might have been inside. Afterwards, there are no (live) germs inside to spoil the food, and since the jar is sealed, no germs from outside can get in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The food is put in the can, and then sealed before being sterilised to kill all of the bacteria that are present. </p>
<p>If there is any kind of leak on the seam, the bacteria are free to enter and the can,  can (in extreme cases) explode under the pressure of the increase in volume due to the bacteria.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physically, male humans develop slower because they are larger and more massive (mass wise) than females. Growing takes time, and growing too fast isn't good for the body.</p>
<p>Emotionally/intellectually this is more challenging. But it is a fact that women(girls) mature faster than men. Girls learn to &quot;prune&quot; information and generate more effective brain connections at an earlier age than boys. This means perhaps boys have longer to learn and form views and ideas on the world, but they take longer to do so.</p>
<p>Why is this? We're now onto a bit more speculation. In the wild, back when evolution was being selective, it was beneficial for girls to mature quickly so they can start reproducing (girls are the limiting resource in a populations growth rate much more than boys are, because men can have sex with multiple women) and in general the downsides for this (being smaller, perhaps being less creative or forming faster world-views) were acceptable.</p>
<p>However, men take the role of &quot;hunting&quot; or &quot;fighting&quot; (size needed for both). There was also probably typically more pressure on men to be innovative and different (in good and bad ways) due to the likely nature of early-human societies where women predominantly were suited to child care, and men were worth taking a &quot;risk&quot; on, due to them being more expendable. If you have 50 men and 50 women, and 30 of the men die because they experimented with something stupid, or because they were killed by an animal/other tribe, the tribe is still okay because the number of women determine how good the future is. But conversely, it is a bad evolutionary  idea if you design women to all be a bit nuts and reckless. </p>
<p>** - I sincerely hope I haven't offended anyone with the above, I am trying to be impartial.</p>
<p>In answer to your last question - in species were males are larger than females, yes males will grow slower.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's many reasons for this.</p>
<p>First and foremost is the fact that the fall of the western roman empire is a long and drawn out process during which time the economy needed for statue making was dwindling. If there's no one rich enough to buy a statue no one makes it. If no one makes it, no one learns how. And so the craft is forgotten in a generation or two.</p>
<p>But The roman empire didn't fall in 476, just the western part. in the east we can see similar styles up until the iconoclasm which is it's own mess. Unfortunately due to wars, ottoman dislike for statues and the iconoclasm, not many statues from them remain. So in the west people stopped making these natural lifelike arts because there wasn't enough money in it. Because everyone was poor. Because they were living in an &quot;almost post apocalyptic&quot; world of a fallen empire.</p>
<p>But to answer the important part of your question. Beauty is subjective to the society in which it is made. I.E, these paintings you see and feel are bad were not bad in the eyes of those that made it. </p>
<p>U/pinesap explains it very well here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1l1vp2/why_is_ancientmiddle_ages_art_is_technically_much/cbv3et1/?st=izh3hm9h&amp;sh=dae468f9" target="_blank">&quot;During the Middle Ages, the ideas that artists sought to depict were allegorical - the allegory a central form of medieval art and culture. The images created at that time were realistic as far as the ideas and cultural values they represented - they were not &quot;lacking&quot; in any skill. They served exactly the purpose they meant to fill, narrative, symbolic. The idea was not to represent reality, it was to transcend reality - and the point was that this was ideally to occur on the viewer's spiritual mind.&quot;</a></p>
<p>In other, simpler words: the people who made medieval art did not intend to do the same job as the roman and greek artists.  The People around them did not want grandiose, realistic, natural art. It didn't fit their view of the world.</p>
<p>It may seem strange to us now, but the fact is art usually reflects the values of them time. And at the time, storytelling was more important than realism. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>But I just wanted to point out that Roman sculpture wasn't reliably &quot;realistic&quot; either. Do you really think so many emperors and consuls were as buff/handsome/well-proportioned as their portraits suggest? Heck no. At least one of them had to have been a cross-eyed pudgy bald dude or something. Roman art was stylized, just in the opposite direction from Medieval art. They used realistic proportions for things like how long a person's arm should be in relation to their fingers, but they gave their subjects a heavily idealized musculature, weight, and facial structure that were unlikely to have been a reflection of anyone's actual body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe that good &quot;life-like&quot; quality in sculpture arose much earlier than in paining because when you are sculpting you are representing 3 dimensional objects in another 3 dimensional object. With painting however, you are trying to trick the observer into seeing 3 dimensional objects on a 2 dimensional surface. </p>
<p>If you look at Roman and Greek paintings (on pottery and such) it is also quite primitive from a modern perspective, just like early medieval paintings. Likewise, medieval sculptures were also not fundamentally different in complexity compared to Roman sculptures.</p>
<p>The big shift in European paintings from the silly-looking early stuff to proper three-dimensional representation using depth and such was a really big step!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the Roman Empire fell, it wasn't to another great civilization.  There are volumes of books written why Rome fell, but in the wake of its fall there was a total breakdown in the unity of Western Europe.  The Catholic Church was the only real remnant left of the Roman Empire (which had adopted Christianity before Rome fell.)  The artistic advancements that did not directly serve the Church were abandoned and largely forgotten.  It wasn't until the Renaissance (15th century) that Western Europe began to display a greater secularism as well as greater respect and interest in the arts.  Renaissance means &quot;rebirth&quot;, and the people of the Renaissance saw their time as a rebirth of the ancient glory of Rome/Greece.  They labeled the 1,000 years between their time and the fall of Rome as the &quot;middle&quot; ages (Medieval is Latin for middle ages.)  Some of the rediscovery of ancient artistic techniques was due to archaeological discoveries, and some of it was experimentation.  Opera came about because Italians thought that Ancient Greek theatre was entirely sung.  Michaelangelo and other great Renaissance artists were among the first to create on the dame level as the ancient Romans/Greeks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Roman art was inspired by Greek sculpture, painting, etc. which emphasized proportions, depth, and perspective. You have to remember that this was a period of high praise for mathematics and art itself and because the Greeks (and subsequently the Romans) were studying Euclidean geometry, their art thrived in terms of realism. As some others said, when the Roman Empire fell, Europe was thrown into the dark ages and all of this was lost until the Renaissance and specifically in painting, Giotto came onto the scene to revive perspective.</p>
<p>To add to that, the medieval style did not require realism. Much of it was mosaics for religious purposes and since its subjects were always religious figures it was ok for them to essentially break the laws of physics (e.g. Subjects appearing in more than one place in a medieval piece).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am not sure I can tell you why, but it is definitely a relatively new thing.   I am doing some work with a historian and she has a giant collection of documents from about 1600 up to the late 1800s all written by men (ship logs,  manifests,  trade and commerce and tax documents,  etc.) and virtually all of it is more legible than anything I see from first year university students.   </p>
<p>That suggests some substantial change in how we teach penmanship which has been bad for men/boys but either beneficial or no change for girls and women.  </p>
<p>The theory that we teach handwriting when girls are developing fine motor skills while boys are still doing gross motor skills makes the most sense.   Most guys I see can write legible math,  numerals (1, 2, 3 etc.) and then math symbols are taught at a different time than cursive writing and reinforced differently, so it may be that time context and reinforcement are big factors and simply moving when joined up writing is taught would fix it.   Though many of my students have told me they didn't learn cursive in school or their younger siblings aren't learning it.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read somewhere, that girls tend to achieve fine motor control earlier than boys, so when they hit school age, girls tend to already be quite good with hand eye coordination and the like, while boys still struggle.
Since you don't really practice neat writing after a certain age boys will mostly be stuck with a messy Handwriting.
(Same is true for children with neurodevelopment disorders that delay the development of motorskills)</p>
<p>On the other hand I guess it's also partly because you expect girls to be neater, so they are pushed more towards improving their handwriting.</p>
<p>Edit:
did a Google search on the motor skills development.. tho most non scientific sites agree with me, most research I found doesn't find a statistically significant difference between fine or gross motor skills in preschoolers.
But from what people comment I'd say in personal experience it seems overwhelmingly that girls invest more time in their handwriting in a young age/consciously change their writing style/etc.
Not sure, if its biological or societal.. tho I personally would lean towards the later (girls are pushed towards being neat and liking pretty things, while boys might get teased for valuing &quot;pretty things&quot;. I mean, it might turn them gay, right? ;) )</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see all these comments suggesting biology as the driving cause, but I suspect social pressures are much more relevant. Personally, I was always one of the best artists in my relatively small school, particularly at the young age when we were learning to write. Nevertheless, my handwriting is ugly. That said, I can write neatly if context calls for it, and I suspect that's true for a lot of those with bad handwriting. We can write neatly, we just don't care to and haven't practiced doing so enough to do it expediently.  </p>
<p>I also have some objection to the premise. I graded papers for a class of 500+ for a couple years, and I found that I was not able to reliably guess a students gender based on their handwriting. Roughly 30% of my students were international though, but that just reinforces that any disparity is probably socially driven. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, humans are not the only the only animals that use ketone bodies.</p>
<p>Ketone bodies are a normal metabolite within lipolysis, ketogenesis and ketosis (burning fats from your fat tissue) and a great deal of what we know about lipid (fat) metabolism was derived from rat and mouse experiments. So at the very least ketones as fuel existed in the joint ancestor of all mammals, millions and millions of years before the first primates existed.</p>
<p>But it likely goes back much further.</p>
<p>Consider also that when many animals sleep they make use of their fat stores to maintain energy homeostasis. Pretty much all animals with nervous systems engage in sleep or a sleep-like process. So lipolysis and ketone utilisation likely goes back at least as far as the joint ancestor of all chordate animals. And it likely goes back even further than that as lipid metabolism <em>in toto</em> is a key pillar of keeping cells functioning</p>
<p>Here's a paper from 1979 on ketone body metabolism in fish</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1161766/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1161766/</a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think this rumor comes from human brains being able to adapt the largest percent of brain tissue to using ketones when in a state of ketosis. This probably has less to do with ketosis being more appropriate for humans than other animals and more to do with the unique makeup of our brains and unusually large cerebral cortex. I'm not aware of any research, but I'd be willing to bet dolphin brains use more ketones than ours. Other hunting carnivores that can't use ketones as well have to shift their brains and metabolism in general to a low energy state called hibernation to survive the winter. Whereas humans and some others can maintain a high energy state via ketones and continue to hunt through the winter. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<blockquote>
<p>Glucose is the only fuel normally used by brain cells. Because neurons cannot store glucose, they depend on the bloodstream to deliver a constant supply of this fuel. Fatty acids do not serve as fuel for the brain, because they are bound to albumin in plasma and so do not traverse the blood-brain barrier. In starvation, ketone bodies generated by the liver partly replace glucose as fuel for the brain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All cells in the human body can use glucose, FFA and ketones for energy, the brain however almost exclusively uses glucose.  During a fed state the brain will use 20-25% of total body glucose </p>
<p>During starvation and ketosis that number will jump up to 70% of total body glucose is used by the brain. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<li>Check prescriptions for &quot;drug related problems&quot; such as interactions. In my experience, pharmacists tend to be overly cautious people. So yes, we will run certain drug combos through our computer, or glance at the patient hand-out to &quot;double check&quot; ourselves-this is a good thing. Sometimes I need to remind myself of a drug I haven't seen in a long time! Once we get the information we can interpret its severity quickly, which a lay person could not. As others have pointed out, there are tons of interactions that get &quot;flagged&quot; and a pharmacist is able to determine which is important based on the individual patient. For example, I have prevented very serious problems by contacting doctors over a dangerously high dose of antibiotics in a child, or a drug interaction that was only meaningful because it was for a frail elderly lady. This is a pharmacist's job-doctors are trained for diagnosis, not drug interactions.  </li>
<li>I help people understand their medications. For example, the man who just had a heart attack and is leaving the hospital overwhelmed with a pile of meds. Without me they usually will stop taking one or two (or go back to smoking, or try a over-the-counter snake oil instead) and be at risk for a second heart attack. I sit down with them, and based on their personal needs talk about the risks vs benefits of the meds. Then I call them in a few days and follow up, making sure they've made an appointment with their family doctor. Or, I do a medication reconciliation with an elderly woman who has too many medications with side effects, and work with her doctor to see if some can be stopped.  </li>
<li>I answer people's questions 24 hours a day with more accuracy and clarity than google. (We are open extended hours) For example- its 2 AM and someone comes in with a sick child: what medication do they use? Should they go to the ER? This saves the healthcare system (or you, if you're American) money.  </li>
<li>I give flu shots which saves the government money as they pay us less than doctors, and the patient time. I also give other vaccinations, such as hepatitis B, so if you're going to Mexico you can be protected without the need for extra doctor visits.  </li>
<li>I prescribe certain medications for minor conditions, again saving the healthcare system money and the patient time.  </li>
<li>I can change some prescriptions with the patient's ok, for example if a product isn't available or something is missing from the prescription.  </li>
<li>I specialty make a lot of drugs, for example certain seizure medication for children isn't sold in liquid form- I will make this for you at 3AM when you realize you are completely out of doses for your kid.  </li>
<li>I dispense and monitor methadone, helping former addicts come off narcotics and re-integrate back in society (in partnership with their awesome nurses.)  </li>
<li>I deal with insurance agencies to try to get medications covered, sometimes contacting your doctor to see if an alternate drug would be acceptable.  </li>
<li>I consult on the phone with doctors, nurses, homecare workers etc deciding what course of action would be in the best interest of the patient.  </li>
<li>I use math calculations to be able to figure out the correct dose of things like Tylenol for infants too small to be listed on the box, again at 2 AM. Or help someone self-adjust their insulin.  </li>
<li>I get annoyed when someone is yelling at me from across the counter wondering why their order isn't done yet, asking what the heck I do all day. ;)<br />
TL;DR: Pharmacist's are drug therapy experts who can help you take charge of your health and decide if a certain medication is right for you. Like any profession there are a few dumb/lazy ones out there- but most of us work our butts off to keep you safe!</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a nurse in a hospital, and pharmacists do a lot. They dose medication for patients whose liver or kidneys aren't functioning properly (meaning they're not able to clear the meds out of their system like a usual person would) and dose especially toxic medicines based on lab results. Lots of meds my patients get come with a physician order stating &quot;Pharmacy to dose&quot; bc the pharmacists are experts in how the drug works in and is processed by the body. They figure out alternate ways of getting a medicine into a patient when the usual ways aren't working, like when the patient needs a pill but chokes on everything they try to swallow, or need an IV drug but don't have an IV for whatever reason, because they have the knowledge to compare different methods if the same drug or alternate drugs that can go in a different way. They also double check medicine compatibility and dosage, which seems like a computer could do, but gets complicated when you have patients on many drugs being used in non-standard dosages for different conditions. They also physically mix the drugs, which requires a lot of knowledge of the chemistry of the body in order to ensure the med is safe to give and being given correctly. They're also in charge of a lot of the facets of making sure med errors don't happen. Pharmacists are experts on the drugs, so the doctor can focus on treating the patient, instead of reinventing the wheel. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pharmacists are experts in medications, even more so that doctors. Doctors are responsible for a lot of information and decisions, done quickly. Under those circumstances, it can be easy to order medications that are incompatible in the same patient. One of their chief responsibilities is to make sure medication orders make sense, drug interactions are minimized, doses are appropriate, and so on.<br />
That makes it sound like they're only purpose is to doublecheck Dr.'s work, but in truth they tend to have a much more in-depth knowledge of the field of medications, their effects, and their doses.</p>
<p>There's a lot more to it than that. The stuff you see them doing is counting to make sure the right number of pills get into your prescription. It gets much more difficult when there are multiple prescriptions on the same patient. Also sometimes doctors need doses that don't exist in pill form. In these cases it's up to the pharmacist to make a new pills, or capsules, or syrup liquids, in order to make the doses precise. </p>
<p>For example, let's say there is an antibiotic that is only available in  200 mg tablets. A doctor needs syrup made up to give to a baby that has 75 mg in 1 teaspoon. A pharmacist has the technical expertise and know how to mix the syrup with the pills that are available. They really are an indispensable part of the care team.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also a blood banker.  Separated into it's components, some parts last 5 days, some last 42 days, some can be frozen for a year, some can be frozen for ten years and manufactured into other products.  We're always looking at ways to extend shelf life.  We're pretty crazy about inventory efficiency too, but expired product (usually only group AB red blood cells, or excess platelets which only last 5 days and are harder to manage) are biomedical waste or research material.  Biomedical waste goes for incineration.  (Edit:  So, Group AB, please donate plasma and platelets if you can.  Group O people, stick with the whole blood.  That way, we can maximize the usefulness of your gift!)</p>
<p>Edit, again: For all those who are asking &quot;I'm type (letter/Rh), what should I do?&quot; the answer to the question is always changing.  Inventory fluctuates and we can get short on any group at any time, so ask your local blood bank, or answer the phone when they call. :)  </p>
<p>In my geographic area, we might collect about 300 units of blood in a day.  Let's say 7 percent are O negative type, as is the case in North America.  That's 21 units.  A single major trauma or bleeding event can use 40 units of blood.  (That's the extreme, though)  Just some perspective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The report states that only about 4% of donated blood (in Scotland in 2015) is destroyed due to expiring, although some more was lost because of mistakes and faults in handling it.</p>
<p>If there is a surplus of a certain blood type, blood donation centres simply won't call in those donors as often to reduce the amount of blood that must be disposed of. This has been the case for AB+ women, because AB+ blood can only be transfused into other AB+ persons but AB+ recipients can take any of the common blood types. Plasma from AB women who have ever been pregnant can cause problems for the recipient too.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sound is effectively just waves of air moving at different speeds and sizes. While most of them are so small you can really only sense them with your ears, as you start to get really low, the waves start to get a lot bigger, to the point you can actually feel them. That feeling is the air physically vibrating your body, usually with what's called a ground sub. Some Front of House Engineers do this on purpose to get that &quot;concert feel&quot;, and the wavelengths that do it best are actually below your threshold of hearing, in terms of pitch, but can be powerful enough to knock even a grown person over.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is infrasonics which are frequencies that hit your body like percussion waves and they are low enough in frequency that you feel as much as hear. Although in a rock concert situation it's more about the power than simply being a low note. </p>
<p>For instance firing a pistol also kicks you in the chest with the sound wave but that isn't an infrasonic sound, but it has infrasonics in it as it's noise IE a range of different frequencies. The lower the pitch the more energy it takes in order to make the sound travel. </p>
<p>To put it another way, high frequency sound are like feathers. It doesn't take much to make them float through the air. Lower notes are like bricks, you can make them fly through the air but it needs a lot more power to do so, and if you catch one in the chest, you're going to feel it. </p>
<p>Or to coin another analogy, when it comes to light you have infrared which are like the bass notes of light, and you have ultraviolet, which are like the high frequency sounds of light. While the high frequency can carry a lot of energy, like xrays and UV light, the lower frequencies can carry a lot of power, like getting burned from standing too close to a bon fire and the infrared radiation actually burns you from the light. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

What you're feeling are very large (low-pitch bass) pressure waves flowing through the air and through you.  Your chest has a lot of mass, therefore, will absorb a lot of the wave as it hits you compared to your ligaments.  The more you absorb, the more you feel.  These waves are literally jostling your insides!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
