Basically our brain loves trying to predict the next note, next verse, when the chorus will hit, etc. and the brain releases endorphins (feel good signals) every time it either guesses a new pattern correctly or is pleasantly surprised by a brand new sound.</p>
<p>The more we listen to a song, especially on repeat, the less surprises the song will hold and easier the patterns are to predict or remember.</p>
<p>Fun fact: this is also why if you get a song stuck in your head listening to the entire song 2-3 times in a row will usually get it out of your head.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Music perception is a huge field that includes physics, math and psychology / biologists amongst others. One explained it to me like this (Im sure this is a simplification): Music has a tension between repetition and dissonance. Repetition makes the music accessible, catchy and fun. Dissonance makes it thoughtful, interesting and deep. Some music tilts strongly in one direction: repetitive dance music, others in a different direction: like experimental jazz. As you get more and more familiar with a genre, some of the repetition and patterns “unlock” for you and become accessible in a way that they may not be to a novice. If you COMPLETELY process the information it will likely bore you. However if you dont “Get IT” youll likely dismiss the song as inaccessible and offputting. This tension explains both why albums and songs get better with age and why some dont. It also explains in part why some complex music (jazz and classical or even metal and hiphop) have die hard fans while others seem to hate it or just not get it. It turns out some of musical appreciation is actually tied to exposure. The best songs “grow” with you, looping in to patterns you can already access and then “unlocking” different more involved ones as you go. If you add a layer of emotional tie during that process (ahem - first kiss, birth of a child, loss of a loved one) this adds another layer that may or may not actually interact with all of the above. Perception is awesome!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi there! So, this is really a macro/microbial ecology question. And there are no simple answers as to “which and how many” organisms you’ll find. This is because the living and organic composition of your soil is so, so dependent on location, history (or hysteresis as we like to call it), and culture (I.e., human intervention in the soil). </p>
<p>It is not a very satisfying answer, but I can provide some general rules of thumb for what you might find at that level of magnification:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>lots of fungal hyphae, some larger, multicellular (resistant) spores (such as <em>Fusarium</em>), and tons of bacterial films/mats/agglomerates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nematodes, trematodes, other -todes, and lots and lots and lots of itty bitty worms: thread, flat, segmented, carnivorous, herbivorous, microbiophores (pretty sure I made that one up but I like it), etc. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if it’s well tended, aerated soil with lots of organic matter and a balanced pH for your area, you are likely to find significantly more visible critters than otherwise</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you’ll never see anywhere close to “everything,” or even a bit, of what is there: you’ll be missing (at 100x mirror or even underlit) most single-cell organisms, hyperparasites, viruses, sessile organisms that look like detritus, and etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>much of what you see (especially the fungi, alga, and bacterial microfilms/mats) will be made by organisms that are undescribed in the scientific literature (see ^1 below)</p>
</li>
<li>the greatest diversity will be in the top 4-20cm  of soil, where aeration and compaction should be ideal and organic matter is higher. </li>
</ul>
<p>Soil, plant, and microbial scientists have been examining soils since microscopes (and hand lenses) were invented. Most productive exploration done these days is using environmental DNA studies in soil and aquatic environments. </p>
<p>————————————</p>
<p>^1 One of my first PhD projects involved isolating fungi living inside the stems of grasses. From a very small number of individuals of one species of invasive annual grass, we isolated more than 1,000 distinct colonies of culturable-filamentous fungi and yeasts. We could identify less than 10% to genus, about 10 actual colonies to species (only because they are known plant pathogens), and when we ran PCR on the whole shebang we got up to about 15% identification to family/genus for culturalable fungi. That was probably about 75% of the actual fungi (many aren’t able to be cultured or isolated in a lab), none of the bacteria, etc. </p>
<p>There were also three species of nematode and some other worms. Inside the stem of a small grass a couple of mm in diameter. </p>
<p>Tl;dr: The soil In your garden is the final (biological) frontier. We don’t know much about what is in it, but I’d be willing to bet there is a lot going on. And as a research scientist in that field, I wouldn’t even be able to identify most of what you’ll see under a microscope without a lot of work, a bunch of manuals, a budget for PCR and running some phylogenetic models, and a fully outfitted microbiology laboratory. But you should definitely look, and be amazed!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With 40-100x magnification you can see a lot more than you'd think. Speaking from my college Soil Science lab experience in USA, a small sample of soil diluted in some water and placed on a microscope slide can reveal lots of different species. Rotifers, nematodes, and various arthropods should be visible. In a small bit of water you can see them move more easily. You'll likely find lots of plant and fungi material. Also at 100x magnification you should start to see bacteria appearing as small indistinguishable dots. Have fun!</p>
<ul>
<li>The most fun in my opinion was to see how they move and behave, i've watched micros cannibalize each other and others come on contact and quickly avoid each other.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I took an ecology course in college. Day 3 or 4 of the semester, everybody brought in a handful of soil from our homes and threw it into a large Rubbermaid filled with shredded newspaper. Over the course of the semester, we were able to add in any biodegradable organic material (a lot of the food stuffs had to be frozen overnight first, to combat flies). By the end of the semester, the bin was full of deep rich black soil. We each took a small amount and analyzed it under magnification and logged the number of critters we could see. So many. It was a lower level class, so it was a quantitative analysis as opposed to a qualitative, but such a cool experiment. It’s been 20-something years, but I’ll never forget it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our legs and knees bear a lot of stress due to our walking upright. The muscles in our upper leg are the biggest and most powerful in the body.</p>
<p>The quadriceps muscle is responsible for extending the leg - when it contracts, it pulls on the tendon that runs over the front of our knee, which extends our lower leg.</p>
<p>This tendon runs more or less right over the kneecap. What the kneecap does is act as a fulcrum - it moves the tendon away from the knee joint's point of rotation, just a little, but enough to provide a significant mechanical advantage. It actually makes the quadriceps muscle about 30% more powerful than it would be without it.</p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XnYO4TnpTCo" target="_blank">Here's a YouTube video showing how it works.</a></p>
<p>As we generally don't walk around on our hands, our elbows need no such mechanical advantage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

These bones are held in place through ligaments to prevent front, back and side movements to keep the bone in place. Your knee joint is actually quite an unstable joint in your lower limb, which has to support the weight of your body, which is why it needs more protection. In your elbow joint, there are two connections to the humerus (upper arm bone); one of these has a hook like end (ulna/forearm bone) which is very stable. Also, the elbow doesn’t often bear a lot of weight compared to the knee. Hope that’s clear!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There could many, many, many reasons why fatigue sets in the more people age. They do overlap making it a question that can be unique to each individual. </p>
<p>Lifestyle- As we age life becomes more demanding and stressful. We get jobs, go to school, start families and form more complex social lives and adopting energy consuming roles in society. On average, children and teenagers have a lot less to worry about in terms of stress than someone who has the above mentioned established. That's why it is important to rest when stressed and get sleep in. Yes, diet, exercise and hydration influence fatigue, lol.</p>
<p>Biology- Genes can be triggered or damaged over a person's lifetime to affect so many aspects of their functioning. Things like hormones and genetic diseases can affect a person's fatigue as they grow older. Some hormones that influence sleep actually decrease as we age. This explains why sleep is vital for development and why the elderly tend to be more restless. </p>
<p>Mental/Psychological- Depression, stress, trauma boredom, and other forms of psychological states can affect a person's energy levels. Depression can not only leave a person with crushing fatigue but it may also reduce the quality of sleep.</p>
<p>There are so many things influencing our energy levels that it is always important to check in with professionals depending on your needs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The surface of bubbles is shiny, it reflects light. When you make foam, you’re making lots and lots of little bubbles. Since lots of bubbles have more surface area than one single bubble, it means more light can get reflected so your foam looks white. </p>
<p>Same thing happens if you’ve ever seen people make pulled taffy. They start out with a dark mixture and it gets lighter in colour as they fold and pull it because they’re incorporating bubbles.
They keep their colour because there’s more dye in it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Size does play a role. But, in general, the big difference is between enveloped and non-enveloped viruses.</p>
<p>Some viruses have a capsid that is surrounded by a fatty &quot;envelope.&quot; Fats, or more precisely here lipids, are more susceptible to disruption by things like soap, acid, or alcohol. If the envelope is destroyed, the virus is no longer able to infect cells. This is why many viruses that infect your gut (and have to survive your stomach acid) are non-enveloped.</p>
<p>The composition of the capsid or envelope also plays a role. Embedded in the envelope are proteins that can confer stability. Stomach acid will destroy many envelopes, but some are protected by protein &quot;reinforcements,&quot; as it were.</p>
<p>The size of an envelope also affects stability. Smaller particles will have higher curvature, a physical property. High curvature can reduce the stability of envelopes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I think it has to do with capsid composition, viral load, and lung infection. After all you're not likely to breathe out an infection that targets the gut. Viral load I think is a factor because that's just &quot;It's everywhere and trillions of them.&quot;   </p>

<p>The tl/dr is that yes, the shiny side does technically reflect heat, but that only affects heat from radiation.  The VAST majority of heat when cooking in an oven is through convection (heat transferred through the air).

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Global Contraction Theory is also referred to as Geophysical Global Cooling Theory, involves a planet in a molten state gradually cooling as it ages. First the surface cools to a solid rock state as the mantle and core cool at a slower rate, the interior cooling shrinks the rock and so the crust has to shrink and crumple around it.</p>
<p>This does happen in other places in the solar system, like Mercury or the Moon, as their crusts are not broken up into plates and are instead one solid surface. However because Earth has plate tectonics each plate can slide over or under each other as the Earth loses heat and the interior shrinks. This means that although the earth is losing heat very very slowly and is therefor contracting the impact on the crust is negligible at best.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sure! As you already mentioned (and as other commenters have helpfully reiterated) contraction is not the <em>main</em> force shaping the Earth's surface. But that doesn't mean it's irrelevant. </p>
<p>To see a possible example of contractional tectonics, you need to go to the seafloor. In the middle of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, new ocean crust is <a href="https://atmos.eoas.fsu.edu/~odom/ESC1000/tectonics/tpb.html" target="_blank">constantly being generated</a> along long volcanic mountain ranges called mid-ocean ridges. These mid-ocean ridges are associated with large numbers of parallel transform faults, the most common and most active faultlines on Earth. For example, see the dark lines in <a href="https://atmos.eoas.fsu.edu/~odom/ESC1000/tectonics/images/transf.jpg" target="_blank">this image</a>. Seriously look at that picture and think about the huge moutnains and canyons down there. There's so much stuff happening at the bottom of the ocean!</p>
<p>These transform faults relieve strain in oceanic crust. Most of that strain probably comes from differences in how fast different parts of the crust are moving relative to each other. Transform faults allow those different sections to slide past each other, relieving the strain.</p>
<p>Maybe contraction still plays a role? Since the new oceanic crust is warmer than the old crust, it's also less dense. Cooling the crust shrinks it, and shrinking causes strain. Contractional faults would relieve that strain.</p>
<p>What's the evidence? Some of the seafloor faults have <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2002GL015612" target="_blank">zero offset (PDF warning)</a>, indicating contraction not sliding. The fault-lines are <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JB091iB06p06405" target="_blank">regularly spaced</a> like you would expect with cooling cracks. Finally, there are many earthquakes in these faults close to the spreading centers, and few further away, which <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JB079i017p02573" target="_blank">would be weird</a> if they were only relieving lateral stress.</p>
<p>I don't think that there is a consensus about whether these seafloor faults are (partially) thermal cracks or not. See <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/329/5995/1047" target="_blank">this paper</a> for example, which explains some of the anomalies I pointed out with a purely non-contractional model (but also calls them &quot;deeply enigmatic&quot;). The ocean is deep, and tectonics is complicated! However, I think that it's likely that, if only in a small way, contraction influences the way the crust breaks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people are making some decently rational arguments about consent, but those are fundamentally nothing more than rationalizations of an irrational system and do not actually answer your question. </p>
<p>It is only unacceptable because our culture has deemed it so. The reasons for this vary, but will all boil down to control and shame. Both which suck. </p>
<p>It’s important to note that this isn’t universal. Here in Germany it is pretty common for people to swim and sunbath nude, in swimsuits, or underwear. Nudity and the human body are not considered sexual 100% of the time. Thus “unacceptable” means something very different depending on culture and context. </p>
<p>If you want to know how we got here though, well that is a pretty long history lesson of cultural modesty standards. It’s all unnecessary and fucked up though, so feel free to disregard them and do what makes you comfortable. Don’t feel pressured to be wear to many or to few clothes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>TL:DR - humans are hard wired to conform to social expectations- even bizarre ones that make no logical sense.</strong></p>
<p>It’s about context and learned social acceptability, not about confidence or body image:</p>
<p>We learn through experience and normative conformity that different kinds of attire are acceptable in different social situations.</p>
<p>We learn that the only situations in which our underwear is on display to other people are limited to communal changing rooms and intimacy in the bedroom.</p>
<p>We learn that there are limited situations to wear a ball gown, a hockey goalkeeping kit, scuba diving gear...</p>
<p>When we see people in certain clothes we make assumptions directly related to what they are wearing: a guy in a tux is travelling to or from a formal event. A girl in her underwear is stripping off or getting dressed.</p>
<p>We don’t <em>know</em> where the guy in the tux Is going - our brains just jump to that conclusion. We don’t walk around wearing only our underwear because we know people will Unconsciously make conclusions.</p>
<p>The situational context is what matters. Take, for example, going topless at the beach. Some societies see this as normal but would be mortified if you stand up and walk 20 yards inland. And nobody does it. Why not? It’s not because of fear of arrest for indecency; it’s for a far more compelling reason: humans are hard wired to conform to social expectations- even bizarre ones that make no logical sense.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s not about men and women. Not sure why you would make this statement without thinking this out. Why make it just about women?</p>
<p>A guy can wear trunks or a speedo, but boxer briefs or whitey tighties would be just inappropriate as a woman wearing underwear to the beach. It’s cuz underwear is not designed to be outer wear. It just has a different emotion tied to it. Just like wearing pajamas in public is odd. You don’t see people at the grocery story in bathrobes and nighties.</p>
<p>Also, underwear is much thinner and not made for water. It would sag, come off, be see through etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s because a bikini is beach wear. It’s a garment designed for wearing outside. </p>
<p>Think of it like this. You can wear your pyjamas outside (it covers up your body the same way that regular clothes do), but people usually don’t, because you’re not considered dressed if you wear pyjamas.</p>
<p>The same logic applies to wearing underwear on the beach. Women <em>can</em> but usually don’t because those garments are not considered outside clothing. </p>
<p>Also you can’t swim in most underwear, it gets wet, becomes see through, and doesn’t hold water well. This is not an issue with a bikini.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some posts are explaining the different type of excretion from armpit glands,  but what must be taken into consideration is that your armpits are not open to air, which greatly increases the rate at which they begin to emit a bad odor. This is why your feet and nether regions also begin to smell bad before other parts of your body.  The bacteria is trapped and moist. The rest of your skin is exposed to airflow which let's it dry out, greatly reducing bacteria growth. </p>
<p>For example,  you mention that back sweat does not smell bad.  Have you ridden in a car with leather seats on a hot day for a long time? Even without leather seats,  back sweat can begin to smell really bad on long,  hot car rides. I can take a shower,  get in my car,  drive an hour and the back of my shirt is soaked and stinky.  Like, real stinky.  I use one of those beaded seat covers that allow increased airflow to alleviate this. </p>
<p>It is not so much the different types of sweat the glands emit as it is the restriction of airflow that keeps those areas moist, which allows faster bacteria growth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
