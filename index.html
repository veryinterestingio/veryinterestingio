<p>But Baikal???</p>
<p>The Baikal critters are perched way up at almost half a km altitude and almost 1500 km from the closest coast (the Okhotsk sea).</p>
<p>I don't get it...</p>
<p>And if it happened in Baikal, why not in other large freshwater lakes such as lake Superior, Great Bear lake <del>or even lake Ladoga</del>?</p>
<p>EDIT: thanks to /u/Gsdthrowaway1 for bringing the lake Ladoga seals to my attention. But these are still landlocked seals in a place that makes sense : a low-lying lake in a flat area prone to isostatic rebound within spitting distance of the sea.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I once came across <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2010/06/15/most-inconvenient-seal/" target="_blank">this article</a> that tackled this very question. Even though the article is written for a broader audience, its author is an expert in the field (and it's well sourced to boot). The gist is that at present (at least as of a few years ago) there was no clear consensus. Instead, there were two key hypotheses about where the Baikal seals came from.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Seals from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratethys" target="_blank">Paratethys</a>, that huge ass sea in southern Eurasia tens of millions of years ago, could have wondered north reaching what is now Lake Baikal. Just how exactly that could have happened is quite spotty since it would have required the seals hopping through multiple rivers and lakes across a long distance.</p>
</li>
<li>Alternatively, the seals could have moved north to south from the Arctic. Essentially the idea is that the seals would have moved down through the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Yeniseirivermap.png" target="_blank">Yensei/Angara Rivers.</a> eventually reaching the waters that formed Lake Baikal.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since this is not my field I am not sure if there has been any new research on this topic that may give a more conclusive answer. But it sure is a fascinating question!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Marine mammal paleontologist here: it's a subject of debate in the literature, and to be clear, my focus is typically on walruses (Odobenidae) and sea lions (Otariidae) but I have dabbled in true seal phylogeny/paleontology (Phocidae). </p>
<p>Phocinae - specifically the Phocina tribe (Pusa + Phoca - Baikal/ringed/caspian seals + harbor/spotted seals, respectively) are a relatively recent, completely post-Paratethys diversification (likely during the Pliocene). The whole Paratethys idea is bunk and based on some rather antiquated Ukraine/USSR/eastern Bloc-centric ideas of seal evolution from the 60s/70s (Chapskii, Grigorescu, 'reanimated' by Koretsky).</p>
<p>My own preferred hypothesis, and I hope this is covered in the literature (if not I've got an easy paper to write!), is that these seals colonized the Caspian Sea and Lake Baikal via the West Siberian Glacial Lake during the Pleistocene - a huge pond of meltwater at the edge of the Siberian ice sheet. This would have been semiconnected to the ocean by rivers of meltwater. Our own Great Lakes are the remnants of these lakes around the perimeter of the former Laurentide ice sheet (though the ground is depressed due to glacial isostasy - literally, the weight of the ice sheet compressed/depressed the earth's crust). Matter of fact, the Champlain Sea (now only lake Champlain) in New York/Vermont/Ontario/Quebec is now mostly dry but deposits of this glacial 'sea' are rich in now-Arctic marine mammals (beluga, ringed seal, walrus, etc.).</p>
<p>So yes, technically a seal could swim up a river nowadays but during certain periods of the Pleistocene it was much easier owing to the vast lakes of meltwater along the edge of the ice sheet - just like the Champlain sea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

As much I've continued to follow this story, it does seem like the hypothesis that they come from the Arctic (as referenced in this article and by several other comments) seems to be the most supported. Not sure of Baikal's history, but in the Caspian, the rough timing of the separation of the Caspian seal from its source population corresponds with a massive highstand (the Akchagylian stage for any Caspian chronostratigraphy buffs out there) in Caspian sea level where the mapped extents of deposits reach near (but don't quite get to the) Arctic ocean. The base-level history of these internally drained lakes (e.g. Caspian, Baikal, Aral, etc) can get real wacky, the Caspian for example had base level variations in excess of 1 km <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018213002836" target="_blank">(e.g. this paper I wrote a few years back assembling a sea-level curve for the Caspian)</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how a new sliding window slides really well for (x) amount of time? Then maybe it starts to get a little stuck, so you spray some WD 40 or whatever, and now your window slides easily, and you're like &quot;sweet, I didn't have to deal with the real problem of putting in new windows, because these are good as new!&quot; Then after a few months, that window is sticking again so you throw some more WD 40 on it and it works again, and you're like &quot;great! Well hopefully this doesnt become a more frequent thing I have to continuously do in order for my window to function correctly!&quot; And then the next month you have to WD 40 it again, then in two weeks, then a week, few days, etc.
The window is now reliant on the WD 40 to perform the simple task of opening, but now it even sticks sometimes even after using a whole can. Let's say it was a wood window... the reason it worked pre-WD 40 is because it was treated. After introducing the WD 40 to the wood, the wood started to dry out- what have you - even more/faster. Or we could say that the WD 40 reacted to whatever the window was treated with, so the window now no longer functions the way it did in the beginning, and it is not physically possible for it to complete the task of opening.
However, if we take these broken windows, and sand them down/re-seal them, the WD 40 is no longer needed, and contingent on daily maintenance, the windows will never need it again.
That was a really stupid analogy, but it breaks down to how alcohol and your brain work. This coming from an alcoholic who kept such an astronomically high BAC that when I tried to go in to my third residential treatment sober, at 16 hours without a drink or drug, was withdrawling to the point of hallucination and severe DT's, only to find out I was still at a .33 BAC... four times the legal limit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Microwaves don't radiate your food, as many believe, they simply excite water molecules which then transfer that energy (in the form of heat) to the rest of your food. This is therefore a fairly innocuous cooking method, and other than warming it up / denaturing proteins it isn't going to do an awful lot to your food. It's also pretty good for preserving micronutrient content for this reason.</p>

The only difference between cooking with microwaves or IR light is how far it penetrates different material. Microwave frequency is chosen due to a useful mix between penetration and absorbtion which causes heat. If you go higher, it penetrates materials better but less is absorbed so less heat is generated. Go lower and more energy is absorbed but it penetrates much less so the surface layers get really hot but deeper down it remains cold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add on to the other comments here, the oxidizing agent in gunpowder (potassium nitrate, commonly called saltpeter [thank you /u/CaptMercaptan], is used in traditional black powder) is what enables the explosion at all. The speed of a combustion reaction depends on the availability of heat, fuel (reducing agent) and oxygen (oxidizing agent). </p>
<p>In most cases, like a bonfire, oxygen is the limiting reagent. The fire spreads slowly because the logs burn up all the oxygen right around them, and new oxygen only flows to the fire so fast. That's why you can blow on a fire to make it bigger, because you're helping more oxygen-rich air replace the oxygen-poor air that is right around the logs. Also, the logs can only burn on their outmost layers, because the inside of the log can't get any oxygen.</p>
<p>In an explosion, the fuel and oxygen react with each other almost instantaneously. In order to do that, they have to be evenly mixed so that every bit of fuel has enough oxygen available to it. In a car engine, this is done by spraying a small amount of gas into a chamber with fresh air to make a mist of gas and air. When the sparkplug adds an ignition source, it explodes, and the huge surge in pressure makes your piston expand. </p>
<p>In gunpower, this mixture of fuel and oxygen comes from the sulfur and charcoal (fuel) being mixed in the right ratio with the KNO_3, which can donate it's oxygen atoms. That lets the combustion happen fast enough to launch a bullet at the speed of sound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Long answer: H2O is remarkable stable and wants to stay that way. H2O2 is still stable, but it will give the extra oxygen atom to any compound that it can, so it can be more stable. Unlucky for living things, cell membranes will end up taking this extra oxygen and they will no longer be able to hold their form.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>WOOOOOW literally every one of these answers are wrong.</p>
<p>H2O2 does not kill cells with a free O atom going about grabbing up different things. In fact free O molecules happen all the time thanks to our Electron transport chain. It just bonds with H and creates water. The molecular structure of H2O2 is H-O-O-H, with those dashes being bonds. The middle bond is where the hydrogen peroxide breaks into two components producing 2 OH molecules. Now OH isn't bad. In fact our body is full of OH- molecules. Water is constantly losing and gaining hydrogen. This gives a mixture in pure water of H2O molecules, HO- molecules and H3O+ molecules. This is the whole bases for the pH system (p=-log: 14= -log[H] + -log[HO-]). So why does H2O2 kill? The answer is quite radical! (you'll see what I did there in a second)</p>
<p>When H2O2 breaks they create two OH radicals. A radical is any molecule with an odd number of electrons. So their is one unpaired electron in it. Molecules/Atoms HATE this. In the body biologists call these Reactive Oxidative Species (ROS). Radicals will then go through radical reactions with any molecule in their way. So these reactions caused by ROS are incredibly detrimental because by stealing 1 electron from another molecule the ROS stops being an ROS, but the other molecule becomes one, so the reaction is maintained. All cells do have mechanisms to address this because cells do create radicals all time, but by dumping H2O2 on cells it overloads the system killing the organism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In water, oxygen is attached to two hydrogen atoms, like this: <strong>H--O--H</strong>. These hydrogen atoms are really just protons, and they don't care too much about the electrons that they share with oxygen (the dotted lines in the picture above). This is why it's easy for one to leave the electrons behind and go off and do its own thing (free hydrogen ions are what make things acidic). On the other hand, oxygen is an electron hog, i.e. it's highly electronegative. It's extremely difficult if not impossible to take electrons away from oxygen, like you can from hydrogen. (in chemistry, when we take electrons away from something it's called &quot;oxidation&quot; because it's what oxygen always does)</p>
<p>Hydrogen peroxide is a completely different molecule. Its structure is like this: <strong>H--O--O--H</strong>. That single bond between the two oxygens is not very strong. Each side of the molecule is pulling on that bond in the middle with equal strength. Because of the symmetry, when the bond breaks, you're left with two molecules that have a <em>single unpaired electron</em>, because the bond itself was originally two electrons. Electrons don't like to be unpaired, it's a quantum mechanics thing. When peroxide decomposes, each oxygen takes one of the electrons from the original bond.</p>
<p>The two molecules it breaks up into are called hydroxyl radicals, and they look like this: **H--O***. That asterisk represents the unpaired electron. Now that unpaired electron is a huge problem. In fact, free radicals are pretty much the most reactive compounds known. It especially likes to find double-bonds or aromatic rings to attach to (ELI15). And guess what has lots of those? Pretty much all the most important biological macromolecules, like DNA and proteins.</p>
<p>It's a really big problem when free-radicals can sneak past all your body's defenses and damage DNA. Fortunately, your body has lots of ways of absorbing free-radicals. This is why it's not a big deal to spill low concentration peroxide on your skin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difference is not gradual: changing one atom in a molecule changes everything about it.</p>
<p>Think of molecules like locks and keys, right? Some keys fit into some locks, and others don't. Some keys fit into many locks, some keys only fit in a few.</p>
<p>Just like any key, these keys have teeth that allow it to turn the locks when they're just right, or make the key absolutely useless. After all, you can't just put any key into any lock and expect it to work, right?</p>
<p>Now imagine we take a key called &quot;water&quot; that we know fits almost all of the locks the make up a human body: it hydrates practically every cubic inch of your body, but only because it perfectly fits in all those locks, right? Now take all of those &quot;water&quot; keys, and of each you file away one tooth. What do you think happens? They don't fit anymore! Your body isn't getting hydrated anymore!</p>
<p>A small, gradual change (filing down or adding to a key's tooth) can have <em>drastic</em>, fundamental consequences (no longer fitting a lock).</p>
<p>Adding or subtracting an element from a molecule changes he way it interacts with all other molecules.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

So caterpillars can totally live a long, full life of caterpillary wholesomeness, but they can’t have descendants until they transform into a butterfly or moth.  </p>
<p>Realistically speaking, in most species the vast majority of larvae get eaten by something bigger long before they reach adulthood, and those who make it are the rare exception.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an add on to the important points made in previous comments, a lot of it boils down to evolutionary pressures - sure, if conditions remain terrible for metamorphosis a caterpillar could stave off its transformation and never reach maturity before death. However, that individual would then never have the opportunity to reproduce and pass on their genes to a new generation. The caterpillars that quickly progress to metamorphosis and successfully reproduce are those that make up the new generation and majority of the population, and so shape the behaviors of future caterpillars. There is a pressure from natural selection for caterpillars to eat as much as they can and quickly get through metamorphosis before they are eaten as vulnerable larvae.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aerodynamic factors of vortices can be avoided by flying in proper formation (either with step up or step down, depending on the situation (step up being vertical separation from cockpit to cockpit)). Military aircraft (including helicopters) fly tight formation to decently sized aircraft (C-130s, KC-10s, etc) all the time during in flight refueling and that's generally not too problematic (as long as it isn't too turbulent).</p>
<p>Legally, it's because the FAA requires something like... I think at least <del>1</del> 3 miles laterally and 1000 feet in altitude (I should know this) between each aircraft on an instrument clearance (which pretty much all commercial flights have). Military aircraft can declare MARSA which is &quot;Military Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft.&quot; This relieves ATC of the 1 mile/1000 feet separation requirement and so the military pilots are now flying formation off the lead aircraft.</p>
<p>Edit: After some google-fu, it looks like lateral separation is 3 miles in a terminal environment and 5 miles en route, with (generally) 1000 feet of vertical separation. Source: FAA order 7110.65, 4-5-1 and 5-5-4.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Either 1000 feet vertical or 3 miles lateral separation (more if dealing with Heavy aircraft and aircraft on final approach if different weight classes). You can have less than this if flying under Visual Flight Rules (see and avoid).  Military aircraft flying in formation use a rule called MARSA - Military Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft - in which they fly under one flight plan as essentially one aircraft for purposes of ATC. Military planes doing exercises in restricted airspace are flying under VFR, and are responsible for their own separation.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ooh, fun question! I teach low-level programming and would love to tackle this!</p>
<p>Let me take it in reverse order:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is it possible to hand type a program using 1s and 0s? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, absolutely! However, we don't do this anymore. Back in the early days of computing, this is how all computers were programmed. There were a series of &quot;punch cards&quot; where you would punch out the 1's and leave the 0's (or vice-versa) on big grid patterns. This was the data for the computer. You then took all your physical punch cards and would load them into the computer. So you were physically loading the computer with your punched-out series of code</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And if I hand type all these digits into a storage and run it on a computer, would it open the file or start the game?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, absolutely! Each processor has its own language they understand. This language is called &quot;machine code&quot;. For instance, my phone's processor and my computer's processor have different architectures and therefore their own languages. These languages are series of 1,0's called &quot;Opcodes.&quot; For instance 011001 may represent the ADD operation. These days there are usually a small number of opcodes (&lt; 50) per chip. Since its cumbersume to hand code these opcodes, we use Mnemonics to remember them. For instance 011001 00001000 00011  could be a code for &quot;Add the value 8 to the value in memory location 7 and store it there.&quot; So instead we type &quot;ADD.W #8, &amp;7&quot; meaning the same thing. This is assembly programming. The assembly instructions directly translate to machine instructions.</p>
<p>Yes, people still write in assembly today. It can be used to hand optimize code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also to see the contrast, approximately how many digits are in a massive video game like gta V?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ahh, this is tricky now. You have the actual machine language programs. (Anything you write in any other programming language: C, python, basic --- will get turned into machine code that your computer can execute.) So the base program for something like GTA is probably not that large. A few MegaBytes (millions to tens-of-millions of bits). However, what takes up the majority of space on the game is all the supporting data: image files for the textures, music files, speech files, 3D models for different characters, etc. Each of things is just a series of binary data, but in a specific format. Each file has its own format.</p>
<p>Thank about writing a series of numbers down on a piece of paper, 10 digits. How do you know if what you're seeing is a phone number, date, time of day, or just some math homework? The first answer is: well, you can't really be sure. The second answer is if you are expecting a phone number, then you know how to interpret the digits and make sense of them. The same thing happens to a computer. In fact, you can &quot;play&quot; any file you want through your speakers. However, for 99% of all the files you try, it will just sound like static unless you attempt to play an actual audio WAV file. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>How many digits are representing a for example ms word file of 100 words and all default fonts and everything in the storage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, the answer for this depends on all the others: MS Word file is its own unique data format that has a database of things like --- the text you've typed in, its position in the file, the formatting for the paragraph, the fonts being used, the template style the page is based on, the margins, the page/printer settings, the author, the list of revisions, etc.</p>
<p>For just storing a string of text &quot;Hello&quot;, this could be encoded in ascii with 7-bits per character. Or it could use extended ascii with 8-bits per character. Or it could be encoded in Unicode with 16-bits per character.</p>
<p>The simplest way for a text file to be saved would be in 8-bit per character ascii. So Hello would take a minimum of 32-bits on disk and then your Operating System and file system would record where on the disk that set of data is stored, and then assign that location a name (the filename) along with some other data about the file (who can access it, the date it was created, the date it was last modified). How that is exactly connected to the file will depend on the system you are on.</p>
<p>Fun question!  If you are really interested in learning how computing works, I recommend looking into electrical engineering programs and computer architecture courses or (even better) and embedded systems course.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends.</p>
<p>The simplest way to represent text is with 8-bit ASCII, meaning each character is 8 bits - a bit being a zero or one. So then you have 100 words of 5 characters each, plus a space for each, and probably about eight line feed characters. Add a dozen punctuation characters or so, and you end up with roughly 620 characters, or 4960 0s or 1s. Call it 5000.</p>
<p>If you're using unicode or storing your text in another format (Word, PDF, etc.), then all bets are off. Likewise, compression can cut that number way down.</p>
<p>And in theory you could program directly with ones and zeros, but you would have to literally be a god to do so, since the stream would be meaningless for mere mortals.</p>
<p>Finally, a byte is eight bits, so take a game's install folder size in bytes and multiply by eight to get the number of bits. As an example, I installed a game that was about 1.3GB, or 11,170,000,000 bits!</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> I'd like to add a note about transistors here, since some folks seem to misunderstand them. A transistor is essentially an amplifier. Plug in 0V and you get 0V out. Feed in 0.2V and maybe you get 1.0V out (depending on the details of the circuit). They are <em>linear</em> devices over a certain range, and beyond that you don't get any further increase in output. In computing, you use a high enough voltage and an appropriately designed circuit that the output is maxxed out, in other words they are driven to saturation. This <em>effectively</em> means that they are either on or off, and can be treated as binary toggles.</p>
<p>However, please understand that transistors are not <em>inherently</em> binary, and that it actually takes some effort to make them behave as such.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: a MS word file with 100 words uses approximately 100,000 bits (binary digits, that is, 1's and 0's).</p>
<p>Here's the longer explanation:
First, we refer to those 1's and 0's not as digits, but as bits (binary digits).  </p>
<p>Second, a text file is technically different from a MS Word file.  A text file contains literally just that: text.  So for a true text file, the size is, as you deduced, the character count times the number of bits to represent a character (8 for ASCII text).  </p>
<p>A MS Word file, by contrast, is a binary file that contains all sorts of data besides the 100 words.  There is information on the styles, the layout, the words themselves, and then there's metadata like the author's information, when the file was edited, and if track changes is on, information about changes that have been made.  That info is actually what takes up (by far) the bulk of the spaces a MS Word file consumes.  A plain text file of 100 words would be about 6,400 bits; a MS Word file with the same words is about 100,000 bits (depending on the words, of course).</p>
<p>Your benchmark for comparison, GTA V, takes about 520 billion bits.</p>
<p>Hand type all those bits into storage?  Eh, it's a little fuzzy.  What you're talking about is somehow manually manipulating the registers in RAM.  And, sure, if you had a program that would let you do that (wouldn't be hard to write), then yeah, I guess so.  You could type in the 1's and 0's in to the program, the program would set the registers accordingly.  If it's a file you're inputting, then it's just about flushing the values of those registers to disk (aka, saving a file).  If it's a program you're inputting to run, then you've got to convince the OS to execute the code represented in those registers.  That's a bigger trick, particularly with modern operating systems that use signed executables for security.</p>
<p>Can you hand type a program in 1's and 0's?  Sure.  No one does that, obviously, though on vanishingly rare occasions a programmer will use a hex editor on code -- that's an editor that represents the bytes as 16 bit pairs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This actually seems to be more of a statistical question. Every ASCII character can be represented by 7 bits, but are often stored in 8/16/etc. bit data structures, and there are 128 different ASCII characters. But the clue here is obviously &quot;words&quot;. A word can be of different size, and obviously the sentence &quot;a a&quot; will have a smaller size than &quot;this word&quot;, but how is the distribution of 1's and 0's? </p>
<p>Some characters/letters are going to be used more than others. The letter 'e' is vastly more used than 'z', for example. And some ASCII characters used even less, especially in the context of words. A word is simply a sequence of characters, and in binary, they translate letter-for-letter, meaning that if </p>
<p>t = 01110100
h = 01101000
e = 01100101</p>
<p>then &quot;the&quot; = 01110100 01101000 01100101</p>
<p>Thus we see that a word and the binary length is proportional to number of letters in the word. </p>
<p>If W_l = length of word, then E[w_l] would be the expected length of a word in some document, and IIRC, that number is just over 5. So in a 100 word document, we'd have 5*100 characters, or 500 different characters. That's 4000 1's and 0's, if each character is represented by a 8-bit data structure. </p>
<p>Exactly how many 0's and 1's would depend on the word. Letter for letter, not in the context of words, the frequency is (most to least): EARIOTNSLCUDPMHGBFYWKVXZJQ</p>
<p>If you take the letters a - z, the 1 and 0 distribution is roughly 46% and 54%, uppercase letters simply shift the third bit from 1 to 0
whitespace has seven 0's, and one 1, so if there are 80 whitespace in a 100 word document, that would mean 560 0's and 80 1's. </p>
<p>SO, I would estimate, in a 100 word document / text file, with whitespace between words: </p>
<p>around 1800-2000 1's, 2500 - 2700 0's. If that's the question. You could easily make a program (in python, for example) which generates numerous 100 word text files from some NLP dataset, then run statistics / character frequency, and then convert to binary and count each 0 and 1. Do that N times, and calculate the statistics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thats a fun question. Each character is usually a byte, which is 8 bits (a bit is a 1 or 0).</p>
<p>For instance: <strong>01000001</strong> - is a capital 'A'</p>
<p>Taking the first 100 words in the english dictionary (I found the list online), <strong>A</strong> to <strong>Ableness</strong> here is how the sequence starts:</p>
<ul>
<li>01000001 - &quot;A&quot; <strong>uppercase</strong> <em>is signified by the first 3 bits (010)</em></li>
<li>00100000 - space character</li>
<li>01000001 - &quot;A&quot;</li>
<li>01000010 - &quot;B&quot;</li>
<li>00100000 - space character</li>
<li>01000001 - &quot;A&quot;</li>
<li>01100010 - &quot;b&quot; <strong>lowercase</strong> <em>is signified by the first 3 bits (011)</em></li>
<li>01100001 - &quot;a&quot;</li>
<li>01100011 - &quot;c&quot;</li>
<li>01101011 - &quot;k&quot;</li>
<li>01100101 - &quot;e&quot;</li>
<li>00100000 - space character.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the first 100 words in english there are <em>895 characters</em>, including spaces. So that would be </p>
<pre><code>895 * 8(bits) = 7160(bits)</code></pre>
<p>So there are about <strong>7000 or so</strong> ones or zeros in 100 words. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
