One of the characteristics of plasticizers is that they're volatile, meaning they naturally want to evaporate. The smell you get from a fresh can of tennis balls is the evaporated plasticizer that has built up in the canister.</p>
<p>Plasticizer evaporation is also the reason that extremely old tennis balls become brittle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The fact that your brain is able to simulate reality, and present it back to itself in a visual representation really calls into question about the nature of human consciousness, how we interpret reality, and how we exist within it. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sorry bub, no-one really knows the answer to this one. And it's even harder to explain in a simplified way.</p>
<p>If I had to give a response, based on current theories, I'd say that this phenomenon is performed by a part of the brain called the central executive. You can think of this sort of like a cross between an admin assistant and a 911-operator. It tends to do jobs that coordinate brain resources, but it also has roles in filtering/processing incoming information and ensuring the correct brain areas deal with the information/stimuli appropriately. If parts of this system are damaged or congenitally absent, then a person is not able to call up images or contort or change objects in their mind's eye. So this sorta provides evidence that generating these kinds of visual images is a process that involves multiple parts of the brain working as one - via the central executive.</p>
<p>One theory is that the admin assistant has a little sketchpad by their desk (in the literature it's literally named the visuo-spatial sketchpad), and based on (1) the information coming in via the senses, (2) your volition (your active desire to do something), and (3) your current emotions at the instant this is all happening, they sketch something down on the pad and that's the image you see in your mind's eye.</p>
<p>The important thing to note here is that the assistant doesn't know what the final image will look like - they're just sketching a hot-take of some object based on properties sent in via your senses, i.e. your eyes sending in an image that resembles something you've seen in the past, or your ears listening to something that sounded similar to something you've already heard. So let's say your friend asks you to imagine a television, your assistant isn't just going to sketch a Sony XBR 900F. You remember that a television could be a black rectangle, you remember that it could be perhaps thin, and you remember the context of a television (it's usually inside a house, there are usually pieces of furniture around, it might be on a stand, etc). Importantly, the form and the color of the object is assessed and sketched. Then, some physics is added and simulated. If it's light, then you might imagine yourself holding it. If you know it to be heavy, then it's likely situated a few arms lengths from you (and if you were to imagine yourself throwing a tennis ball at the TV, it wouldn't be knocked over). All of this is sketched roughly on the pad by the assistant (again, not knowing it's a TV because it doesn't interpret objects in that way).</p>
<p>Then your emotions add a dash of personality to it - perhaps you were feeling happy the last time you watched TV. So your assistant might add some imagery to it that aims to replicate those emotions (because you know there should be an image but you can't recall exactly what image was on the screen the last time you saw a TV).</p>
<p>And then with all those inputs combined, the sketch is completed and you see it! There's a bunch of stuff I left out, but this was getting long haha.</p>
<p>ETA: Here's something even crazier - none of this really makes sense without considering evolution. Within this framework, it's reasonable that being able to conjure mental images would be a selected trait from generation to generation. Even in the way I described above. For example, if our ancestors were out hunting and came upon a predator, it's reasonable that the faster we could interpret the pattern of signals we're seeing - say, a large black bear, then remember a previous danger, imagine that previous danger in the mind's eye (color and shape and physics), the better we'd be able to alter our behavior to avoid a bad encounter. And I'm not even getting into the process your brain can use to project/extrapolate your visual perception a few hundred milliseconds into the future to allow you to catch balls! Now THAT is some Matrix-level shit.</p>
<p>In reality, this specific bear might not even be the same species, or it might not even be a bear! But your brain has evolved to keep you alive and it heavily, HEAVILY uses pattern recognition to do that. So with all that in mind, it's better to prioritize the speed of image construction/imagination in the brain (by the sketchpad), rather than the accuracy of the image.</p>
<p>As they say, I'd rather be wrong and alive than correct and dead 😱.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This is called aphantasia, or lack of fantasy, I'm actually at a 0-1 out of 10 in my imagination while most of my friends are 8 or 9.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're all progressing steadily - no major failures have been reported yet, but this will take time. Best estimates are initial/topline data by year end, with a potential approval shortly after. Global roll out to public is unlikely till around June or so next year (due to a combination of manufacturing times, approvals etc.)The problem is that to prove a vaccine works is fundamentally different from a therapeutic. With a therapeutic, you can give the therapsutic/drug  to x people, placebo to x people, and in a relatively short time ( weeks to months) you can find out who's getting better, and prove efficacy.With vaccines, you need time most importantly. You can give the vaccine to x people, and placebo to x people - and then you need to wait certain time - long enough to compare infection rates between placebo and vaccine group. For e.g. there's 3 possible outcomes</p>
<ol>
<li>Infection rates are comparable between placebo and vaccine --&gt; vaccine isn't efficacious</li>
<li>Infection rates are significantly higher in placebo group than vaccine --&gt; great, vaccine works....</li>
<li>Infection rate is low in BOTH placebo and vaccine groups, and comparable -- This is the most irritating scenario. Because this could be due to 2 reasons - vaccine worked, but general infectivity dropped in both groups - due to social distancing, precautions, whatever. OR. vaccine didn't work, becasue the vaccine group was affected at teh same rate as the placebo group --- Meaning this is inconclusive. This is very common in vaccine studies and why a large number of vaccines fail in Phase 3.</li>
</ol>
<p>To reduce the likelihood of option 3, the approach is to test in large numbers of patients, over a significant amount of time ( 6 mo or so) , so that they can have data on the placebo side to compare. That's why this will take time.</p>
<p>Also the reason why anyone saying they'll have &quot;great results&quot; for a phase 3 trial that started in June/July by Oct/Nov is either unaware of the level of data needed, or is bowing to non-scientific pressure.</p>
<p>That said, you could have preliminary data (from a part of the tested population etc.) sooner than year end, but usually that's not enough to approve drugs unless in extreme circumstances. Additionally, a longer follow up is required for safety, which we may not have by then. So we could see promising candidates start to show up soon, but not ready for global prime time till mid next year</p>

<p>Edit: Fixed typo.</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the gold!!!!</p>
<p>Edit 3: Wow. Thanks for all the awards. Now I have to figure out what they actually do! I'm reading the replies and am trying to answer them as best as I can.</p>
<p>Edit 4: To clarify my timeline estimate further, I was referring to June as the expectation for the general public, i.e. all of us. The vaccines will most likely be rolled out in stages, with front line workers or high risk populations first.  Depending on if EUA is granted, we could see a conditional or emergency approval by early next year meaning those groups could get this by March or so. And then it'll be available to the rest by June.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 5:</strong> My best post ever, and the day I post AZ halts their trial - smh. This halt is not a failure. It's proof that the system is working as it was designed to, with the clinicians observing an AE they didn't expect, and so the trial is paused till they understand it better. </p>
<p><strong>Edit 6:</strong> The most frequent qn below is why not test the vaccine by infecting them with the virus. I've answered below, but briefly its ethics. Informed Consent is a key part of trials, and even more important in these cases to communicate the risks involved. We still don't know all the potential long term consequences, so how do you convince someone to risk their life by purposely giving them a potentially fatal virus? Offering money etc, would also be unethical. It's a complex topic - not unlikely but very complex.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, we don't exactly know. The general consensus is that it's caused by microscopic tears in the muscle fibers, but many exercise physiologists are skeptical and think there's more to it that we don't fully understand yet. What we do know is:</p>
<p>It's not a build-up of lactic acid in the muscles. Lactic acid gets buffered out and dealt with within 60 minutes of your workout. However, it's possible that the initial high concentration of lactic acid in the muscle during and immediately after exercise causes it. But when we wake up the next day and muscles are sore, they are not &quot;full of lactic acid.&quot;</p>
<p>DOMS (the official name) happens when someone does a new type of workout. Squatting heavy weights in the gym will produce DOMS like crazy, but you stop getting DOMS from squats if you keep lifting regularly. However, if you switch squatting rep schemes (going from 5x5 reps to 4x12 reps) DOMS may occur since it's &quot;new.&quot; A lot of people, especially gymbros, call this muscle confusion; and draw the conclusion that you need to switch up your workouts every few weeks or else your body gets used to one particular style and stops adapting. That's not entirely true. The severity of DOMS is not a good indicator on the effectiveness of the workout.  Just because you stopped feeling soreness after workouts, doesn't mean you're not improving.</p>
<p>It's possible to get DOMS the same day. Ultrarunners (crazy people who run 30-200 miles at a time) will talk about getting DOMS during a race, and having to suffer through it. I used to think they were mistaking it for another kind of soreness/fatigue, until it happened to me. It's real.</p>
<p>Sometimes, DOMS won't kick in for me until 48 hours later. I've tried to figure out why, but no luck. I've tried to supplement my workouts with extra stretching, extra walking/cool-down, extra hydration, excessive protein or carbs, creatine powders, ice baths, saunas, etc. to see if anything was a surefire way to prevent DOMS. I've tried to find a correlation between sprint intervals, high rep schemes, low rep schemes, explosive high-speed lifting, isometric holds, etc. and what causes the most DOMS and when it hits. I can't figure out any correlation or preventive measures, but I'm also not very good at record keeping and doing controlled studies on myself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A large percentage of your skin is made up of a protein called keratin.</p>
<p>Keratin forms long chains and if you were to look at your skin under a really powerful microscope what you would see is a bunch of keratin chains crisscrossing together like a chain link fence.  But just like a chain link fence, those crisscrossing chains leave large holes between themselves that water, or anything else, could go through.</p>
<p>To stop water from passing through those holes, keratin absorbs a small amount of fat from your skin's oil.  That fat sits in those gaps in the keratin chain link fence, preventing water from getting through.</p>
<p>Because keratin absorbs fat from your skin oil like that, anything that is able to dissolve into that fat is able to use it to leapfrog past the keratin in your skin and be absorbed into your body.  There aren't a huge amount of substances like that but that's why very oily substances, like poison oak/ivy, are able to get absorbed into  your skin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I ask because this place I used to go camping has a beautiful quarry with the cleanest freshest natural spring water you've ever seen.</p>
<p>The best hangover cure while out there, was to get in one of the shallow ends of the quarry and just hang out in the water. Find a nice spot to sit/float where you're submerged up to the chest and relax for a half hour or an hour. Bam. Hangover gone.</p>
<p>Maybe it was just relaxing, or the water cooled off the body and relieved symptoms that way. I always thought my body was absorbing the water. Apparently it doesn't do that. So it's still a mystery why this magic quarry cured even the worst of hang overs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the main jobs of your skin is to keep all your water inside instead of evaporating away, and things that are good at keeping water in are also good at keeping it out.  Skin oil is one of the major barriers to keeping water out, because water and oil repel each other.</p>
<p>The poisons that can get through the skin are usually oil-soluble and are the kind of threats our ancestors generally didn't run into often enough to need to evolve protections against.  Even if they had, the selection pressure for &quot;don't lose water&quot; is stronger than &quot;don't let oil through.&quot;</p>
<p>In contrast, animals that can absorb water through the skin usually live in environments where water is very readily available and water loss is rarely a concern.  Water-dwelling amphibian skins don't act as much of a barrier for chemicals, pretty much only acting a barrier against infectious agents and other large particles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>That’s a big part of it.  If you’re investigating a house fire and you can see that the end of the house where the garage is has been almost completely burned away but the bedroom end is intact, there’s a very good chance that the fire didn’t start in the bedroom.  So then you can start investigating what’s left of the garage for an ignition source.  </p>
<p>Same thing with brush fires.  If you’ve got a huge field that burned, absent any wind or changes in fuel density, the origin point will be near the middle of the burned area.  If there is wind, you can guess where the origin is based on wind speed and direction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They aren't always good at it.  We owned a rental property when I was a kid.  The fire marshal claimed it was opened paint cans that somehow started the fire.  It was latex paint.  No way for it to auto-ignite.  He insisted that was the cause.</p>
<p>We ended up doing the research ourselves for the insurance.  It was a defective hair curler that was related to a class action because a recall was never issued..  It had no temperature shutoff and would overheat hot enough to set wood on fire if you forgot to turn it off.  That's what started the fire.  The cans of paint were open because they burst from the heat.  The fire guy was a douche bag.</p>
<p>We found the source of ignition because the wood desk that the daughter used was complete ash with the fire spreading from there.  Then we figured out that was where she curled her hair.  No other possible ignition source.  Nothing else plugged in there.  She didn't smoke and didn't use candles.  We got the claim.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Smelling salts ampoules contain a small amount of ammonia. Ammonia triggers an inhalation reaction. Taking a deep breath brings more oxygen into the body.</p>
<p>As an aside, this also illustrates why ammonia spills (in large industrial quantities, not household quantities)  are so bad. The ammonia displaces the oxygen, but also triggers a reflexive reaction to inhale, so a victim breathes more of it in. Pretty much every safety team training plan includes having to watch a video where a highway patrol cop arrives on scene at a semi wreck where the container the semi was pulling was venting ammonia. The cop either wasn't trained for hazmat response or forgot his training and grabbed his first aid kit and ran in to try to help the driver. He succumbed to the ammonia gas in a few seconds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Smelling salts are basically a really strong smelling powder, which irritates your nose, making you take a big breath. They were used for rousing people who had &quot;fainted&quot; from a shock, a bad smell, or the sight of blood. They can occasionally make people focus on the smell or simply breathe more deeply, which can prevent a syncope. They don't do anything when someone is actually unconscious though, and they can cause irritation of the airway if used frequently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anecdote from my dad, who is a doctor:</p>
<p>My dad worked in the radiology department. Occasionally the contrast dye  (injected liquid that shows up on scans,) would cause someone to pass out. A new tech who has never encountered this would usually try to wake them up with smelling salts. The tech would sit the patient up while waving the salts under their nose. A more seasoned tech would then come in, drop the table to the flat position, lay the patient down, and throw the smelling salts in the trash.</p>
<p>The reason the patient passed out is because the contrast caused a drop in their blood pressure. Sitting the patient up is the exact opposite of what they need. They need blood in their brain, which can't happen with low BP and the brain higher than the heart.</p>
<p>So, smelling salts are not effective when the patient's brain is deprived of oxygen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>they're ammonia. inhalation causes minor irritation to the airways, triggering a reflex that counters certain kinds of fainting. </p>
<p>fainting is caused by vasodilation. basically, your blood vessels open up too much and instead of trying to push your blood through a straw, it's trying to power a fire hose. doesn't work too well.</p>
<p>the disruption to breathing caused by the ammonia causes reflexive vascular constriction. this can sometimes be enough for the body to pull itself together and maintain a proper blood pressure.</p>
<p>the reflex itself is quite powerful and can illicit <em>some</em> response in all but the worst circumstances. its ability to restore consciousness depends on the cause being vasodilation, and the body being able to maintain the elevated blood pressure after the salts hit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One example is to have most of the minorities living in poor neighborhoods with low property taxes and then fund education through property taxes. </p>
<p>Giving great mortgage terms to people in white neighborhoods so they can buy homes and start building wealth, and offering much worse loans to black neighborhoods so that they can't ever begin to own things and accrue wealth. It's called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining" target="_blank">Redlining</a>.</p>
<p>Another example is that black people tend to not be included in drug trials or medical research so they tend to have worse outcomes from the same healthcare system.</p>
<p>The legal repercussions of being caught with cocaine (a drug traditionally associated with white people) versus the much more strict and severe repercussions of being caught with crack (a drug traditionally associated with black people). Then the war on drugs leads to a LOT of black men in prison for very long sentences, and their children grow up in single parent homes, which when mixed with low income, poor education systems, and very little social/societal support, leads to increased rates of crime.</p>
<p>There are dozens of examples that add up to make it much harder to be a minority in America. It's not about having a guy yelling the N word at you in the gas station, it's about having a much harder time getting ahead, and a much easier time sliding down to failure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

</ul>
<p>And so, in the early 70's all the progress of the 1960s civil rights movement was brushed aside in favor of institutional racism against those elements they wished to silence and enslave.  Nothing has really changed at the federal level since, and the Klan, <del>outlawed</del> disgraced overtly, sent its members out to infiltrate and indoctrinate police forces nationwide.  Songs have been written about it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well Billy, I'm glad you asked.</p>
<p>So, when you learn about racism in school, you probably learned that some people are man and nasty to other people because of the color of their skin, or the shape of their eyes, or a bunch of other things. That is naughty, and you shouldn't do it.</p>
<p>Systemic Racism is when the rules in a society are set up in a way that is unfair to people who belong to a certain race. This can be intentional, or it can happen by accident.</p>
<p>For example, because of how badly treated African Americans were back in the past, a lot of black people today live in really really poor areas. This is because a lot of black people didn't have the opportunity to move out of poor, predominantly bad neighborhoods, so their kids live there today. Schools are funded by local taxes, so while white people in rich neighborhoods get to send their kids to well funded schools with a lot of teachers, tools, books and fancy classes, black kids from poor neighborhoods wind up in poorer schools with worse books, fewer teachers, and worse equipment. People aren't intentionally trying to give black people a worse education, but it happens because of the ways we fund schools.  </p>
