<p>It's called semantic satiation. I don't think we know the real answer, but there are some ideas. One is that repeatedly activating whatever neural patterns represent a word causes the brain to inhibit that pattern. This could happen to the sound itself (the recognition of the sound of the word) OR the actual meaning of the word in the brain. But yeah, I don't think we have conclusive answers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Sometimes focusing on one aspect of a word (like its sound or spelling) makes it hard to activate another aspect of a word (like its meaning or an object it represents), because they emphasize those different neural pathways- it's like trying to consciously pat your head and rub your belly at the same time, when you would normally do these things automatically and unconsciously.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Most planes require a runway to actually land on, so you can't really just land to pick up the survivors. For similar reasons, you won't be able to get the survivors off in a plane most of the time.</p>
<p>Depending on range, a Search and Rescue helicopter may come to pick them up, but if that's impractical, they will at least try to find a way to deliver food and water while arranging for a boat to come and do the actual pickup. This is what actually happened a couple weeks ago. <a href="https://time.com/5875356/deserted-island-sos/" target="_blank">https://time.com/5875356/deserted-island-sos/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The plane's only job is to call in the coordinates to the local authority, they can arrange the dispatch of a helicopter or fast boat that can deliver food/water to hold the survivors over for a few days until a rescue ship can arrive.</p>
<p>As for communication, a plane that circles a random island in an ocean is a pretty good sign they saw your signal regardless of if they can call you on the island to tell you so, there is a huge amount that can be communicated without actually talking.</p>
<p>Unless you somehow stranded yourself at Point Nemo, you're going to be within flight range of a helicopter that can drop off supplies within a day to hold you over for the 2-3 days until a ship can arrive to come pick you up.  If a plane has seen the signal then supplies will arrive within a day and rescue within just a few more, the problem is getting the plane to see your signal not what happens after they've seen it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a commercial pilot.</p>
<p>Firstly, as the Harrison Ford film Six Days and Seven Nights correctly intimated, if your trapped on a desert island and you see a commercial flight like an Airbus or Boeing, don't bother trying to signal it. You really would need to set off a nuke to have any chance of them seeing you, and even if those aircraft go particularly low for some reason, their cockpits are not massively conducive to looking at things on the ground at a 45 degree angle where they might be able to work out what they are seeing.</p>
<p>Your only chance would be with smaller commercial or private aircraft that fly lower. Beyond about 2000ft in height (Which is the measurement between you and the ground, altitude is the measurement between you and sea level which can be different) its kind of hard to work out what is going on down on the ground, so all that rubbish about making three fires in a triangle and so forth won't really work, (So if you ever see a survival instructor spouting that crap, correct him). If you want to be seen by an aircraft, go BIG. Biggest fire you can make, biggest sign you can make.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, any kind of symbol we recognise as a letter will draw our attention but the symbols V and X have a special status and indicate &quot;I need help&quot; and &quot;I need help and medical attention&quot; respectively. Waving your arms at us also works but a plane has to go really low to make that out generally so it's only useful once you have attracted our attention in another way. A red flare is the gold standard. We see red flares we pay attention.</p>
<p>One thing you have to be aware of is that context is important. Flying over an island and seeing these things will draw more investigation than say perhaps in a semi urban area, though red flares generally work wherever.</p>
<p>Once the pilot has seen you, they will (If safe to do so) make a low pass over you to observe and roll their wings left and right to signal we have seen you, generally known as giving you a wing wiggle. The pilot might repeat the pass if he/she thinks its prudent, safe and fuel permissive to do so.</p>
<p>Once the pilot has seen you and determined you require assistance, he/she will contact whatever ATC or radar control he is reporting to (A lot of private pilots and certain types of aircraft don't necessarily have to report to any in some areas of airspace). He/she may, given the situation and what he/she believes the situation to be, preface the call with the message &quot;PAN PAN PAN&quot; which indicates this is very urgent, and all other traffic on that frequency will minimise to allow him to report what he/she has seen. The pilot will provide the co-ordinates of where you were seen, the time that it was seen, what they believe the situation to be and will state clearly that search and rescue is required. The management of the rescue will then be relayed by that ATC or control station to the relevant authorities.</p>
<p>If fuel is permissive, the pilot might hang around for a few more passes, but will more likely just head on their way. Being in a plane, there isn't much more they can do for you.</p>
<p>A helicopter might be slightly different, but would for the most part follow the same process with the exception they may land. The would have to be in a fuel/weight/safety permissive situation and completely down to the discretion of the pilot, particularly if they have passengers they have to think about as they could in theory be putting themselves, their passengers or the aircraft at risk too.</p>

this is very interesting, as prokaryotes possess a defense mechanism similar to our adaptive immune response.
in short, after being infected, they cut the attackers' dna and store it in their own. These stored sequences are called spacers, and are found in a longer array of sequences called CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced palyndromic repeats). They are then used to quickly recognize and kill the same attacker during future attacks. This defense mechanism is currently being used to edit specific target genes of interest, and has the potential to cure tons of diseases caused by mutations (cancer, hiv, hepatitis, autoimmune etc). Probably one of the biggest scientific discoveries of modern times</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a recording, or in real life?</p>
<p>In a recording, this is caused by the spinning thing moving more than one half a &quot;step&quot; (if it's a wheel with 6 spokes, then more than 1/12th of a turn) every frame of the recording. When this happens, each frame puts the spoke closer to where the <em>next</em> spoke was in the previous frame, instead of itself. So if it's turning a little less than 1/6th of a turn each frame, then it'll look like it's moving backwards very slowly, as what looks to you like the spoke having moved backwards a little bit is actually the previous spoke having moved forwards almost a full step.</p>
<p>As the speed increases, it goes through a cycle: the movement speeds up, reverses direction, slows down, speeds up in the other direction, reverses direction, etc. forever if the frames are infinitely fast (they are really a perfect freeze frame). Real cameras aren't like that, so instead eventually everything blurs together into motion blur. How much the effect happens depends on camera settings, which usually also depend on lighting conditions. With some settings the effect does not happen at all (e.g. often in low light), while with other settings it is extremely crisp and clear (e.g. often when recording brightly lit scenes or outdoors in the sun).</p>
<p>With your own eyes this isn't really a thing the same way, but what <em>can</em> happen is that the object is moving so fast that you can't keep up with smoothly tracking your eyes on it. Then your eyes start &quot;jumping&quot; from spoke to spoke (the technical term for this is called saccades). You're basically blind when your eyes jump from one position to the next, so if you &quot;land&quot; on the next spoke, you can accidentally end up perceiving things to be going backwards, similar to the camera. But the rate at which your eyes move isn't constant, so this isn't as predictable as the camera situation.</p>
<p>Edit: Other than that, if all you're doing is staring at a moving object without moving your eyes, this effect does not occur, because your eyes do not have shutters. For the effect to happen, there needs to be something interrupting the light periodically, otherwise things just turn into motion blur once they get fast enough for you not to perceive the rotation. That something can be a flickering light: if you're watching a spinning object in artificial light, and it's the kind that flickers (as many cheap LEDs and fluorescents do), then that has exactly the same effect as watching through a camera, where every time the light flickers on your eyes get a snapshot of the scene, like a video frame.</p>
<p>For the camera issue, if you want to dig deeper (warning: ELI5 mode off), this is a really a form of (temporal) aliasing, and can be analyzed in terms of the frequency spectrum of the image in time. As the frequency of something exceeds one half of the sampling rate (frame rate), which is called the Nyquist frequency, the result no longer represents the original signal, but an aliased version that looks wrong. So if you have a 60FPS camera, that's a 30Hz Nyquist frequency. If you have 6 spokes, at 5 rotations per second, that's 30 spokes per second, and that's the fastest you can turn the wheel before it starts aliasing and &quot;spinning backwards&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, I know this one. Lets see if I can explain it.
Think of a paper flip book. You want to draw car accelerating. You draw first a car still, then the same car with the wheels a little turned, then a little more, etc... when you flip the book at max speed it looks like the car wheels are spinning, right? </p>
<p>Ok, now you notice the car wheels are not spinning fast enough so you start drawing the wheels each time further (more turned) than the previous image until they are so turned they look closer to their original position from the opposite side, so it begins to look like the wheels are going backwards instead of forward very very fast. </p>
<p>Then it goes even faster and it becomes a mess.</p>
<p>Does it makes sense?</p>
<p>Edit: this is a simplification, but it helps me understand it. </p>
<p>Edit 2: As some of you are commenting, I know that’s how a screen/projection works, not necessarily “real life”. <strong>Notice how my example, a flip book, is neither a screen or a projection</strong>, and yet we all know it works. Which makes me think there must be similarities in the way a screen shows animation and the way our brains read movement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Movement is just lots of still images played one after another, just like individual frames in a movie. Well, your brain and eyes basically work the same way.</p>
<p>Now, imagine the hands of a clock going around really fast. In the first frame the hand is at the 12. Then in the next frame at the 1. Then at the 2 etc. You see this as the hands spinning around clockwise really quickly.</p>
<p>Now double the speed, so it goes up by 2 each time. So it starts at 12, but in the next frame it is at 2, then the next at 4, then 6 etc. Now you see it going in the same direction but twice as fast.</p>
<p>If you keep increasing the speed, you can get it to the point where it is moving REALLY fast. Let's say it goes 11 spaces each frame. So it starts at 12, then it goes almost all the way around up to 11. Then the next it goes almost all the way around up to 10, then 9 etc. When you play these frames quickly, your brain will actually interpret this as going slowly backwards, rather than really quickly forwards. 12, 11, 10, 9, 8...</p>
<p>This is basically what happens when you watch a car wheel accelerate. It looks to get faster and faster until it starts to appear to go backwards.</p>
<p>You can also get a point where it goes around at exactly one revolution per frame and it will look like the wheel is just sitting perfectly still.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read somewhere that it's a primal response that hearkens back to our caveman days. If we heard the howling of wolves approaching, it triggered the fight or flight alarm and our hair stood on end. The idea is that some types of music can trigger that same response today.</p>
<p>I get chills all the time listening to music. My wife laughs because it doesn't happen to her at all.</p>
<p>For some reason music affects me more than the average person. Sometimes it makes me cry just listening to something beautiful. Not a sad song per se, but just music itself that's so beautiful that the tears well up in my eyes, I can't stop it. I feel ridiculous but they just stream down my cheeks, I can't seem to help it, it's just so beautiful it hurts. Fortunately that doesn't happen very often, and it's mostly when I'm alone, with headphones and no distractions.</p>
<p>But what does happen more often is that music makes my hair stand on end. I mean it <em>really</em> stands on end. It usually happens in response to a change in the music, like a chord change or progression, or the intensity or volume increasing, all of which would make total sense with the wolf howl theory.</p>
<p>I'll be driving along with my hand on the steering wheel, listening to music, and suddenly she'll notice that my arm hair is standing straight up. &quot;There you go again&quot; she says and laughs as she watches to see how long it takes until it comes back down. I'm glad she finds it amusing.</p>
<p>When it happens, it comes over me like a wave or a flush that accompanies the swell in the music. It starts from my torso and travels up my back with the hairs progressively rising, spreading out to my arms then up the back of my neck and then my face and beard. The strongest reaction is on my forearms, but if I feel even my cheek hairs get tingly then I know it's going to last longer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Frisson, also known as aesthetic chills or musical chills, is a psychophysiological response to rewarding auditory and/or visual stimuli that often induces a pleasurable or otherwise positively-valenced affective state and transient paresthesia, sometimes along with piloerection and mydriasis. The sensation commonly occurs as a mildly to moderately pleasurable emotional response to music with skin tingling; piloerection and pupil dilation do not necessarily occur in all cases. The psychological component and physiological components of the response are mediated by the reward system and sympathetic nervous system, respectively. The stimuli that produce this response are unique to each individual. Frisson is of short duration, lasting only a few seconds. Typical stimuli include loud passages of music and passages—such as appoggiaturas and sudden modulation—that violate some level of musical expectation.Wikipedia</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The chills you are talking about is most likely the little shiver you get when you do things like turn down a loud radio or move from hot air to cold or the other way around. This sensation is the body basically resetting its senses because there was a drastic shift in the surroundings that you literally went into momentary sensory overload. This can be evoked on occasion through music both because the song itself is being experienced through a sense as well as the body’s tendency to relate physical sensation to non physical occurrence and vice versa.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s always difficult to say what the purpose of such responses are at all, or why it occur. But for the Frisson, it most likely is the same response furry/hairy animals adapted and use to make themselves look bigger when encountering or expect to be met with a larger more power animal.
In that sense, this response is related to awe, as it is triggered when our brain perceives something greater than our current self. With this in mind and as a neuropsychological fundament, the Frisson seems to be triggered by art or profoundly great music; in which we perceive as great. </p>
<p>The frisson also seem to trigger more frequently or more easily in people who are good visualisers. As they can for instance imagine, or make up if you will, scenes of themselves performing the music. Thus encountering a version of themselves that is greater than their current self, and therefore trigger the frisson.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most answers here are at best partially correct. Here is the correct answer.</p>
<p>Venture capital invests in companies that are typically based on some innovation or novelty, that are young and have a strong future potential to earn 100x the money invested. The VC model is that 7/10 of these investments will fail completely, 2 will become zombies i.e. just about successful but never really breaking out and 1 will be so success it will pay for all the other failures as well as creating a big profit. Venture funding amounts start at seed stage with a few hundred thousand dollars and can go as high as 100 million. Venture capital is high risk and potentially high reward investing. As an analogy, VC investors build new houses with new designs in sometimes marginal areas that are currently undervalued.</p>
<p>Private equity investors are less risky. They are looking for mature businesses with steady cashflows that provide stable returns on their investment. They are also looking for ways to operationally restructure or financially engineer the investment to release more value. For example they may see ways to get hard cash from the business by selling off some areas or restructuring operations to reduce the amount of cash stuck inside the business in the working capital. They can literally deploy billions for the right invesrment, but often hold for relatively short periods, 2-4 years, while they improve the business and then sell it on. As an analogy, PE investors buy old houses in nice neighborhoods, fix them up and sell them on for profit.</p>
<p>Hedge funds invest in ways that try to ensure they make money no matter what happens, by investing in both positive and negative outcomes of the same investment. Hedging is the practise of investing in both positive and negative outcomes, typically using different means, for example by buying a stock and using derivatives like options or futures to offset any negative movements in the future. Hedge funds invest in highly liquid markets typically, so they can react quickly to changing circumstances, and are typically very private and highly sophisticated investors, using lots of technical ways to balance or even better exploit risks. Again they can command massive sums - tens if not hundreds of billions in some extreme cases, because a small edge multiplied by a lot of money equals a big profit. As an analogy, if a hedge fund bought a house, it would also buy some kind of insurance in case the value dropped below expectations. The expected growth would cover that extra cost, and the insurance would make sure they covered any potential drop in value.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Venture capital is a form of private equity. Hedge funds are a bit different. Ignore venture capital for a second and lets just focus on private equity. </p>
<p>Private Equity is an industry of companies that specializes in purchasing other companies <strong>temporarily</strong> (they would be holding companies if they bought companies permanently) and then selling them for a profit. The value add of PE is they use their experience and skills to improve the company they buy in some way. Poorly run business is never of shortage. The reality is more complex, but that is for an ELI6. </p>
<p>Venture Capital is a type of PE with a more specific focus. Traditional PE normally focuses on buying existing companies that are poorly run, or where they see an opportunity to run them better. Venture Capital on the other hand focuses more on ideas and companies in earlier stages of their life-cycle. Hence the name venture. It is still private equity because the company funded is still private and the funding company (the venture capital firm) is taking an equity stake...hence private equity. But in this case the company getting bought or funded is less sort of...proven. Doing venture capital is just a more specific focus of PE that has some unique characteristics. Time horizons for returns are typically longer for example. </p>
<p>The slightly more complex reality is PE is not just a dividing line between traditional and venture, its more like a spectrum with many companies specializing in the various areas of the spectrum. Some bigger PE firms specialize in more than one area. </p>
<p>Think of Hedge funds as higher risk mutual funds, trading on public securities markets. Though the appeal isn't necessarily to provide better returns than the market, but more like uncorrelated returns, but that is an ELI6.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Private Equity includes VCs but usually refers to a firm that buys and sells either up and coming semi-mature companies, or failing large companies. Their goal usually is to re-organize, re-strategize a company for a few years and flip it for a profit. Think of them as home renovators except for companies.</p>
<p>A hedge fund honestly can be anything. The main quality of a hedge fund is that it falls under certian SEC exemptions that allow it to invest in...well basically anything, at the cost that all it's investors must be 'accredited' which basically just means rich. This is to ensure if the hedge fund tanks (most of them do) the investors can afford the risks. If you're not essentially a millionare they legally cannot take you in. By anything i mean anything...equities, derivatives, futures, commodities, etc. It just depends on the fund&quot;s strategy. A hedge fund isnt nessecarily high risk, it just has more tools avalible than a long-only mutual fund.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Publicly traded companies trade thier stocks on a stock exchange. </p>
<p>Some companies are not (yet) publicly traded.  They can sell shares or give shares (equity) to private 8ndividuals. As private companies they have less reporting legal requirements and greater co trip if who buys thier stock than a public company</p>
<p>Private equity is buying equity/shares in those companies. It might be buying a controlling stake ( intended to take a companies board over )  or an investment in the hope of either good dividends or reselling shares at a profit later.</p>
<p>Venture capital is a type of PE where investors try to get in early on new ventures.  It's like a talent spotter seeing a artist or sportsperson in the early days and investing time or money in them.  9/10 of those investments may burn out/fail but occasionally somebody finds an apple or Amazon before they were famous.</p>
<p>Hedge funds I &quot;think&quot; are funds ( ie a place where people invest thier money  under the control of a fund manager )  the hedge manager tries to spread thier bets/investments to make a profit  in  variety of outcomes.  There are different financial tricks ( insurance ) that can make money for the fund even if something bad happens. So the manager hedges thier bets. They may not have the highest gains but equally they don't have bad losses. Hedge fund managers might buy public stock or I think bonds / gilts</p>
<p>In all cases it's just variations on different types of horse betting, but with companies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Most photos are taken extemporaneously by amateurs of non-models, and exactly one frame is taken. When you see a photograph which is taken of a model by a professional photographer, that photo is one of hundreds or thousands which has been selected because the pose best flatters the subject. Or, on the other hand, photographs of politicians are selected of those that are least flattering when they're run in news outlets ideologically opposed to the politician in question.</p>
<p>Here's a specific example. <a href="https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/24/931/524/694940094001_6089130430001_6089128945001-vs.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1" target="_blank">This</a> is a photo I grabbed off of Fox News of Nancy Pelosi. <a href="https://media.npr.org/assets/news/2010/09/21/pelosi-5d94489f1fb5d7d2077f4b562daafbc442f4f53d-s800-c85.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a> is the same person depicted by NPR.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Lots of bathroom mirrors have strong lights above or around the mirror, which lights up the face in a way that shows off all the good features. It shows your face the best it can look.</p>
<p>Now in the camera, normally people don’t know how to take a good picture of people. They take them in bad lighting, at bad angles, and with a bad focal length lens. This stuff is why portrait mode makes people look so good - they’ve digitally recreated a professional photography portrait set up. Some cameras even have a different physical lens for portraits.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of how a lens/distance from the camera changes appearance:

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I own many a snail- they move like this whenever they are attempting to conserve their mucus. </p>
<p>On a wet path, like a soaked piece of wood or moist soil, their slime trails will be continuous. On a surface like concrete, or even human skin, they will probably turn to their mucus-conserving mode of motion, arcing their bodies into an S shape. Both of these modes of moving involve the snail using waves of contractions of the muscles on the bottom of the foot; the conserving version involves lifting itself as well.</p>
<p>The consequences of failing to conserve mucus can be lethal for the snail; they can’t dry out before they can reach another source of moisture. Therefore, they’ll do this on dry, warm surfaces, especially if they’re in the sun.</p>
<p>Here’s a paper discussing their modes of locomotion and how it relates to the surface they’re on: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23493509/" target="_blank">link</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have a complete answer, but I just wanted to note that the mucus is used for stickiness more than slipperiness. A snail can move horizontally without mucus but it can't climb vertically without it. A snail moves by rapidly contracting the muscle on its underside in an undulating motion. I'm guessing this pattern is coming from where it makes the most contact with the ground on contractions and it does so in a regular pattern.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How does a one-legged animal walk on glue? Turns out that snail mucus has some super interesting properties. &quot;the mucus is a viscoelastic solid at small deformation and shows a sharp yield point; then, at greater strains, the mucus is a viscous liquid, although it will recover its solidity if allowed to heal for a certain period&quot;. So it is like glue and lubricant at the same time, depending on the pressure it's under from the snail's oscillating underside. Pretty cool. I read about this when I was a kid in the 80's, but here is link from 2014: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24631870/" target="_blank">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24631870/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Addictive drugs act on this pathway, even eating cheese acts on this pathway (freaking love cheese). When you first start to do something that you have a large interest in, that dopamine reward pathway is activated. As you do it more and more, and it becomes predictable and mundane, that reward pathway isn’t activated anymore.</p>
<p>Now when this happens with drugs (aka tolerance) you can just increase the dose, but if it’s something else, like a hobby for instance, you can’t increase the dose, and because this hobby no longer activates the reward pathway, you lose interest in it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Low altitude, very dry weather.</p>
<p>Air gets cooler at high altitudes and warmer at low altitudes, which is why you see mountains with snow capped peaks, and Death Valley is 282 feet below sea level (far enough that you could have a 20 story building in Death Valley, and it's peak would just be at Sea Level), so that helps it get extremely hot.</p>
<p>Additionally, death valley is in the middle of a desert, and there is almost no humidity. Water vapor in the air, tends to make things not as hot in terms of peak temperature, and not as cold in terms of low temperature. Dry desert air on the other hand can have wild temperature swings because the solar energy all goes into changing the temperature (sensible heat) rather than changing the levels of the water in the air (latent heat). There is over a 30 degree temperature swing in Death Valley from night to morning, in other hot, but humid, areas like New Orleans or Houston, that temperature swing is closer to 20 degrees. Bigger temperature swings help with reaching higher high temperatures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Places close to the equator usually have tropical climate. That means it's often cloud covered and there is frequent rain, which cools it down a little. The death valley is in a subtropical climate, that means there's still a lot of sunshine, but without the clouds and rain.</p>
<p>The reason that the death valley is particularly hot is the same reason that places high up in the mountains are usually cold: The heat from sunshine can easily go through the atmosphere, but the air acts like a blanket for heat coming from the ground back to space. Since death valley is below sea level, there's more air which can trap the heat inside.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
