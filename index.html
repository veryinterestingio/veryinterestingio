		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well their heart isn't beating for one thing. </p>
<p>In all seriousness, death by old age really isn't a thing. This is just a generic term assigned to older individuals that die of some condition (stroke, heart attack, etc) when the individual using the term doesn't know the actual cause of death, and suspects it was related to the patient's old age. You will (hopefully) never see a medical professional list the cause of death as old age. Are there any changes between alive and dead patients? Well this gets into the wonderful conversation of how we define death. Is a patient dead when their heart stops? Well they may have some brain function for a very short time after their heart stops. Some of their tissues can live for a surprisingly long time without the heart beating (brain death usually sets in before anything else). What about vegetative state patients? They have greatly reduced brain activity, but they aren't brain dead? However if we took them off life support their body would not support itself. The point I am trying to get at is that we don't really have a good way to define death, so it makes asking a question about what happens right after death kinda hard to answer. If you could be a little more specific about the cause of death, then you might be able to get a few more details. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I obsessed for a while on a similar thought. I was at my dad's bedside when he died. It was actually a process that took over half an hour after he stopped breathing until there was no electrical activity on his EKG.</p>
<p>I'm having trouble with the phrasing of this... but wonder about how long his brain is still 'him'. I know the electrical signals are gone, but the network of connections is still there, along with any chemical component.</p>
<p>So for SOME amount of time, even though he is dead, everything that made him him is still in there. His personality, his memory, all the skills he learned over 85 years. I wonder how long until all of that degrades and slips away</p>
<p>Are most of those pieces of him still there 15 minutes later? An hour? Two?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's little detail into what causes Rigor Mortis.  During normal muscle contraction the body uses ATP to bind myosin to actin. These two molecules form a dynamic chain in which the myosin heads will bind and release from the actin, pulling on the actin and shortening the sarcomere (the smallest unit of the muscle cell).  ATP is required to release the myosin heads from the actin molecules but not to bind to them.  When death occurs, the body is unable to produce the ATP needed to unbind the molecules and relax the muscle.  This leaves the muscle in a state of unresolved muscle contraction.  </p>

My guess is the original study that DID find a causal relationship is an example of publication bias, but it should also be pointed out that the strengths of the manipulations (i.e., how much fiction the participants read) may not have been sufficient to induce a change in empathy.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I understand the logic correctly the idea that reading fiction increases empathy posits the following</p>
<p>You read about other people in strange situations &gt; this helps extend your suspension of disbelief &gt; this expands your imagination &gt; this allows you to easier accept real world situations that are otherwise different than yours</p>
<p>I'm going to first levy some important questions before I dive into the scientific literature. </p>
<p>Firstly, does the genre of fiction matter? Would someone reading military fiction experience the same levels of empathy that someone who reads national geographic or women's fiction? </p>
<p>Secondly, reading ability correlates with wealth, life expectancy, education and a lot of other factors that can influence your ability to experience a broader world. If you showed a person various picture book would they experience a rise in empathy? </p>
<p>Thirdly, how do you empirically measure empathy? Unless you can peer into a persons mind you can't tell how they <em>actually</em> felt someone felt, but how they expected someone to feel. For instance, if they used the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2775495/" target="_blank">Toronto Empathy Questionnaire</a> they'd run into the problem of self-reporting. Testing empathy is <em>really</em> complicated and an inexact science. </p>
<p>Lastly, are these increases in empathy meaningful statistically, long lasting and are these increases in empathy limited to the subjects of the books (for instance if you read women's fiction will you be more empathetic exclusively toward women) or do they truly broaden a persons ability to empathize in general? </p>
<hr />
<p>I'm currently going off of Dr. Emanuele Castano's <a href="http://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Science-2013-Kidd-science.1239918.pdf" target="_blank">study report</a> which has been widely cited about this subject and has multiple studies with replicated results. </p>
<p>Genre is important: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our contention is that literary fiction, which we consider to be both
writerly and polyphonic, uniquely engages the psychological processes
needed to gain access to characters’ subjective experiences. Just as in
real life, the worlds of literary fiction are replete with complicated individuals
whose inner lives are rarely easily discerned but warrant exploration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They only measured short term benefits and self-reporting</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our findings demonstrate the short-term effects of reading literary
fiction. However, taken together, the relation between the Author
Recognition Test and ToM performance and the finding that it is specifically
literary fiction that facilitates ToM processes suggest that reading
literary fiction may lead to stable improvements in ToM. Since the Author
Recognition Test does not distinguish between exposure to literary
and popular fiction, additional research with refined methods is necessary
to test this important hypothesis</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They also did a replications of their work in their experiments to isolate further variables. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A fifth experiment (22) aimed to replicate experiment 4 and test for
the influences of subject variables (i.e., education, age, gender) and possible
confounds with a larger sample (N = 356). As in experiments 3 and
4, three works of literary fiction were taken from a collection of the 2012
PEN–O. Henry Prize winners (30) and three works of popular fiction
from an anthology (29).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You'd need an educated social psychologist and a statistician to break down exactly how the tests they used and their statistical conclusions support their thesis, but considering the replication and multiple testing methods I feel confident in the following conclusion...</p>
<p><strong>Empirical data supports that reading fiction does improve empathy, however it is limited to literary fiction and there is no data (that I have found) that can support statements of long term benefits.</strong> </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Look at the work of Lisa Zunshine and Theory of Mind.</p>
<p>It's been a while since I used it in research, but if I remember rightly, reading fiction activates mirroring in the neurons as we, the reader, develop a Theory of Mind for the imagined characters. This may not cause us to feel more sympathetic to a character, rather it hones our ability to create more accurate Theories of Mind as we the reader engages with literary devices (foreshadowing, priming, cues, etc.) to make sense of the story.  As a reader gets better at this sort of mini-game within stories, while some of the skills are transferable to real life, they will also enjoy reading more as they're able to gain more from it. </p>
<p>So in short, both.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is some research that suggests that reading literary fiction can increase empathy:</p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0055341" target="_blank">Matthijs Bal &amp; Veltkamp (2013)</a> collected, among other things, subjects empathy scores on the empathic concern subscale of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index questionnaire (i.e. assessing the extent to which statements such as &quot;I often have tender, concerned feelings for people less fortunate than me.&quot; apply to you) and then gave subjects texts to read before re-assessing their scores. The texts were either literary fiction or non-fiction (newspaper articles). They showed that a person's empathy score increases after reading literary fiction, but specifically if subjects reported being absorbed and emotionally transported into the story.</p>
<p>There was also the study by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1239918" target="_blank">Kidd &amp; Castano (2013)</a> who measured empathy more directly by asking subjects to identify emotions of facial expressions. Participants assigned to read literary fiction performed better than participants assigned to read something else. The authors interpreted the results as suggesting that fiction can promote a Theory of Mind, which is the skill of understanding others' mental states. </p>
<p>While these are some small short-term effects, there seems to be some evidence for a causal effect of reading fiction on empathy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not communist states, specifically, that often have demonstrations of military power.  Generally speaking, it's highly centralized states that have these shows of force so whether it's communist, fascist, monarchical, etc., it's likely that they have some type of military parade every so often for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>First, it's a morale boost.  Having a big demonstration gets the people all riled up, gets them feeling patriotic and nationalistic even if the living conditions are destitute.  Especially when you believe you're fighting &quot;the evil <em>insert whoever you think is evil here</em>&quot;, the military gets raised up to an exceptionally high role of honor and leadership in society. Think about the war-time propaganda even in the US during the world wars.  </p>
<p>Secondly, it's used as a show of force. Global politics can often seemingly devolve into a pissing match between two states and being better than the other guy is important for both your country and your geopolitical image.  The good old Teddy Roosevelt quote about carrying a big stick sometimes requires that everybody else knows you've got the big stick... So to speak.  The US and the USSR fought tooth and nail over every scientific and militaristic accomplisment in the 20th century and is a big reason why there's an American flag on the moon (all the sun bleaching probably turned it into a French flag now! :P).  </p>
<p>Finally, they become tradition.  Regardless of why you had the parade in the first place, they become an annual tradition to distract people from the real world for a little bit.  Patriotism and nationalism can be very important to different countries for different reasons but they can be a way to unite the people under a single cause and a single flag.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well for Estonia:<br />
Estonia’s Independence Day parade marked national independence that had been successfully defended militarily. The Estonian Army’s roots, however, were in the Imperial Russian Army. A total of nearly 100,000 Estonians had been mobilised into the Russian Army over the course of World War I. Estonian officers received their training at Russian military schools, mostly in abbreviated wartime courses.When military units consisting entirely of Estonians started being formed in the Russian Army in 1917, their formation took place according to Russian army regulations, and those same regulations continued to set the example for the formation of the Estonian Army over the course of Estonia’s War of Independence. Officer training at Estonia’s military school that was started up during the War of Independence was based on the corresponding Russian training manuals and this remained the case until 1927. By implication, it seems reasonable to assume that the way Estonian Army military parades were  organised had to also derive from experience in Russian Army parades at the military schools where Estonian officers received their training and in active service in the parades where their military units participated.  </p>
<p>Independence Day was first celebrated under wartime conditions on 24 February 1919. Parades were held in Tallinn, Tartu, Pärnu and Viljandi. Peace had been made in time for the second anniversary the following year, when parades were held in all centres with military garrisons. Everywhere else, local fire fighters and societies organised processions. The Kaitseliit began participating in military parades in 1925 while also organising its own parades in areas without a regular army garrison.<br />

<p>A catalyst is something that speeds up a chemical reaction, or enables a chemical reaction to occur at lower temperature than would otherwise be possible.</p>
<p>Since both metals form oxides naturally, and the oxygen can participate in chemical reactions, on a small (bacterial) scale there can be similar oxidation reactivity going on that just so happens to kill bacteria.  </p>
<p>In other metals, the oxygen atoms are more tightly bound to the metal atoms, so they are not as reactive.  </p>

Some copper atoms on the surface are not as held on as the rest, and as the bacteria crawls over it it can act like a bear trap and hurt a small chunk of the bacteria.

How does water get this clear without filtration and sterilization in the wild? Why doesn't algae and other life and biological residues fill it up and make it cloudy? In the case of the Maldives, aren't there plankton in the water? In the case of the stream in Sweden linked above, you can see dead grass in the water; if it flowed there across any sort of land and if the stream or pond has dead plant matter in it, why hasn't it carried suspended biological residues into the water?
(And lastly, is it possible to simulate those processes for man-made ponds?)</p></div></div>

Tropical ocean water is nutrient poor, and the Swedish mountains (the Scandes) are composed mostly of limestone. Lime is used to reduce acidity in fertilizer polluted lakes, so I'm assuming it causes the water to become nutrient poor somehow, although I don't know the exact process.</p>
<p>From an ecological point of view, algae might be suppressed by a herbivore under no predation pressure.</p>
<p>Oh and the picture is most probably real. Streams this clear are not at all rare in the Scandes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Temperate waters typically have lots of phytoplankton in it, whereas warmer coral seas are filtered by the coral, increasing the visibility such as seen in the Maldives photo. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Water near stream headlands has not picked up the nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and other nutrients. The ocean in the tropics is also very nutrient poor because the warm waters do not mix with the deeper more nutrient rich waters. The water simply cannot support the growth of much life. </p>
<p>You mention the grass, but if the source of the grass is close to where the picture was taken there is not time for the nutrients to become available this will be influenced by a lot of factors stream speed, temperature, or specific nutrient limitations. </p>
<p>Water in just about every habitat is filtered somehow. Rivers are filtered by wetlands and saltmarshes (which is why they are so important don't drain the actual swamp), in the tropics mangroves filter runoff from the land, and on small scales oysters, tunicates, clams, mussels, corals and sponges filter water removing organic material. </p>
<p>To replicate that in a pond generally requires mechanical filtration and chemicals.       </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see a lot of different answers with different aspects of this but none that really line up to the perspective that I read about when I studied historical fashion!</p>
<p>The suit became fashionable at the fall of the aristocracy and the rise of the bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>When people, men, started gaining power and influence because of their accomplishments, which is tied to the industrial revolution, and it was no longer something that was strictly inherited the philosophy and society changed and the view of the nobility was that they were lazy, gaudish, extravagant, decadent, wasteful and just terrible overall.</p>
<p>So the old power fashion with extravagant and overdone clothing became the symbol for something bad. Like this: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/raFyUij.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/raFyUij.jpg</a></p>
<p>Also, look at the legs, and heels on the shoes. Those kind of things became very feminine and the anti-thesis of men. Men where supposed to be rational and strict and those kind of expressions where for women who are more emotional etc. The view on sexuality also changed a lot at the same time, especially female sexuality. Sexuality was seen as something irrational and the purity of women and romance of love became more prevalent as well.</p>
<p>So the suit became the fashion for men with power. But how do you differentiate a bad suit from a good suit from a great suit? You really need to understand the details to actually tell the difference and that played into the idea of your own accomplishments etc. In many ways the fashion became so much more elitist. With the old fashion it was pretty much bigger was better, the one with the biggest and most extravagant clothing had the most power. Everyone could tell, from the poorest farmer to the king himself. But with the new fashion of the suit only the people in the know could tell. A poor farmer could impossibly tell the difference from what was considered a great suit from a simply good suit. So by simply knowing that it gave someone power.</p>
<p>My favorite example of this is the male fashion of watches that is still big today, unless you actually know you can't tell the difference from a superexpensive watch and a regular watch. Most of what makes the expensive watch so expensive is on the inside, it is the engineering and craftmanship that makes the watch special more than its gold and diamonds etc.</p>
<p>This also plays into the ideal of men as being rational and logical, there is a certain worth in craftmanship, jewelery is just pretty and doesn't have an inherent worth. Things that are just pretty are for women to appreciate, men appreciate things with absolute worth, or that is the idea anyway. </p>
<p>And you can see this ideal and philosophy in a lot of things, it plays into why men care so much about sports, because it is seen as having an absolute worth, it is something you can measure. So it is seen as more important than other things.</p>
<p>And of course, Europe where this all started have been the powercenter of the world and been seen as the ideal for most of the world in many ways so other cultures adopted this as they were dealing with Europe in different ways. Or you know, the whole imperialism as well where we pushed our ideals on other cultures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone is grouping up China and Japan into the same &quot;Eastern wears Western&quot; status, but the way western suits are worn in Japan and China are entirely different. In Japan it is a very formal symbol of being a Business person. But in China only businesses which are partly foreign owned and make most of their money dealing with foreign clients require this. Most regular business (at least in Beijing) dress smart casual to the office and the formal places would just require a dress shirt and dress pants. Actually it is a joke in China that if you wear a suit, people will think you are an apartment rental agent (real estate) because that is the only job that really requires all their workers to wear suits.
You will be surprised to know that Chinese people don't wear suits to formal occasions - if you go watch an opera or to an orchestra performance or go to a nice club you will rarely see any guy in a western suit. Most regular middle class Chinese men don't have a formal suit in their closet.</p>
<p>Edit: Also why is no one talking about Thailand. They have their own business suit that is pretty common.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The findings in the study linked show that the particular kind of fatty chains stored in big booties are particularly nourishing to neonatal brains, and that woman with an ideal WHR (waist-hip ratio; basically that hourglass figure that women strive to have) has more neuro-developmental resources to offer her infant. </p>
<p>Breasts do grow in size somewhat during pregnancy because the milk ducts are filling with colostrum, the &quot;first milk&quot; that women produce. It's incredibly calorie, fat, and nutrient dense, and a middling yellow in colour, as opposed to the more traditional whitish milk needed by more mature infants (past the first week or so). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From my understanding, breast size is more to do with displaying age than anything else. <a href="http://content.iospress.com/articles/technology-and-health-care/thc00471" target="_blank">Larger breasts are more easily identified as &quot;old&quot;</a> than smaller ones. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0162309595000023" target="_blank">This helps men identify fertile females</a>, hence the mild preference for larger breasts.</p>
<p>The breast size has little to do with milk production or even energy reserves, but was sexually selected for as a measure of youth and fecundity. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As many people have already pointed out, breast size does not correlate to milk production.  A woman's breasts (non-pregnant, non-nursing) are basically entirely fat tissue.  The actual glandular tissue doesn't start to hypertrophy until prolactin levels rise during pregnancy.  That is why they grow, but the size prior to prolactin has nothing to do with milk production.  Interestingly, humans are some of the only mammals that develop and maintain breast tissue in the absence of lactation. Breasts form initially in response to the elevating estrogen levels of puberty and are considered a secondary sex characteristic. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Research has shown that the endobacteria of humans varies a little by geography but more so by diet. As in, we contain the microbes we feed best. Some gut flora can get pretty messed up in individuals such as those contracting &quot;C. Dif&quot; (Clostridium difficilis) and in those cases sometimes a fecal transplant is prescribed!

<p>After a penicillin cure you should also reintroduce your flora, for instance by adding probiotics to your diet or eating local whole foods.</p>
<p>Some food allergies can be overcome by not eating those foods for 3 to 5 months and then slowly reintroducing them again with baby steps. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I'm not really talking about removing genetic disease, but parents picking and choosing desirable traits for their children: making them stronger, better looking, smarter etc. Do you think it could potentially create an even greater disparity between the rich and poor? Richer parents being able to afford to give their children far better traits than the poor for example. Or is this unlikely? </p>
