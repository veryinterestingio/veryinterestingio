		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned in other comments, red blood cells, platelets and plasma (99.999% of blood transfusions) do not contain DNA. Any DNA from the donor would be within leukocytes (white blood cells - mostly neutrophils and lymphocytes) which are present in small numbers in these products. Granulocyte transfusions are used in exceptionally rare circumstances and are probably not worth discussing the implications.</p>
<p>Where I practice (Australia), red cell transfusions are univerally leukodepleted (using a fine filter during processing) so that the end product transfused contains minimal leukocytes. In the US I think it varies from state to state, and even between different blood services. Red cell transfusions which aren't leukodepleted can use a bedside filter, but these have been shown to be inferior in preventing various transfusion reactions/complications.</p>
<p>Transfused leukocytes are recognised as foreign by the recepient's immune system and promptly removed, including their DNA contents.  Not so much mixing or switching, as just getting eaten up and going away. After a single blood transfusion, a DNA test on a recepient would contain very (very) little donor DNA present, and this would be readily distinguished from recipient DNA on a quantity basis (if detectable at all). Generally, we do rely on genetic testing of blood samples for various things (like genetically testing your blood phenotype, for example), even when someone is heavily transfused, as the amount of donor DNA still floating around is essentially negligible unless you are looking for it really hard.</p>
<p>There is a thankfully very very rare situation called &quot;transfusion-associated graft versus host disease&quot;, where lymphocytes in the donor red cell unit can escape detection by the recipient's immune system and engraft in the recipient. This foreign immune population can grow and eventually attack the recipent's body - graft versus host disease (GVHD). Unlike GVHD associated with bone marrow transplantation, this TA-GVHD responds very poorly to immunosuppressive medical therapies, and is almost universally fatal. This is why, further to leukodepletion, we irradiate blood products which are going to be given to immunocompromised recipients, or when blood is donated from a close relative (as the lymphocytes can be similar enough to escape the recipient's immune system, but different enough to then attack the recipient). Irradiation further reduces the number and lifespan on any remaining lymphocytes in the product. I bring TA-GVHD up as it is the opposite of what usually happens to donor lymphocytes and circulating DNA.</p>
<p>Most studies on the survival kinetics of donor leukocytes and detectable DNA in recipients were done before the widespread use of leukodepletion, but they still get at your question if you are interested. For example:<a href="https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/85/5/1207/118119/Transient-increase-in-circulating-donor-leukocytes" target="_blank"><a href="https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/85/5/1207/118119/Transient-increase-in-circulating-donor-leukocytes" target="_blank">https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/85/5/1207/118119/Transient-increase-in-circulating-donor-leukocytes</a></a><a href="https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1537-2995.1997.37111298088037.x" target="_blank"><a href="https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1537-2995.1997.37111298088037.x" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1537-2995.1997.37111298088037.x</a></a></p>
<p>The plain old <strong>blood group</strong> of the patient follows much more of what you are describing in terms of mixing. Blood grouping is done by looking at sugars and proteins on the outside of red cells to determine A, B, AB and Rh(D)+/- etc, not on DNA (speaking using traditional methods). If you have received a transfusion and someone examines your blood group, you can detect those donated red cells as a &quot;mixed field&quot; or dual population-reaction if they are a different group to your own (if you are A+ and received group O- blood, for example), as the red cells are still around and circulating happily - probably for 6-12 weeks (as opposed to DNA in leukocytes which get eaten up quickly).</p>

<p>Edit: As there have been a few follow up questions and I could have been clearer:When I say that red cells, platelets and plasma do not (effectively) contain DNA, I am referring to actual red <em>cells</em>, actual <em>platelets</em> and the plasma in your blood. When I say there is a tiny bit of DNA in transfused products, I am referring to processed packed red cell units, processed platelet units and processed plasma products. The little DNA that is in these products is (mostly) from the residual small numbers of leukocytes in those products which remain after processing.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when we take a blood for a DNA test, we generally do this from a whole blood sample (usually anticoagulated in EDTA, if you are interested). Essentially the DNA is extracted and amplified from leukocytes (mostly lymphocytes) within this sample to do the testing. Blood tests are a great way for doing DNA tests, and there is a big difference in the way a sample is processed to amplify someone's DNA for testing, versus the processing of blood donations specifically to reduce leukocyte (and therefore DNA) content.</p>
<p>Also, thank you for the words and reddit-gifts, kind science-loving strangers.</p>
<p><strong>Double edit</strong> - lots of questions about bone marrow transplants and the implications here. There are some great replies below, and here are some more thoughts: </p>
<p>Distinction needs to be made between the transplant itself, and the following immunosuppression.</p>
<p>A bone marrow transplant is otherwise known as a &quot;haematopoietic stem cell transplant&quot; HSCT. There are two types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Autologous HSCT, where someone's own stem cells are given back to them after high dose chemotherapy to rescue their bone marrow, and</li>
<li>Allogeneic HSCT, where someone else's stem cells are given to you following 'conditioning', where your bone marrow (and &quot;immune system&quot;) is esssentially wiped out and replaced with the donor's.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we are talking about someone else's DNA, allogeneic HSCT is the one we are talking about here.</p>
<p>Conditioning therapy is generally very intense, and may sometimes combine high dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy. It achieves multiple goals, but mostly:</p>
<ol>
<li>Killing off any residual cancer (e.g. acute myeloid leukaemia) that might be left (the reason you are getting the transplant in the first place)</li>
<li>Wiping out your immune system so that it will allow the incoming stem cells to come and grow in your bone marrow and replace your blood cells</li>
</ol>
<p>After the conditioning you receive an infusion of donor stem cells, when then slowly engraft over the following weeks, turning into white cells, red cells and platelets (usually appearing in that order). In the mean time you have essentially zero white cells, and you are supported with red cell and platelet transfusions as needed.</p>
<p>Once your blood counts come back, those blood cells are now not your own, but have the DNA and outer appearance of the donor's immune system and red cells.</p>
<p>(And yes, we frequently transplant people with mismatched ABO systems, such that you can be A- before your transplant, and end up with O+ afterwards (for example). There are no limits on this mismatch, but each situation has different considerations for transfusing products, at different stages of the transplant (before, during, after engraftment). )</p>
<p>The method your immune system uses to differentiate self from non-self is (mostly) the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) system. Your HLA expression is essentially unique to you (with some heritability patterns), and HLAs are expressed on pretty much all cells (including your immune cells - lymphocytes). Going into the testing for HLA compatibility between donors and recipents is probably a bit too complicated for this post, but suffice to say there are different variation in surface glycoproteins (like ABO, but x1000 in complexity) which your immune system uses for identifying self and non-self, and you can make antibodies and also have direct cellular toxicity against HLA that you see as foreign.</p>
<p>Once you have your brand new blood system from your donor in your bone marrow and swimming around your body, those lymphocytes will likely start to see <em>you</em> as foreign, and start to attack your organs. This is graft versus host disease, and <em>this</em> is the reason immunosuppression is given after allogeneic HSCT - to suppress your <em>new donor immune system from attacking you</em> (too much).</p>
<p>So if you take a blood test for DNA measurement in an allogeneic HSCT recipient, this will show the donor's DNA, not yours. In fact, we do studies (called <em>chimerism studies</em>) which measure this - how much circulating cellular DNA belongs to your donor, and how much is yours? If things are going well with a transplant, it should all be your donors. If your leukaemia is relapsing or the graft is failing, we will start to see your own bone marrow or leukaemia cellular DNA start to come back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned before the RBCs in a blood transfusion have no DNA. Any blood cells that happened to get transfused with DNA will have a temporary life span (such as white blood cells)</p>
<p>The more interesting case is when some people get bone marrow transplants, because now the region of their body producing the RBCs is of a different DNA. This is why bone marrow transplants can be curative of blood disorders - the composition of their blood is now fundamentally different (and presumably normal). There’s actually rare cases where people get bone marrow transplants and their body fights off a disease or cancer it has because the bone marrow they received produced a white blood cell capable of fighting what they had when their original white blood cells couldn’t.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There is a rare condition known as transfusion-associated microchimerism, where the donor leucocytes persist in the recipient's circulation as a stable population.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Japan, all transfused blood has to be irradiated in order to inactivate or kill the white blood cells.  The reason behind this is because live donor white blood cells can attack the recipient's blood cells and bone marrow and eventually kill the recipient.</p>
<p>Usually this isn't an issue as the recipient usually has WAY more white blood cells to kill these donated white blood cells (WBCs).  However, in japan, the DNA of these white blood cells can be so similar that the donor cells can 'hide' and not be detected by the host immune system.  However, the host DNA is still recognized as different by the donated WBCs and these white blood cells just slink around slowly destroying the bone marrow of the host.  :(  This is almost universally fatal although some stats say 80-90%.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is the paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If one wants to summarize our knowledge of physics in the briefest possible terms, there are three really fundamental observations: (i) Spacetime is a <strong>pseudo-Riemannian manifold</strong> <em>M</em>, endowed with a <strong>metric tensor</strong> and governed by geometrical laws. (ii) Over <em>M</em> is a <strong>vector bundle</strong> <em>X</em> with a <strong>non-abelian gauge group</strong> <em>G</em>. (iii) <strong>Fermions</strong> are sections of <strong>(Ŝ +⊗VR)⊕(Ŝ ⊗VR¯)(Ŝ+⊗VR)⊕(Ŝ⊗VR¯)</strong>. <strong><em>R</em></strong> and <strong>*R***</strong>¯<strong> are not </strong>isomorphic<strong>; their failure to be </strong>isomorphic<strong> explains why the light fermions are light and presumably has its origins in representation difference Δ in some underlying theory. All of this must be supplemented with the understanding that the geometrical laws obeyed by the </strong>metric tensor<strong>, the </strong>gauge fields<strong>, and the </strong>fermions** are to be interpreted in quantum mechanical terms.  </p>
<p>Edward Witten, &quot;Physics and Geometry&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Eric Weinstein (who I know is a controversial figure, but let's leave that aside for now), this is the most beautiful and important paragraph written in the English language. You can watch him talk about it <a href="https://youtu.be/vdW9XDBuxjU?t=3079" target="_blank">here</a> or take a deep dive into his <a href="https://theportal.wiki/wiki/Graph,_Wall,_Tome" target="_blank">Wiki</a>.</p>
<p>Could someone (1) literally translate the paragraph so a layman can grasp the gist of it, switching the specific jargon <strong>in bold</strong> with simplified plain English translations? Just assume I have no formal education in math or physics, so feel free to edit the flow of the paragraph for clarity's sake. For example, something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If one wants to summarize our knowledge of physics in the briefest possible terms, there are three really fundamental observations: (i) Spacetime is a <del>pseudo-Riemannian manifold</del> <strong><em>flexible</em></strong> <strong><em>3-dimension space</em></strong> <em>M</em>, endowed with a <del>metric tensor</del> <strong>composite list of contingent quantities</strong> and governed by geometrical laws... etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And (2) briefly explain the importance of this paragraph in the big picture of physics?</p></div></div>

<p>Well, this paragraph is saying that that's basically how it is. All of the fundamental forces of nature can be explained by geometry. The map is at least four dimensional, and Pythagoras's theorem doesn't apply the way you think it does, and the algebra is horrendously complicated, but it's all geometry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1) Space is flexible with time, in a specific squishy way.  Call it &quot;M&quot; because we'll refer to it later. The squishiness of space and time follows a specific set of rules for 3D manipuation, called a &quot;pseudo-Riemannian manifold&quot;.  The way it squishes is called a tensor, and it follows geometrical laws.  There are a bunch of formulas involved in that manipulation, but it means you can convert between time and space, that stuff in space affects time, and stuff in time affects space.</p>
<p>2) There are a bunch of values well call &quot;X&quot; that can modify space and time. They represent forces and fields. They follow special ordering rules, and form a gauge group. You can use these values X to modify the squishy thing in the first point. These things represent energy and motion. They have specific ordering requirements, and they cannot be easily reversed.  As an ELI5 of that if you have 3 and you subtract 3 you don't always get 0; if you want to get zero again you have to do extra steps.  These explain the relationship of how you can squish space and time around to change their shapes.</p>
<p>3) Subatomic particles that make up matter, called fermions, that all meet a general pattern. This things make up mass. The pattern formula has multiple solutions, and includes both a positive side and negative side. Even though it has two sides, they're not opposites from each other like you would have +3 and -3 that are equal and map to each other, the two opposite sides are not isomorphic.  These things still have some big questions to be answered, but they explain how you can manipulate matter and space.  (There is another set, called bozons, that have a similar relationship with energy).</p>
<p>So an ELI5 rewrite:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can see three fundamental things about the universe:  (1) Space and time are squishy according to a set of rules.  We have math that predicts it.  (2)  Squishing space and time depends on ordering and a second set of rules, and any squishes generally cannot be easily undone. We have math for predicting this, too. (3) Subatomic particles another set of rules that build all matter, but we only have most of the math to model it, not quite all of it for a complete model.</p>
<p>Putting those three topics together gives all our current rules for space, time, energy, motion, and mass, and conversions between them. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using those general words describes the relationship of all the various conversions and systems we know in physics. The next picture in the video shows a clip of a wall that depicts a bunch of the relationships.  Some are well known, like how E=mc^2 is the relationship between energy and matter and explains things like why converting matter into energy in an atomic bomb creates huge amounts of energy.  Others explain relationships with space and distance, and relationships with time.  They all inter-relate, something that relates with space and distance and time also must relate with motion  and force.</p>
<p>I don't think it's particularly beautiful, but I can see why he likes it as a short summary of our current physics models.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>PhD student in theoretical physics here. This paragraph describes what the whole universe really is and what everything in the universe is fundamentally made of. It touches on a lot of very advanced ideas in mathematics, but I'll do my best to unpack it. Warning: It'll be long.</p>
<p><strong>(i)</strong> Age-old question: What does the whole universe look like if you stand &quot;outside&quot; of it? Is it like a flat plane that extends in all directions forever? Is it like a ball, where if you walk in one direction for a while, you'll return to your original position? Or is it like a large twisted pretzel with holes? In mathematics, we call these different shapes, flat or curved, <strong>manifolds</strong>.</p>
<p>To describe a &quot;pretzel&quot; or a &quot;flat plane&quot;, we need to say where the shape is &quot;rounded&quot; or &quot;curved&quot;, like a blind man touching an elephant, telling his friend where the round belly is and where the trunk is sticking out. We call this description a <strong>metric tensor</strong> on the manifold.</p>
<p>What this point tells us is that our universe has all sorts of bumps and troughs here and there, and everything in the universe—the Sun, the Moon, galaxies—move around according to where the bumps and troughs are, like a small ant on a pretzel trying to walk in a &quot;straight line&quot; but inadvertently walking in circles. In other words, the Earth goes in circles around the Sun (and stars around galaxies) because it follows <strong>geometrical laws</strong> of &quot;how to walk on an irregular bumpy manifold&quot;.</p>
<p>It turns out that clocks run at different speeds depending on where they're placed in the universe, whether it's at the bottom of a trough or on flat ground. Physicists figured out that that's because space isn't the only thing getting curved and twisted in our universe; time is too. Normal run-of-the-mill manifolds don't do the job anymore. This is when <strong>pseudo-Riemannian manifolds</strong> come in to describe our universe, where both time and space are twisted with each other, into curved <strong>spacetime</strong>. Don't even try to imagine what that looks like; we can't either. All this is described in more detail in this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_general_relativity" target="_blank">Introduction to General Relativity</a>.</p>
<p><strong>(ii)</strong> Another age-old question: Magnets, how do they work? Also, what makes rocks stick together and not fall apart? Physicists have figured out that these forces are due to these things called <strong>fields</strong>, which are invisible but permeate everywhere in the entire universe. Take the electromagnetic field as an example. It is everywhere. Closer to a magnet, where the field is stronger, a second magnet gets attracted to the first one very quickly; farther from the magnet, where the field is weaker, the second magnet barely moves at all.</p>
<p>Remember from (i) that our universe is a curved shape called a manifold? Well, the electromagnetic field (and other fields for other forces) is everywhere on this manifold. In mathematics, we call that a <strong>fibre bundle over the manifold</strong>. (Pardon the strange name. If you try to imagine little hairs on a pretzel indicating how strong the field is at each point on the pretzel, it ends up looking like a bundle of fibres.)</p>
<p>Now we need to know how the electromagnetic field makes the magnet move around, how it makes your microwave cook your food, and how light comes out of a lightning. All of this is described by a very special kind of theory called <strong>gauge theory</strong>. What you need to know is that every gauge theory comes with a mathematical structure called a <strong>group</strong>. The simpler the group, the simpler the the interaction between the corresponding force and matter is, and vice versa. The simplest group is an <strong>Abelian group</strong>, which is what describes the electromagnetic field.</p>
<p>The electromagnetic field also keeps rocks together and strong. But if you chop a rock into little pieces, you get to the atom, made of neutrons, protons, and electrons. Neutrons and protons are in turn made of even smaller particles called quarks. What keeps the quarks together in a neutron or a proton is the strong nuclear force, caused by the <strong>gluon field</strong>. Neutrons and protons can also turn into each other, emitting radiation that makes some cancer treatments possible. This is due to the weak nuclear force, caused by the <strong>W and Z boson fields</strong>.</p>
<p>These fields are also described by gauge theories, so they're called <strong>gauge fields</strong>, but their interaction with matter is so complicated that their corresponding groups are <strong>non-Abelian groups</strong>, which is as complicated as you can get when it comes to groups.</p>
<p><strong>(iii)</strong> One final age-old question: What's stuff made of? What's the smallest bit of matter? As I said before, chopping things down to the smallest pieces gives you electrons and quarks. These particles (and a few others) all belong to a class of particles called <strong>fermions</strong>. The special thing about fermions is that every fermion has a left-handed and a right-handed version, just like gloves—they look alike, but are mirror reflections of each other.</p>
<p>The gluon field doesn't care whether the fermion is left or right-handed. It doesn't discriminate. (Be like gluon.) You might think the electromagnetic field and the W and Z boson fields are good guys too, but no, they like to interact more with the left-handed fermions than the right-handed ones. This is what the formula means.</p>
<p>The correct formula is (Ŝ+⊗VR)⊕(Ŝ−⊗VR̃). (Unfortunately, Reddit doesn't support subscripts.) It basically says the left-handed fermion Ŝ+ interacts with all the gauge fields in this way (VR), while the right-handed fermion Ŝ− interacts with the gauge fields in a different way (VR̃). It is important that VR and VR̃ are <strong>not isomorphic</strong>, which is just a snobby way of saying &quot;they're different&quot;.</p>
<p>We know that the electron, along with another fermion called the neutrino, is lighter than the quarks. We don't yet know why that is the case, but every new idea physicists have come up with over the years involves the difference between the way gauge fields interact with left-handed and right-handed fermions (<strong>representation difference</strong>). If one of those ideas turns out to be correct, then it is the <strong>underlying theory</strong> that we all dream about.</p>
<p>Finally, if all of the above is not complicated enough, God plays a joke on us by making everything <strong>quantum mechanical</strong>. In short, this means that the same particle can be in several different places at the same time, and particles are randomly popping in and out of existence everywhere, all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Personal thoughts:</strong> The paragraph is certainly very concise, mostly because it takes entire textbooks to truly describe the mathematical terms in each of the three bullet points. It is also very beautiful, because it tells you in precise mathematical terms what you'd need if your job were to create another universe. However, it's like describing an elaborate wedding cake by listing all its ingredients.</p>
<p>&quot;The most beautiful paragraph in physics&quot; is a bit of a stretch. Sure, it encapsulates what our universe is, deep down. But it doesn't capture any of the emergent phenomena—how these particles come together into complex atoms and molecules, how atoms form beautiful crystals and rocks, how rocks form planets, how stars and dust form galaxies, how too much stuff makes a black hole... Physics is a vast subject with countless interesting questions to study, and &quot;what is the fundamental structure of the universe&quot; is just one of them.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Our universe has curved spacetime in which matter, made of very small particles called fermions, interacts through forces controlled by gauge fields. The interaction is different for left-handed and right-handed fermions. The paragraph is beautiful because it tells us what blueprint God had in mind when creating our universe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I will give this a go but will be doing this a little bit more freely as this paragraph is too technical to just replace the bold words in layman’s terms IMO. </p>
<p>Spacetime is governed by its geometry which can be mathematically encoded in an object called the “metric tensor”. To understand this consider the example of an apple falling from a tree. Newton will tell you that the apple is experiencing gravity as a force which accelerates the apple towards the bottom. But according to Einstein in general relativity gravity is not a force between two objects (here earth and apple), but instead a fundamental property of spacetime due to the curvature present in spacetime. This curvature is determined by all the stuff that exists in the spacetime and this information is stored in the ‘metric tensor’. Thus, gravity is not a force per se on top of some background that exists but instead it is a property of that background itself. </p>
<p>Now that we have established the background we can put stuff in it namely fermions. Those are particles with half integer spin with the quantum mechanical habit of not being able to occupy the same energy state. A little bit like all of us while socially distancing. Fermions are the counterpart to bosons which are integer spin particles and they can all be in the same energy state. Think NY subway before COVID19. </p>
<p>We know that the fundamental particles that exist in nature and make up all the other stuff are fermions (examples are electrons or quarks that you may have heard of). Thus, these fermions live on the background dictated by the curvature of space time and they talk to each other via fundamental forces. The force carriers are gauge bosons, which differ in their properties depending on which of the fundamental forces you consider. These properties are determined by the underlying symmetries that exist in our universe, which we can label by specifying the gauge group. </p>
<p>This is meaningful because it describes the fundamental physics interactions in nature by understanding the underlying symmetries. That being said, personally I would not call this the most beautiful paragraph in physics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>(1) We usually measure things with a straight-edge ruler. In space-time, we measure with a ruler that is curved. </p>
<p>(2) There are numbers where 1+1 is not equal to 2, such as  2 + 3 is not the same as 3 + 2. If we take two curved rulers from space-time, they are not the same shape. </p>
<p>(3) (correction) Electrons are a part of a group of things called Fermions. They also give us electricity and cool things like computers. But, unlike electrons, light doesn’t follow the rules similar to what you do in musical chairs. In analogy, light allows two people to sit in one chair at a time. </p>
<p>Now combine all three ideas for imagining how light moves through space time. If an object moves slow, then everything is nice like us. If this something moves really fast, then the rules change.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lets say you're stressing about your weight. You spend a good portion of your day thinking about how you should lose weight, how you've been putting it off, how it's going to get worse if you don't do something about it now, etc. This primes your brain on the topic.</p>
<p>You meet up with your friend Phil for lunch. He makes a decadent menu selection and mentions: &quot;I know I should be watching my weight, but I'm going to treat myself this once.&quot; Since your brain was already thinking about all the reasons why you should lose weight, it's rather easy to rattle them all off on Phil. In fact, Phil is a much easier target to vent those frustrations on since telling someone what needs to be done is worlds easier than doing so yourself.</p>
<p>As another example: You're cheating on your spouse. Because of this, you're extra mindful about all the techniques for hiding an affair. Your spouse then announces she's going out with her friends later, and this makes you more suspicious than you would be otherwise because you thought of using that exact excuse to cover up your cheating.</p>
<p>Mental priming is one possible pathway for projection to occur. I understand it would be rather difficult to test if this is in fact the case, but it's what I find most plausible.</p>
<p>I think it's worth noting that the thought &quot;This bad thing I'm doing must actually be pretty common&quot; helps sooth guilt over doing the bad thing and create the perception that the activity is more prevalent than it actually is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<ol>
<li><strong>It's all in HOW you think of the world.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Cheaters tend to think it's easy to cheat and therefore think that everyone else thinks like them. That means that when a non-cheater does anything the cheaters have used before to cheat (even if it's perfectly innocent) that's where their mind is going to go.</p>
<p>People who believe the worst of others or believe that others have bad qualities often HAVE those qualities. Because when we try to think of how others think, we only have ourselves as a reference.</p>
<p>2) <strong>If everyone's a dick and they only think of themselves, then you're only defending yourself in a crapsack world. This feels good and is easy. Realizing you need fixing and doing it is hard.</strong></p>
<p>When you believe everyone is only out for themselves, it gives you permission to be out for yourself, and everyone else who pretends otherwise is doing the same as you--performing goodness so as not to be caught out as selfish.</p>
<p>We all have that friend who says everyone is a bitch or an asshole or all the men/women they have dated are insane, while they don't seem to notice what all those mean people have in common is THEM. Therefore they protect their own ego from the realization that it is them, and not the rest of humanity/all women/all men.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Just because you think everyone is great/nice/really good at heart/in love with you, doesn't mean they are. This too, is a failure at empathy.</strong></p>
<p>There are plenty of people out there who project good qualities or positive feelings on everyone they meet. These are the people who say &quot;All mothers love their children&quot; or &quot;I just know he cares about me because he texted me that one time.&quot; Note that this does not make you a pure and good person. It can make you a stalker...</p>
<p>4) <strong>Everyone projects to some extent. (Though not always in the clinical sense of the word). It would be insane not to.</strong></p>
<p>When humans want something from other humans, they try to gauge what those other humans are feeling. When you put yourself in someone else's shoes, you're still YOU, reacting to what you think their life and situation is. When that attempt at empathy goes wrong, you'll believe that their reaction isn't warranted or you'll think that you have a bead on what they are feeling and how they are thinking when you actually do not.</p>
<p>This is part of survival. Because one of the most dangerous things to humans is...other humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's only one person on the planet whose head you can look into; yourself. Now, imagine you observe certain internal factors manifesting themselves in certain ways in your behaviour. Now, imagine further you see others display that behaviour. If you don't have any deeper knowledge on all the factors that might be in play when a person displays that specific behaviour or simply don't think about it too hard, naturally, the most obvious assumption would be 'must be for the same reason as with me'.</p>
<p>You only draw conclusions about the world from things you know and, if you're a chronic cheater and your spouse suddenly starts acting all secretive, what do you think what possible explanation would come to your mind most immediately? Probably not that they must be planning a birthday surprise.</p>
<p>I think it's a mistake, however, to assume that all forms of projection must always be direct results of the 'projector', if you will, trying to deny a flaw in themself or to distract from it. It's really just an outgrowth of our constant efforts to understand others by checking against the database of our own experiences.</p>
<p>Projection doesn't even always necessarily involve any negative traits at all.</p>
<p>Say someone tweets about their mother having passed away and receives messages of condolences. But, as it turns out, it was more of a celebration tweet than one done in mourning since the mother in question was an abusive piece of shit. There you have an example of the exact same psychological mechanism. The person going &quot;so sorry about your mother. thoughts and prayers&quot; simply inferred from their own experiences what is most likely. Or, more simply put, they projected their own love for their own mother onto this other person who they had no reason to think doesn't share that particular trait.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

First type belongs to the ones that are not so smart so they cant view it in other persons perspective, naturally falling back on their own vission as a consequence. The other feel like you should buclkle under preassure and accept their point of view so they project in the atempt to convert you. But imo both stem from ego any way since the ego is responcible for their lack of empathy so they treat you like an inferior beign. Every other type of person not covered by my awfull generalisation wants to do this but checks their ego and decides not to do it.

Happens when our eyes are opened for too long or we are wearing contact lenses too much or just eyes dry. The eyes from far away appears to be pinkish/red due to these vessels being more visible than before.</p>
<p>I don't think this was really discussed at school at all actually but that's the train of thought!</p>
<p>Edit: Someone mentioned the use of visine, EXCELLENT POINT that i want to add (because i&quot;m constantly telling people): DON'T OVER USE VISINE. Tetrahydrozoline is the decongestant ingredient. Overuse causes REBOUND REDNESS, the opposite of what you want. Visine makes your blood vessels constrict, which sounds like a good idea since vasodilation is  the culprit. But keeping a constant blood vessel tone is a delicate balance between vaso constriction/dilation. The constant Visine use tricks your eyes into thinking that it already reached that balance of vaso constriction/dilation, so now when you take the visine away (which did the constriction), your eyes will vasoDILATE because there is nothing to oppose it, causing the rebound redness. It's great if you use it once in a while for allergies/occasional redness, but it's not for long term. Also don't use it if you have family history of glaucoma.</p>
<p>Go for something more natural. Like artificial tears. (no specific brand recommended because YMMV for most of them).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, no. This <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robinandrews/2018/05/28/why-cant-we-artificially-drain-magma-chambers-to-stop-volcanic-eruptions/#279898f93d8d" target="_blank">forbes article</a>, written around the time of the 2018 Kilauea eruption, provides a pretty thorough take on a variety of 'Could we do <em>this</em> to stop <em>that</em>?' questions with relation to volcanoes. </p>
<p>This addresses both currently/soon to be erupting volcanoes and more lingering volcanic threats, but with regards to the former (since that was OPs question) it nicely highlights that (1) we aren't up to the task engineering wise to effectively 'plug' a volcano that is erupting, (2) drilling a volcano about to erupt to 'relieve pressure' is extremely problematic as magma plumbing systems are very complex (i.e. where would we drill?), magma is extremely hot (i.e. what are we going to drill with that's not going to melt/stop working?), and at best it just localizes the problem in a new place (i.e. how do you stop a blow out of an overpressurized magma well?), and (3) other strategies like bombing a volcano, if they did anything, would most likely just trigger an eruption.</p>
<p>Ultimately, for volcanoes, as with the majority of geologic hazards, our best strategies are monitoring (i.e. keeping a close tab on the status of systems so that we know problems are imminent), mitigation (i.e. modifying building habits, location, etc to better withstand or avoid the hazard in question), and communication (i.e. making sure the public is aware of the hazards and what they should do during an event). The best and most prudent response to an erupting volcano is to get out of its way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pi is an irrational number. This means pi cannot be written as the ratio of two integers. There are many proofs to show pi is irrational. but they are all pretty involved, and not really ELI5. There is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_that_%CF%80_is_irrational" target="_blank">wiki page on it</a>.</p>
<p>One of the properties of <em>all</em> irrational numbers (not just pi) is that they will always have non-ending and non-repeating decimal parts. The proof for this is much easier, but I'll work through a specific example, and the proof is just the general version of it.</p>
<hr />
<p>Proving irrational numbers must NOT end or repeat is the same as showing that every decimal that DOES end or repeat is not irrational (i.e. is rational).</p>
<p>EDIT to clarify 'repeating': By repeating I mean that eventually the decimals have a repeating sequence of digits, and once the repeating starts it goes on forever. </p>
<p>So 1.9876456456... doesn't repeat in the beginning, but eventually has the repeating &quot;456&quot; forever (and so it rational). And 1.2222229037... does repeat in the beginning, but eventually stops (so is irrational).</p>
<p>If the decimal ends:</p>
<p>Say x = 14.4245. Multiply by 10^4 = 10000 to get rid of the decimal part. You get 144245. To get the original number back, just divide again by 10^4: 144245/10000. Since both the numerator and denominator are integers, the original number was rational. You can generalize this to show any decimal that ends is rational by multiplying and dividing by the appropriate power of 10 to ger rid of the decimal part.</p>
<p>If the decimal never ends, but repeats:</p>
<p>Say x = 14.5124874874874... (the 874 keeps repeating). </p>
<p>Then</p>
<p>10^4 * x = 145124.874874...   (so only the repeating part is after the decimal)</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>10^7 * x = 145124874.874874...   (so there is just one repeating pattern before decimal)</p>
<p>Then subtract:</p>
<p>10^(7)x - 10^(4)x  = 145124874.874874... - 145124.874874...  </p>
<p>x * (10^7 - 10^(4))  =  145124874.874874... - 145124.874874...  </p>
<p>x = (145124874.874874... - 145124.874874...) / (10^7 - 10^4)</p>
<p>Since the numerator is an integer (the decimal parts are the same and so subtract away), and the denominator is an integer, x is a rational number. You can generalize this to show that any decimal that has a repeating part is rational by multiplying by the appropriate powers of 10.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Words to know: an irrational number, like pi, is &quot;endless.&quot; A rational number, like 1/2, can be expressed as the ratio of two whole numbers. Irrational numbers are everything else. All numbers are one or the other, but not both. 1/3 is rational even though if you write it as a decimal the decimal never ends.</p>
<p>Short answer: A common way is what is called proof by contradiction. We pretend that the irrational number is actually rational and show that means something impossible is true (like 1==0). Since that can't be the case, the number isn't rational. Therefore it is irrational.</p>
<p>Such proofs tend to be fairly technical so it's hard to do an ELI5 for them. Wikipedia has several proofs for sqrt(2) being irrational. I remember a fairly straightforward proof by contradiction in my abstract math textbook, but I no longer have it and I don't see it on the wikipedia page. I think it was similar to the proof by infinite descent but its been years.</p>
<p>EDIT: Yes, your &quot;I'm only five&quot; comments are all original and hilarious. Rule 4. There is a reason we don't teach abstract math to actual 5 year olds. But I can add a less complete explanation that hopefully gets the point across:</p>
<p>To prove an irrational number c is irrational, we assume that it actually wasn't irrational. This means we can find two counting numbers a and b, where a/b=c. We then do some math with a and b to show that if a and b exist, 0=1. Since 0 does not actually equal 1, a and b can't exist. So c has to be irrational.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>We imagine what pi would be like if it did have an end, and then look at things that MUST be true for this pi-with-an-end. Pretty soon we'll see one of these facts says the opposite of one of the rules we were working with in the first place, so we can't have pi-with-an-end in this game without dropping a rule we need or adding an ugly exception for no good reason.</p>
<p>This is similar to when people say dividing by 0 is undefined. We could add a rule to make it mean something, but one of the consequences for the game is that we can then prove ANY number to be equal to any other number, like 1 = 2. A game with those rules doesn't have much else to do, so nobody plays in it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

You prove it mathematically! The math is rather involved so I’ll give a high-level explanation and link a proof if you want to dive deeper.</p>
<p>For this specific proof you pretend that it is a Rational number and then set up a case where you can show that the math breaks down into impossibilities. For example in <a href="https://mindyourdecisions.com/blog/2013/11/08/proving-pi-is-irrational-a-step-by-step-guide-to-a-simple-proof/" target="_blank">this proof</a> they show that if pi is rational, then the function they set up evaluates to a number that is both between 0 and 1, and also an integer. Which is clearly impossible. And since the only assumption being made is that pi is rational, you know it’s false.</p>
<p>In general, this strategy of proof is called a proof by contradiction. You assume that A is true and then prove that If A is true then it leads to something that isn’t possible. You’re looking for holes in your own theory. </p>
<p>Yeah I know this isn’t exactly explaining the math, it’s just more of a breakdown of proofs in general. I still think it’s a decent explanation of how we can KNOW that pi is irrational.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Scientists publish their findings in peer reviewed journals, which means you submit your paper to a journal and then usually 3 other scientists working in a similar field review the paper for accuracy, make sure your methods make sense, see if you're drawing incorrect conclusions, etc. Their monkey research findings will be published with these standards. The actual process of designing and undertaking clinical trials, and the methods for determining efficacy and safety, are regulated very tightly by government organizations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>For a project of this magnitude, it will not be hard to find scientists to drop what they're doing and lend their time.</p>
<p>As pointed out already, this group apparently justified moving quickly to larger scale trials because of prior related work.  It's great news.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I’ve been a lab tech in a couple different vaccine research labs for the past 3 years. As such, I definitely still consider myself a “fledgeling” in the field and am by no means an expert. That being said here’s my answer based on my experience so far, with some background info on vaccines if you’re interested.</p>
<p>In order to understand the timeline of vaccine research and how it can be streamlined, I think it’s important to understand the components of a vaccine. If you already have a good understanding you can probably just skip this whole paragraph. For those of you not familiar though, a vaccine platform basically consists of two or three components. The first is the antigen(s), which is generally either a piece of the pathogen or a protein/molecule engineered to mimic a piece of the pathogen. This is what you generate antibodies against so that your body recognizes the pathogen when you get infected for real. The second component is the adjuvant. An adjuvant is basically a compound or molecule that your body can <em>immediately</em> recognize as foreign and dangerous. It essentially is what tells your immune system that it needs to mount an immune response to the antigen and how that response should be carried out. It should also be noted that an adjuvant does NOT have to be from the pathogen your are immunizing against, and very often is not. The third component is the vector or method of delivery. Old school vaccines, such as heat-killed or some live-attenuated (weakened) pathogens, don’t really have a vector per se since you’re just being injected with the virus/bacteria/etc that causes the disease. Most “new age” vaccines however have some sort of special delivery mechanism in order to tailor or boost the immune response, or just for safety reasons.</p>
<p>Anyways if you’re still bearing with me, adjuvants and vectors need to be studied extensively outside of animals and in a “lower” animal model such as rodents before you have any chance of pairing them with a specific antigen and putting them in primates, let alone humans. Most adjuvants and vectors undergo years of testing for toxicity, dosage, efficacy, how they work mechanistically, etc before they’re ever used in a real vaccine. This in my opinion is easily the most time-consuming part of creating a vaccine.</p>
<p>With a lot of these COVID vaccines being researched however, they’ve already extensively tested their adjuvant/vector systems prior to this outbreak. Some of them are even luckier in that they’ve already tested for vaccine efficacy in humans/primates in the context of other diseases, such as Ebola (I.e. they already used the same adjuvant and vector in humans/primates but with a different antigen). Even luckier still are those like this lab that were actually testing their vaccine for another closely related Coronavirus. In theory, a vaccine that elicits a type of immune response that is protective against one pathogen is very likely to be protective against a similar pathogen, since the two pathogens should act fairly similarly on the body. All of these factors essentially allow COVID vaccine researchers to essentially skip steps in the process so that they can begin primate studies much quicker, since they already know the <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> of how their vaccine will work. The antigen on the other hand generally doesn’t require nearly as much independent study, other than that it will not cause any dose-dependent adverse effects, because most antigens are relatively inert on their own.</p>
<p>A typical primate study, in my experience will last at least a few months, sometimes as long as a year. If none of the animals show adverse reactions to either the pathogen OR the vaccine itself, that’s a pretty good indication you’re ready to move to human trials. Here’s a general checklist of things that are looked for in primate studies: Does the vaccine confer protection? Does the vaccine cause any adverse effects? How soon before/after infection does the vaccine need to be administered before you see a drop in efficacy? Does the vaccine confer lasting protection, or will you be able to get sick after some amount of time later? Is a booster injection necessary? Is there any danger in repeat exposures to the vaccine? Is there any danger in vaccinating an animal who has already been infected and recovered previously? If you design your experiments efficiently, I’d say the primate phase could be over in around 6 months.</p>
<p>I’ve never worked directly with any human trials, but basically they look at many of the same questions asked in primate studies but start in a very small group of humans before scaling up. Furthermore, in humans you can focus on specific variables such as gender or health problems that may affect how the vaccine works. Human trials happen in phases, the sum of which usually lasts a year or two, which is generally dependent on urgency, the number of available test subjects, scalability of the vaccine production, etc.</p>
<p>Anyways that’s my very long-winded, nitty-gritty explanation. TL;DR most of the researchers you’re hearing about in the news have already extensively tested 2/3 of their vaccine prior to the outbreak and now just need to verify that it works with a new antigen. This can be done normally in about 2 years if done efficiently and all goes well, but due to the urgency and ample number of test subjects, can probably be streamlined to a year in an absolute best case scenario</p>
<p>Bonus factoid, the vaccine platform they’re using in the study you linked is known as an Adenovirus vector. Basically it’s a different, mostly harmless virus that has been genetically modified to express a COVID protein (the antigen). This vaccine platform was studied extensively during the Ebola outbreak earlier in the decade and was a vaccine front runner for Ebola, along with the rVSV platform (another harmless virus genetically engineered to express COVID protein/antigen) which if I’m not mistaken is what they ended up using  towards the tail-end of the outbreak.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Most other teams have had to start with small clinical trials of a few hundred participants to demonstrate safety. But scientists at the university’s Jenner Institute had a head start on a vaccine, having proved in previous trials that similar inoculations — including one last year against an earlier coronavirus — were harmless to humans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Armed with safety data from their human trials of similar vaccines for Ebola, MERS and malaria, though, the scientists at Oxford’s institute <strong>persuaded British regulators to allow unusually accelerated trials while the epidemic is still hot around them</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So who knows if the FDA will allows those vaccines to be used in the US if the trials prove successful. On a related note, the article also mentions this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Donors are currently spending tens of millions of dollars to start the manufacturing process at facilities in Britain and the Netherlands even before the vaccine is proven to work, said Sandy Douglas, 37, a doctor at Oxford overseeing vaccine production.</p>
<p>“There is no alternative,” he said.</p>
<p>But the team has <strong>not yet reached an agreement with a North American manufacturer, in part because the major pharmaceutical companies there typically demand exclusive worldwide rights before investing in a potential medicine.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don't know how true that claim is, though. Obviously would be very maddening if that's the case, but who knows if the other &quot;part&quot; of the reason they left out is FDA regulations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, light is a photon, and it gets emitted by something (like a star) and it travels at ~300,000 km/sec in a vacuum. I can understand this. Gravity on the other hand, as I understand it, isn't something that's emitted like some kind of tractor beam, it's a deformation in the fabric of the universe caused by a massive object. So, what I'm wondering is, is there a limit to the range at which this deformation has an effect. Does a big thing like a black hole not only have stronger gravity in general but also have the effects of it's gravity be felt further out than a small thing like my cat? Or does every massive object in the universe have some gravitational influence on every other object, if very neglegable, even if it's a great distance away? And if so, does that gravity move at some kind of speed, and how would it change if say two black holes merged into a bigger one? Additional mass isn't being created in such an event, but is &quot;new gravity&quot; being generated somehow that would then spread out from the merged object?</p>
<p>I realize that it's entirely possible that my concept of gravity is way off so please correct me if that's the case. This is something that's always interested me but I could never wrap my head around.</p>
<p>Edit:  I did not expect this question to blow up like this, this is amazing.  I've already learned more from reading some of these comments than I did in my senior year physics class.  I'd like to reply with a thank you to everyone's comments but that would take a lot of time, so let me just say &quot;thank you&quot; to all for sharing your knowledge here.  I'll probably be reading this thread for days.  Also special &quot;thank you&quot; to the individuals who sent silver and gold my way, I've never had that happen on Reddit before.</p></div></div>

<p>Every piece of matter in the universe is attracted to every other piece of matter in the universe. And when wild things happen, like neutron stars merging, the hiccup in gravity you feel from them spiraling into each other at half the speed of light arrives in almost lockstep with the light from the explosion from the matter they fling off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you’re wondering why would gravity waves just so happen to have the same speed as light, even though they would not seem to have a direct relationship, it’s because the speed of light is not actually specifically about light; it’s about <em>causality.</em>  Calculations show that if any kind of information-bearing phenomenon whatsoever were to travel faster than this, causality would be violated.  Which would mean that consequences could precede their own causes — i.e. time travel.  </p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/msVuCEs8Ydo" target="_blank">This YouTube video</a> has an excellent explanation of this. </p>
<p>Light is what we normally refer to for this speed simply because it’s readily accessible/understandable, and is relatively easy to measure.  But in general, any wave in any massless field <em>must</em> propagate at the speed of light (causality); only phenomena that are associated with mass are ever able to travel slower than that.  </p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/gSKzgpt4HBU" target="_blank">This video</a>  from the same channel explains this part really well.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modern consensus is gravity moves at the speed of light. There is no distance limit except for distances so great that the accumulated expansion of space is moving things apart faster than light; but gravity gets weaker with distance, so for stuff very far away the effect is negligible.</p>
<p>When blackholes merge, the resulting gravity matches the sum of the two blackhole gravities almost exactly, but there is some loss of mass in the form of the gravitational waves emitted during the downspiral. There isn't a sudden change in the deformation, the gravity of multiple objects overlap, the distortions add up; so as blackholes get closer and closer, the overall deformation gradually transitions towards matching the end result.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
