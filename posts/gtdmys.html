		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Normally air is not conductive, but when a large enough voltage is applied it becomes ionized and conductive. Lightning is just a narrow path of air becoming ionized and allowing current to flow.</p>
<p>Air's resistance drops as more of it becomes ionized. Assuming that all lightning produces the same ion density, then the current capacity of the lighting would scale with the square of lightning diameter. For example a lighting with 4x current would only have 2x large diameter.</p>
<p>However lightning with larger voltage differences would have the ability to ionize more of the air. So in reality, a high voltage / high current lightning strike would probably see have a smaller increase in diameter than one would expect from the current alone.</p>
<p>High voltage/low current lightning would have a small diameter. Low voltage/high current lightning would have a large diameter. The composition of the air makes a large difference too. So it is not as straightforward as powerful lightning = bigger diameter.</p>
<p>Typical lightning strike diameter is 1-2 inches to give an idea of scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to the UK met Office, lightning bolts are around 2-3cm thick, and 2-3 miles long.  The energy dissipated in a bolt does not appear to be related to the channel width, but more energetic storm systems will generate many more strikes per hour than low energy systems.  <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/learn-about/weather/types-of-weather/thunder-and-lightning/facts-about-lightning" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/learn-about/weather/types-of-weather/thunder-and-lightning/facts-about-lightning" target="_blank">https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/learn-about/weather/types-of-weather/thunder-and-lightning/facts-about-lightning</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As noted, on the order of inches.  However, the dynamics of lighting are quite interesting, because there are two competing effects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Heating of air to many thousands of degrees, ionizing it into an incandescent plasma.  (This pushes it apart).</li>
<li>The &quot;z pinch&quot;.  The flowing electric charge creates a magnetic field.  This field interacts with the charge on the outside of the bolt, pushing it inwards.</li>
</ol>
<p>More current both puts more energy into the air, and also compresses it further.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>When searching for more pics online, beware that some photos labeled as such are actually just wet sand that people have dribbled onto driftwood or other items to resemble a fulgurite..</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
