		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, this pattern plays out throughout all of biology. </p>
<p>Herbivores eat pretty much every waking second.</p>
<p>Carnivores/Omnivores, preferring more nutritionally dense food like meat, don't have to eat all the time.</p>
<p>Once humans figured out how to cook food, this pattern breaks itself. Because we aren't massively big or strong, we don't need too much food. Because cooked food provides more energy, we don't need to eat as often. That meant we had a lot of free time to do other stuff, and anthropologists believe that this is where the first vestiges of society were born.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since the question references how these animals maintain so much muscle mass in particular from a diet consisting seemingly of little protein, I’ll explain to the best of my knowledge.</p>
<p>For starters, the hay etc that horses eat probably has more protein than you’d think, but eating protein is not a prerequisite for muscle mass. A lot of people think that eating protein builds muscle, that eating fat adds fat, etc but this is inherently wrong. </p>
<p>The mammalian metabolism is remarkable at its ability to generate the macronutrients it needs from other macronutrients. Non-mammalian animals might be too but I’ve never studied them. For example, when humans eat carbohydrates and fats, they are often broken down into a smaller molecule called acetyl CoA. This smaller molecule is like a LEGO block in that it can then be used to make many other molecules that the body needs, including many of the amino acids that the body needs to build protein. There are several amino acids which are labeled as “essential” which means that humans can’t synthesize them from fats, sugars, or other proteins and thus they must be consumed in the diet. Whether horses have amino acids that they can’t synthesize from carbohydrates is something I’m not sure of. There are remarkable differences in metabolic capabilities between different mammals.</p>
<p>In terms of the way that horses constantly eat (“graze”) all day, this also has a role in their ability to pack on tons of muscle. As we eat, our insulin goes up and certain types of molecules (like leucine) enter our bodies. Insulin and leucine have the effect of activating a protein complex in our cells called mTORC1. When mTOTC1 is active, our bodies build themselves up by adding on muscle and storing glycogen (and packing on fat if we exceed the amount of energy we need to function from day to day). Since horses eat all day, their bodies would be in the “build muscle” mode all day. Since horses stand and walk around and don’t lay on the couch all day drinking soda and eating chips, they manage to mostly build muscle rather than fat. The sequence of events I’ve just mentioned is also one of the reasons you don’t want to eat within 4 hours of going to bed. Doing so activates you’re “let’s build fat” function in your cells and thus instead of burning energy while you sleep you actually just store it up (as fat).</p>
<p>TL;DR: horses (and humans) can make proteins from carbohydrates and fats, and since horses have a healthy diet and stand/move around all day they create lots of muscle. </p>
<p>Disclaimer: I am not a horse physiology expert so feel free to correct me if I’m wrong. I did study human metabolism however and thus am extrapolating it to horses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>All the BIG animals are herbivores, since they need multiple, big stomachs to squeeze out every last nutrient from their diet.</p>
<p>Even little rabbits have have to eat their own poop to ensure they get every calorie. </p>
<p>They also need to eat a constantly. In order to be safe from preditors while busy eating, they need to be small and fast (e.g. rabbits, mice) or just too big to hunt (e.g. rhinos). ~~ They're aren't too many midsized herbivores. ~~ [EDIT: I'm an idiot. Thanks for pointing out the exists of deer.] </p>
<p>That plus their hormones are doing things our hormones can't even imagine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
