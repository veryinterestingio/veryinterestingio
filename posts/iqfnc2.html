		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Tanning is literally letting the DNA of your melanocytes be damaged by UV radiation. Enough of that and chances are one of the genes damaged is an oncogene which stops dividing cells from becoming cancerous. Then you have a melanoma on your hands and shit gets very serious, very quickly. See your doctor if you have a new mole, people.</p>
<p>If you have dark skin the melanin already there absorbs the UV to a point but when the UV radiation oxidizes the melanin the products can still cause oxidative stress which can do damage to DNA. This is why black people can still get skin cancer but at far less rates than white people in high UV environments (i.e. Australia).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. This is why it is said that using a tanning bed increases your risk for skin cancer so much. It’s even warned within the tanning salon. It is also on tanning oil bottles, and, of course, sunscreen. </p>
<p>Your skin cells don’t have the ability to kill themselves <em>because</em> they want to prevent cancer. They are damaged, so they die. Damaged cells are not useful for the body. The epithelial tissue (skin), is specialized to be constantly generating new cells to replace dead ones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I was a kid I lived in New Zealand, where the ozone layer is basically non-existent so UV levels are extremely high.  Even on an overcast day you can get burnt if not wearing suncream.</p>
<p>From being there I must have got burnt at some point because now I have a fuck ton of moles on my body.  Apparently I'm at a greater risk of skin cancers because of this, although I'm not sure if the moles are the risk or an indicator of the risk.</p>
<p>I'd recommend anyone to wear suncream on a bright day.  You can still tan- I usually wear factor 50 and still get tanned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
