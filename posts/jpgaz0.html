This capacity to sequester contaminants, however, is limited, necessitating periodic oil changes to keep an engine from wearing out prematurely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A piston on an ICE has to withstand several high-pressure fuel explosions a second, within tolerances of fractions of millimetres, being propelled away by those explosions at immense speeds, only to rise again just as fast to form a perfect air-tight seal enough to contain the next explosion.</p>
<p>It has to do all this at variable speeds, variable size explosions, tens or hundreds of thousands of times a day while at no point EVER allowing part of the metals it's made of to rub even a tiny bit against its container or anything else.</p>
<p>Inevitably, the only way to do this is to be completely lubricated, and the explosions burn through the oil leaving carbon and other deposits in it - which means oil filters, oil changes and oil loss over time.</p>
<p>An electric motor?  It's a coil of copper floating inside an empty space with a bunch of magnets around the edge of it.  The only part that contacts AND moves is a small part of a rod that is connected to that coil, that turns when the coil turns, where that rod passes out the motor through a small hole to drive something else.  That doesn't even need to be hermetically-sealed.  And all the oil has to do it stop the spinning rod - that's rotating and not moving up, down, forward, back, left or right at all - from touching the outer ring.  You can literally contain that movement inside a rubberised or lubricated barrier.</p>
<p>Exactly the same tech, for example, as in your electric toothbrush (when was the last time  you oiled that?), shaver, scalextric cars, your kitchen blender, millions of toys, power tools (some you may have to lubricate but when did you last oil your electric drill?),  anything that has an electric motor.  Just has bigger, better magnets, that's all.</p>
<p>An ICE has gases, explosions, heat, metal expansion, vibration, and large reciprocating vertical motions, all kinds to deal with.</p>
<p>An electric motor spins in the air with only the tiniest part of it in contact when the rod is spinning through a hole in the side of the motor housing (and that's mainly just to hold the whole thing steady and away from the magnets).  There are none of the challenges of an ICE or even an hermetically-sealed system like an ICE has to be.</p>
<p>Imagine installing a hook on a wall, one that only needs to twist around.  It can be rotated in a holder to do its job but can't pull out or in - it just spins around.  It never has any weight on it.<br />
How much would you have to lubricate it for even a lifetime's use, enough that people can twist the hook around but not pull it out or hang anything off it?  Just enough so that it doesn't start to wear through the outer casing, basically.</p>
<p>Now imagine installing a metal socket instead of a hook into which you expect people to rapidly insert and reinsert a giant lump of metal directly a dozen times a second for hours on end every day for years, and if they're even a fraction of a millimeter out when they push, it's metal-on-metal.  You're literally pushing all the oil in or out of your seal all the time.  It's much harder.</p>
<p>Now imagine the hook can afford to wiggle a bit and doesn't need to worry about air escaping from the other side.  But the socket cannot move at all, and there are constant pressurised gas explosions happening on the other side of it all the time.</p>
<p>The hook is basically always &quot;wall temperature&quot;, maybe a little warmer.  The socket is going to be operating at hundreds of degrees.</p>
<p>The hook doesn't care if the wall wobbles a bit.  The socket will angle and the piston will hit the sides if you haven't bolted it down enough, and only the oil will save it and cushion that movement.</p>
<p>The hook wouldn't even get dirty.  The socket has literal explosions happening inside it all the time dirtying the insides, the join, the oil, and forming layers of detritus inside and outside as the piston moves.</p>
<p>It's a very, very, different task.  Pistons are feats of engineering honed over decades, centuries.  An electric motor is a wire inside a magnet in an empty box.  Simpler tech, harder to get lots of power out of it (until recently with high power electrics and extremely strong magnets), but far less requirement for precision engineering and far less friction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ICEs continuously burn away their oil as it gets smeared onto the wall of the cylinders and lit up when the piston goes down. There are also so many many MANY moving bits grinding metal dust into the oil.</p>
<p>In an electric motor there is only a single enclosed bearing that actually experiences friction. It gets by with a lot less greasing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heat is the limiting issue, I’d reckon. Electric motor will heat up a little via friction and lost electrical energy, but it’s not gonna generate nearly what combusting fuel will.</p>
<p>Also probably some hand me downs in use coming from car engines. Meaning that say someone made an oil that didn’t start breaking down til 500 degrees, for a combustion engine. So it’s not gonna break down in an engine that only gets to 250.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
