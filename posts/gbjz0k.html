		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On almost any device with processor and RAM (pretty much anything these days), holding the power key for 10+ seconds will force a hard power cycle - like physically turning it off and on again. </p>
<p>Problem is, when computers (or phones, or tablets) are running, there are files open. Some may be being written to. Some may be critical system files. In general, interrupting file writes is a bad thing - at best you're just missing the data that may not have been saved yet, at worst the file system entries that describe the file and where on the storage device it resides get messed up and the file is badly corrupted or badly mangled. Shutting down or rebooting the device properly with a tap/command and &quot;yes&quot; after the prompt will give the operating system of the device time to properly save and close all files. </p>
<p>In reality however, most modern operating systems are designed to be relatively fault tolerant of this. I haven't had a corrupt system file issue from a hard reset in close to 10 years not since moving to Windows 7. And I've never noticed such a problem on a smart phone or tablet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't call it &quot;unsafe&quot;. 99% of the time, holding down the power button to shut off a PC will not result in any ill effects. Sometimes, when the computer is frozen, it's the best way to shut the computer off, and is probably safer than just pulling the plug.</p>
<p>The reason it's not a good idea to do it if you don't have to, is that it interrupts whatever the computer's doing and tells it to JUST STOP. This can be a problem if the computer happened to be re-writing an important system file at the time, because this could leave the file half-written, and in rare cases the computer might not be able to figure out how to fix the file when you start it back up.</p>
<p>It's a good idea to take a look at the hard drive activity light (the light that flashes or flickers to indicate the computer is &quot;thinking&quot;) and only shut off the computer if the light is blinking rarely or not at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This is essentially what <del>shitting</del> <em>shutting</em> down a computer does</p>
<p>If you hold the power button it’s essentially the equivalent of being kicked out of the library with no advice and having everything you were working on thrown out. Some work will be lost</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most hardware can take it and nothing will happen, except for a few electromechanical devices that won’t have enough time to park some moveable parts, like hard disks (still pretty safe most of the time too).</p>
<p>The problem is software. In modern computers the primary memory (the only memory the processors have direct access to) are RAMs, or random access memory, a type of memory that is volatile, that’s is, without power, all memory is lost. Only secondary memories, like HDs, SSDs, flash drivers, etc. aren’t volatile. The reason is simple: RAM is up to 20 thousand times faster than secondary storage. That’s why it’s primary.</p>
<p>This also means that for efficiency purposes and so that users don’t keep waiting for disk writes (they once waited for slow floppy disks to complete !), when writing files, they stay on hold in RAM, while in background they’re being written to non volatile storage. This happens very frequently, so that it will be very common for files to be partially written.</p>
<p>If you switch power off after writing a document, you might lose the file you thought you’ve saved. If you switch power off during a system update, then we might be talking about an incomplete program necessary to boot or even mixed old and new programs, possibly incompatible with each other, in the system.</p>
<p>There are many ways to reduce the damage, though, the most famous is the use of “journaling file systems”, which are able to write files and the file system structures in two steps, with the help of a journal stored in disk. In case of a system failure the journal can be used as an efficient redundant indicator that the file was or was not fully written. It guarantees that there will be no garbage in the file, but can only protect it in chunks: either all data was written or all data in the chunk was lost. So it’s not a silver bullet.</p>
<p>That’s why most systems have an unmount or eject command for pen drives and they complain if the pen drive is removed “unsafely”. Also, most operating systems will try to write to pen drives synchronously, immediately copying contents from RAM to the disk and even blocking further operations on it until all data is written.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are (basically) two types of memory, RAM and your hard drive. RAM is really fast, but when it loses power it forgets everything. The hard drive is really slow, but holds information even when the power is turned off. When your computer is working, it holds most of what it's doing in RAM, because it's a lot faster. Every now and then, it writes stuff to the hard drive to store for later. You can force this to happen by saving a document or installing a program, but dozens of programs (and your operating system) are doing this behind the scenes without telling you. </p>
<p>Now imagine there was some file with some information, like the current president. In the hard drive, the file says &quot;Barack Obama&quot;. Something opens that file (pulling it into RAM), changes the contents to say &quot;Donald Trump&quot;. You save the file to the hard drive, and the system starts writing one letter at a time. &quot;Darack Obama&quot; -&gt; &quot;Dorack Obama&quot; -&gt; &quot;Donack Obama&quot; and so on. If you turned the computer off while it was writing the letters in, it would just stop where ever it happened to be, maybe thinking the current president was &quot;Donald Obama&quot;. Depending on what program opened that file later, it may not understand who &quot;Donald Obama&quot; is, and crash the program.</p>
<p>But some other program might recognize &quot;Donald Obama&quot;, and pull up the fanfic I'm writing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
