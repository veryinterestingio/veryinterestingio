		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR: Flash is full of security holes and there are better ways to do what Flash does these days.</p>
<p>Flash was invented in 1996 during an earlier era of the internet when browsers were much more limited.</p>
<p>Adobe Flash allowed for video playback, interactive components of websites, and flash based animations that were revolutionary at the time.</p>
<p>Flash resulted in a renaissance of sorts with flash based video games (newgrounds.com) and flash cartoons (Homestar Runner) becoming popular ways to waste time just as the internet was becoming common place.</p>
<p>So why are we killing it?</p>
<p>Because Flash is a dinosaur. The flash plugin is full of security holes and despite Adobe's hard work over the past few years to patch it the industry has moved on.</p>
<p>Newer technologies like HTML5 have taken it' place and are honestly better at doing what Flash used to do.</p>
<p>Continuing to use flash on your website today merely puts your website and your users at risk.</p>
<p>Adobe meanwhile is happy to be rid of it because they have been effectively handing it out for free for years now. They made their money selling tools that made flash based websites and games, but that well has long since dried up so to them spending money to patch an obsolete protocol is nothing more than an unnecessary cost. So they have willingly killed off their own product.</p>
<p>Basically we don't need it anymore and keeping it around is causing more problems than it's worth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The flash player, years ago, was primarily used to enable rich web content, such as video playback, to be placed into web pages when it couldn't be done using web standards at the time.  It also found use for online web browser games.</p>
<p>Many of its uses, such as video playback, were later supplemented by modern web standards (such as HTML5 and it's video element).</p>
<p>As it has fallen out of common use and is prone to security flaws, adobe has decided its no longer worth maintaining.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s interesting seeing all these comments on the history of Flash but I haven’t seen any mentions of Macromedia. Flash was developed by a small company and bought by Macromedia, an Adobe competitor who made multimedia authoring tools. Back in those days, multimedia meant CD-ROMs, something like a primitive modern website only static and housed on a CD. Macromedia seemed to see the writing on the wall and crafted Flash into the spiritual successor to their Director tool, which was mostly used for Cd-ROMs. They took Flash from obscurity and into ballooning popularity until Adobe bought them in 2005. Flash had become Macromedia’s crown jewel and for the most part Adobe axed all their other tools after the merger, so the general consensus was Adobe bought Macromedia to control Flash.</p>
<p>I’ve always wondered what would have happened if Adobe hadn’t bought Flash. In don’t think they were the worst steward of Flash but I always got the impression they let many aspects of it languish. Certainly, most of their other products (looking at you, Photoshop) have not progressed much during those 15 years. Seems to me that Macromedia were Adobe’s chief rival and because they were allowed to merge, we all got many years of Adobe market dominance where they just sat on their laurels and let the profits roll in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Flash was a rich media plugin for the early days of the internet when browser technologies and standards were far, far more primitive than they are now. In that era, browsers were generally only good for reading text, following links, and executing extremely simple javascript instructions or server calls. To watch a video, you had to actually download the file and play it back locally on your machine with your local player. Interactive content did exist, but was incredibly obtuse to build and maintain using the HTML and JS of the era, with very limited graphics rendering capability or dynamic content.</p>
<p>The principal thing Flash did, other than be one of the first easy-to-use in-browser video stream plugins, was make it easy to build interactive content and animations. Timeline animations and Actionscript were simple to use, easy to pick up by kids, and resulted in a huge boom of content on the internet, at a time where the only content your average person could 'add' to the internet would be a forum post on a BBS. Now you had a raft of games, videos, animations, voicework, just this huge flourishing of amateur content built by people for other people.</p>
<p>As internet standards caught up, Flash became obsolete as a way to develop rich media, as it was slow and proprietary. After a point there was nothing Flash could do that you couldn't do yourself with a bit of work in JS, and its ubiquity resulted in it being targetted constantly for attack by hackers. There was an era where the easiest way to compromise a machine was to feed it a fake Flash plugin update and get the user to update, or sneak a malicious flash microapp into an ad delivery network that would auto-load on a user's machine and compromise it. The final nail was when Steve Jobs refused to implement flash support in the iPhone.</p>
<p>It was never more than an intermediate stepping stone technology that helped bootstrap browsers into the multimedia delivery apps they are now, and for the time it did it's job well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other people have covered the what was it aspect, I’ll cover why it’s no longer being used. I worked at Apple when a lot of this was happening.</p>
<p>When Apple was developing the iPhone, they wanted to provide the best mobile computing experience they could. At the time, something like 90% of desktop Safari crashes originated in the Flash plugin, and it was a driver for calls to AppleCare, which was costing Apple money. And because it was a buggy mess, it was a primary vector for malware and other noxious code that wanted to gain access to your computer.</p>
<p>And it sucked power like nobody’s business, a Flash supporting browser could drain a laptop battery in a few hours; translated to a phone with a much smaller battery you’d need to plug the phone in by noon, which was something that was going to cause a PR shitstorm if the iPhone shipped that way. </p>
<p>All this probably wasn’t helped by the fact that there were engineers on the Apple payroll whose job was basically to babysit Adobe and try to clean up their buggy mess.</p>
<p>So the decision was made to not support Flash on iOS. It got a lot of criticism at the time, and Android actually tried to use “we support Flash” as a marketing point, but they ran hard into the battery drain issue and it got quietly shunted aside.</p>
<p>With mobile refusing/effectively unable to support Flash, and with an increasing percentage of website views coming from mobile platforms, Flash became less viable for websites: they’d be cutting off a lucrative chunk of their potential market since Apple users are more likely to pay for other things too. They could still use it for desktop systems, but they’d need to provide a mobile version too which doubled their workload, so a lot of them just dropped Flash in favor of the new HTML 5 which was adding support for a lot of things Flash had been used for, like video.</p>
<p>And that’s how and why Flash died.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
