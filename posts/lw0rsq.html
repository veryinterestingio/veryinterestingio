		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As you go over the bump, you experience a moment of weightlessness, and then you are effectively falling. This causes your guys to start &quot;floating&quot; around inside you. Of course they are all fairly held in place, but the slight movement can be felt. It's the same as if you've ever jumped off of something tall (like a diving board) and felt motion in your guts as you fell.</p>
<p>This happens because of inertia, as you start falling, your guts want to stay in place, so they move slightly upwards within your body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a bio student, but no med student. Other people who have pointed to the same organs you point to. I wonder how much the sensation comes from the brains processing of sensory input from the inner ear. The inner ear helps humans sense equilibrium and gives us a sense of balance. The (osseus) or &quot;bony labyrinth&quot; contains a complex setup of passages filled with fluid. As our head tilts, theis fluid responds and that response stimulates tiny hairs. The cells the hairs attach to convert this stimulation into a signal that can be sent to the brain. It seems possible that most of our stomach queasiness is generated by the brain's response to this information rather than since information from movement of the organs in our chest cavity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am far from an expert, and people have explained that your internal organs kind of ‘float’ in your body. I wanted to add some physics to it. The weightless sensation happens because the tracks are following the arc of a parabola. Imagine you throw a ball into the air. Gravity will overtake the force you put into it slowly, in the shape of parabola. On a roller coaster, you AND the car follow that same parabola. In normal gravity, you and the car are pushed together, but on a parabola, you’re falling at the same rate, and the force of being pushed together is gone. In your body, the same thing is happening. And your guts don’t like not feeling the gravity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body is wired to react this way from birth. Most babies have the so called moro reflex which means they throw their arms out when they feel like they are falling, as if trying to hold onto anything that might stop their fall, eg their mother. Think of it as survival instinct back from when we where monkeys,or at least that's the predominant theory. Ever seen a baby chimpanzee holding onto its mother's fur? The warning sensation starts in your stomach, and it is simply your brain letting you know you will get hurt unless you find some stable &quot;ground&quot;. You start producing adrenaline to help you trigger the &quot;fight or flight&quot; response, in this case fight. Adrenaline is known to stimulate the digesting system, which may be why you feel it in your throat and stomach first.</p>
<p>Ever seen cats fighting? Often they shit themselves during a fight because their brains want to focus blood flow on their limbs and muscles instead of digestion, so they can have as much stamina as their bodies allow and escape danger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
