		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whales &amp; dolphins evolved from land animals; they adapted their existing lungs to living in the water and that was good enough to allow them to survive with out evolving back to gills.</p>
<p>The fact that sharks &amp; whales both exist show that neither gills nor lungs is strongly preferred for survival; lungs provide far more oxygen and allow whales &amp; dolphins to sustain their warm-blooded metabolism and speed, gills don't provide enough for that but do allow continued submergence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At one point many millions of years ago, a land animal thought: &quot;I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle.&quot; And decided to piss off to the ocean. Over the generations, he slowly got better at swimming, and his breathing tubes moved. Got fat, too.</p>
<p>He never evolved gills because he was just fine without them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>About 55 million years ago a certain land mammal, very similar to a hippopotamus, began to make a living near and in the ocean. Over time, a period of about 5 million years, this species diverged and diverged again, evolving into a multitude of semi-aquatic mammals adept at swimming and making a living in the ocean. Fast forward another 10 million years and these species had diverged even further, evolving rudimentary flippers and fins. In total, over a period of 35 - 45 million years these hippopotamus-like mammals, who carved a niche out in ocean foraging, led to the evolution of modern whales that we know today. And that's why aquatic mammals breathe air, because they were once land mammals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It may seem strange but lungs are actually far better than gills for sea creatures. Compared to gills lungs provide a huge amount of oxygen which makes animals with them significantly stronger, in addition to this as lungs are filled periodically at the surface rather than continually like gills so they are significantly harder to clog which provides a wider range of pray.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whales and dolphins are mammals, not fish. Their ancestors were land-dwelling mammals that eventually adapted to life at sea.</p>
<p>The fact that whales and dolphins look so similar to fish is an example of convergent evolution - basically organisms with very different ancestry evolving similar morphology, in this case fins and hydrodynamic bodies, for the same environment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
