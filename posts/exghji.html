		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You might be familiar with how the Nile River in Egypt works from school.  If you aren't - for 9 months out of the year the Nile has a moderate flow rate that is sufficient to support human settlement and agriculture.  For the remaining 3 months the Nile's flow rate increases dramatically and it floods a huge area around its river banks.</p>
<p>That flooding might sound bad but its not.  Using soil for agricultural purposes will deplete it's minerals within about 100 years.  That's a long time compared to a human life, but not compared to a civilization.  When the soil runs out of minerals you can't grow anything in it anymore, and it turns out that this is the limiting factor for most civilizations.  IE, a civilization will begin intensively farming its soil, deplete the soil, then starve to death.</p>
<p>In the modern world we're able to replenish the soil's minerals with fertilizer.  They were sort of able to do this in the ancient world as well, but this involved transporting huge amounts of animal manure which is difficult to do and, in practice, if an ancient civilization had to manually fertilize the soil it would result in very low agricultural yields.</p>
<p>This is what makes the Nile's floods so good for the development of civilization - every time the Nile would flood it deposits a huge amount of new soil in the areas that got flooded.  The source of that new soil was hills and mountains in Central Africa, so it was filled with minerals.  Or to put it another way - every year the Nile naturally dumped a huge amount of fertilizer on Egypt.  </p>
<p>This natural fertilizing allowed Egypt to be by far the most productive agricultural region West of India for thousands of years - everyone from the Pharaohs to Alexander the Great to the Roman Empire fed themselves using the food that the Nile was able to grow.</p>
<p>How does this relate to China?  The Yellow River in China is the same type of river as the Nile.  It spends most of the year with a moderate flow rate, then has massive floods for a few months that deposit a bunch of new soil along its banks.</p>
<p>Where the Yellow River is different from the Nile is in its size.  The Nile is a single, small river with practically no tributaries or lakes.  The Nile's floods only cover a small geographic area located immediately adjacent to it.</p>
<p>The Yellow River, on the other hand, is a massive system with hundreds of tributaries and lakes.  When it floods, it covers almost the entirety of South East China - which is an area thousands of times the size of that covered by the Nile.  </p>
<p>The Yellow River basin has been among for the most productive agricultural areas on Earth for much of human history.  Because the only limiting factor to population size is a region's ability to produce food, this also means that the Yellow River Basin (and by extension, China) has managed to maintain a huge population for the entirety of human history.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From my understanding, it was due to location. The Yangzi River provided very fertile soil. On top of that, there was a unique type of food in the region.</p>
<p>To understand this, there is an important concept that is required. Food is required to support a population. A population will grow till it reaches an equilibrium with the available food sources. If there is food to spare, the population will grow. If you take a look at the <a href="http://cdn3.chartsbin.com/chartimages/l_28k_fb27f87c424b999a77661bdcc504d973" target="_blank">population of the UK over time</a>, you can see when the industrial revolution started.</p>
<p>Back to the unique food in the Yangzi river valley, that is Rice. From my understanding, for a given acre of farmland, Rice can provide around ~10-11 million calories per year. While an acre of wheat can only provide ~5-6 million calories per year. From this alone you can see that the Yangzi river valley can support a huge population.</p>
<p>Edit: Mixed up my rivers. Meant the Yangzi river, not the Yellow River. Also changed the wheat caloric output from 1 million per year to 5-6 million per year since I had that value wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not only did the Chinese have one of the most fertile rivers in the world along with a tributary network rivaling the Mississippi River but they were <em>really</em> into organization and public works. Organized networks of canals, mills, terraces and other vital infrastructure like no where else at the time. Massive legions if government officials also kept track of yield and distributions to make sure the population was fed. China also had rice, which has an extremely good yield along with a ton if land to grow it on.</p>
<p>That said it wasnt fool proof. China declined and collapsed several times over, they just never had a big enough foreign invader to supplant them and wipe out their general way of life. If anything foreign invaders just went with it and found the Chinese systems superior like with the Mongol Yuan dynasty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not an apt comparison.  In terms of geographical size and and the variety of regions and cultures, it's better to compare ancient China with the whole Mediterranean region and Mesopotamia.  The region now covered by China has had multiple empires, often competing empires, just like Western civilization.  China now has over 200 living languages, and probably a similar number of cultures.  So of course the &quot;Chinese&quot; (not really Chinese) thrived a long time.  There was always someone nearby to carry on the torch. The same thing happened in the West, but the whole region of early western civilization isn't covered by a single country, hence the confusion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not just China, but India also.</p>
<p>There are probably a dozen factors that contribute to the long term large and sustained human populations of those regions, but if I had to pick ONE and only one, I would pick a reliable water supply. The headwaters of the Ganges, Indus, Brahmaputra, Yellow, and Yangtze rivers are all fed by melt water from the Himalayan snow pack. The Himalayan snow pack is built up every year by the seasonal Indian Monsoon Current and that snow pack is MASSIVE. If the monsoon fails or is weak one year, or even several years in row, there is still enough snow pack from previous years' monsoons to provide plenty of water for drinking, irrigation, and navigation along those five rivers.</p>
<p>With a large and reliable source of fresh water for drinking and irrigation you can sustain large populations. These large rivers also provide a means of navigation so trade and communication are easier. This makes it easier to organize a civilization with a centralized(ish) government, making it easier to create a larger, more homogenized(ish) society and culture.</p>
<p>In contrast, the rivers of the Fertile Crescent, the Tigris, Euphrates, and Nile are all fed almost exclusively by direct rainfall. Annual melt water from snow pack is almost non-existent for those rivers, so they have no buffer if seasonal rains are abnormally low or if there is a drought.</p>
