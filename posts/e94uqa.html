Would if be an effective weapon? Would it heat up to the atmosphere too much? Would it bend space-time to a noticeable state? How much of a destructive force would it cause on impact? Is it even possible in theory, if enough energy could be harnessed?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends a great deal on what exactly you mean by &quot;near the speed of light&quot; and what exactly you're launching. It depends somewhat on the launch angle too.</p>
<p>The energy and momentum of an object can be calculated using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_factor" target="_blank">lorentz factor</a>. Total energy is given simply by the rest mass times the lorentz factor. From this kinetic energy can be found by subtracting the rest mass. Momentum can be found by multiplying the velocity, the rest mass and the lorentz factor. This is the same way you normally calculate momentum but adjusted to use the relativistic mass instead of the rest mass.</p>
<p>When you increase the velocity of an object its lorentz factor changes. At low speed this change is very small. At high speed this change is very big. Here are some lorentz factors to compare. (rounded to the nearest 3rd decimal)</p>
<p>00.00% light speed =  1.000 lorentz factor (lorentz factor is 1 at rest)<br />
50.00% light speed =  1.155 lorentz factor<br />
90.00% light speed =  2.294 lorentz factor<br />
99.00% light speed =  7.089 lorentz factor<br />
99.90% light speed = 22.366 lorentz factor<br />
99.99% light speed = 70.712 lorentz factor</p>
<p>An object traveling at 90% the speed of light has 30 times less total energy, 58 times less kinetic energy and 34 times less momentum than an object traveling at 99.99% the speed of light.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Let's consider a specific example. You specify &quot;the size and weight of an airsoft ball or a sand of grain&quot; so I'll use an example that's in the middle and uses round easy numbers. A 1 mm metal cube with a density of 10 g/cm\^3 (this is between the desnity of steel and lead). To minimize air resistance the projectile will be shot straight up. This projectile will be shot at 99% the speed of light.</p>
<p>The amount of air the projectile will run into is almost exactly equivalent to its cross sectional area times the atmospheric pressure divided by the strength of gravity. This is because the pressure of the atmosphere comes directly from its weight, and this projectile is moving fast enough that it won't encounter much that isn't already directly in front of it. A 1 mm cube has a cross sectional area of 1 mm\^2. Atmospheric pressure is about 100,000 n/m\^2. Gravity on earth is about 9.8 m/s\^2, but we'll just use 10 for simplicity. The projectile will encounter about 10 grams of air on its way through the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The projectile itself weighs exactly 10 milligrams. Momentum is conserved so we can estimate its new velocity after encountering all this air by using our previous momentum equation. The rest mass has increased by a factor of 1001 times. The projectile is launched with a momentum of 10 milligrams * 0.99 * speed of light * 7.089(lorentz) = 21,039.8 kg m/s. From this we can calculate the new lorentz factor times the new velocity is 2,101,874.6 m/s. The lorentz factor is slightly higher than 1 making the velocity slightly lower than 2,101,874.6 m/s which is 0.701% light speed. From this we can calculate the lorentz factor is less than 1.00002458, which is basically 1.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>A lot of people are saying there would be nuclear fusion reactions at the leading edge of the projectile. This is largely inaccurate. There would be fusion reactions occurring, but more importantly there would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spallation" target="_blank">spallation</a> at the leading edge. Most, or at least a significant fraction of the material resulting from the nuclear interactions will be alpha particles, protons and neutrons.</p>
<p>Due to the incredible temperature produced by the interaction with the air there will be incredibly bright x-ray <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation" target="_blank">black body</a> radiation. Almost all of the kinetic energy will be converted to x-rays in this way. Almost all of this will happen in the first few kilometers of its flight.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The net result is that there will be a sizable, but not incredible reaction force as the projectile is pushed by the launcher off of earth. Then there will immediately be a flash of x-rays produced in a beam in the path of the projectile. This flash will be accompanied by a significantly weaker, but still incredibly strong flash of neutrons. Then the projectile and almost all of the air in from of it will escape earth and then the sun and then the galaxy and fly off into intergalactic space.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It should be noted that this is just one example. If you launched a smaller projectile slower and at a shallower angle it would slow down enough to stop having nuclear interactions with the air and possibly even enough that it would not escape the atmosphere. If you launched a larger projectile faster it would have a much larger kinetic energy and reaction force on the ground. An adequately large and fast projectile will create a black hole due to its energy density. However in the real world the black hole would necessarily form before the projectile is launched because it will form as soon as the energy is all in a small enough place. Similarly a projectile that is nearly large enough to make a black hole will have an enormous gravitational impact on earth, but that gravitational impact will be present before the projectile is launched. </p>

<p>There is a lot more that should be said about this, but I'm getting a bit tired of typing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As the projectile ploughs through the atmosphere, it would build up a dense front of air particles on the &quot;front&quot; edge. This would quickly become so hot and dense that it would start to undergo nuclear fusion. Basically, within a fraction of a second, you get a thermonuclear explosion, destroying the projectile and the nearby area.</p>
<p>In terms of energy, accelerating a 1g projectile to 90% of the speed of light takes about 30 Gigawatt-hours. The biggest nuclear power plants in the world produce several gigawatts of power. So this is about the equivalent of the biggest nuclear power plant in the world running for a few hours. The practical problem is how you'd convert all that into the kinetic energy of a single particle without melting or blowing up your equipment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the xkcd answer is awesome - another way to think about it is that particle accelerators already do this with single particles.  Those particles hit some particle target and you get nuclear interactions.  Like the tiniest possible nuclear explosion.  The more particles you have, i.e. the more mass, the larger your explosion gets.  The maximum energy you could get out of a grain of sand is calculated by E=mc^2.  You won't get a 100% efficient conversion of mass to energy, but even a fraction of that energy will be large:<br />
grain of sand : .000004g  or 4e-6 kg<br />
c :     3e8 m/s  </p>
<p>mc^2 = 4e-6 * 9e16<br />
= 36e10 J or 3.6e11 J  </p>
<p>A ton of TNT is about 4.2e9 J so we're looking at the equivalent of about 85 tons of TNT.  That's the upper limit, you'll end up with some fraction of that.  I started googling how much TNT it takes to demo a stadium and then realized that will probably get me on a list...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
