		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both kinda. There are veins in roughly the same spots in everyone but they are also slightly different and different veins are more pronounced in different people. With arteries more than veins, but somewhat with veins. this is why it's important to check the functionality of other vessels in the area before procedures etc to make sure blood is still able to circulate if a vein is taken for a graft or an artery is occluded temporarily</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Developmental vascular biologist here... veins are INCREDIBLY variable from individual to individual. There are humans with entire cerebral veins missing and compensatory hyper/hypoplasticity of a single side. They really grow where there are specific ligands signaling angiogenesis and where there is flow dependent uptake of interstitial fluid. So, depending on the individual, the venous make up can vary greatly. Arteries on the other hand are a little more stable and consistent</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In general, the vascular system is the same in the gross. In the fine, they can be variable and the variability/ ease of detecting variability varies depending on where you look.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of an interesting story I read about once.</p>
<p>A woman was working in a factory, and her hair was caught in a machine. It ripped her scalp off. Horrifying, of course, but not immediately life-threatening. But her co-workers were smart; while they were waiting for the ambulance, they took her scalp and put it on ice. This allowed a surgeon to reattach it later.</p>
<p>Now, there are thousands and thousands of little blood vessels in that patch of skin, and it would have been impossible to reattach all of them. But the surgeon didn't need to do that. He just needed to reconnect a few main blood vessels, allowing blood to flow into the area and be distributed to all of the smaller vessels. This allowed the skin to remain alive, and the natural healing process gradually reconnected everything else, including the blood vessels and nerves.</p>
<p>But there was one weird side effect. While the nerves all reconnected, they didn't connect exactly the way they were before. Which meant that the signals going to her brain were different now. So if she touched one part of her scalp, she felt the touch in a completely different part, because her brain thought it was receiving the signal from a different area.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
