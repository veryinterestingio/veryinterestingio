It's like looking at a distant mountain, or any object on the horizon, when you're in a car. It's far enough that it looks almost stationary. Compare it to the nearby objects that seem to zoom past, even though your speed doesn't change.
Also, you often have to adjust the telescope every few mins, to account for the earth's rotation, but that can be done automatically using modern hi-tech telescopes</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially, it's the rate that the angle of view changes that matters, not the speed of the object. Whether it's far away and moving quickly or close to and moving slowly, the angular change is the same.</p>
<p>When photographing moving objects, it is also possible to &quot;pan&quot; the camera, change the angle of view to follow the object. That technique is more often used for terrestrial photography like racing cars. But a reverse of that idea is used for terrestrial astronomy where the telescope mount moves over time to counter the rotation of the Earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>Distance. The planets are very far away, so they don't seem to be moving much from here.</li>
<li>Equatorial telescope mounts. These compensate for the earth's rotation, helping to keep the telescope locked onto a distant object, like a planet, and allow a long esposure without blur. Most of the movement we can see from the earth's surface is from the Earth's rotation (once a day), not the movement of Earth and the other planet around the sun (once a year - much less change in an hour or so). </li>
<li>Image stacking. Many photos of planets and other celestial objects are actually stacks of images. Many photos are taken, then special software is used to stack the images together, keeping only pixals that all of the seperate images have in common. Photoshop will do this, but there are other tools that are targeted just for Astral photography. This helps eliminate blurring from movement, fringing from the telescope optics, and other undesirable artifacts by averaging them out. </li>
