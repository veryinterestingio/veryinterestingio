The ootheca is secreted by two glands, one  of which  secretes a protein, and  the other an ortho- dihydroxyphenol.  The  phenol  is  oxidized to  the corresponding  quinone, which  reacts  with  the  basic  groups  of the  protein  in such  a way  as  to introduce primary valence cross-linkages between the protein chains, and so very greatly to increase the stability of the protein.  For this type of “tanned protein” the name sclerotin was proposed.</a>&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I mean, the new cuticle is pretty well prepared. It's not like an insect starts building the cuticle from scratch after moulting the old cuticle.</p>
<p>What happens is moulting fluid is injected underneath the old exoskeleton, kinda like a blister in our skin (except the layer above is rigid). Then a new cuticle starts to grow underneath that, and when it's ready the moulting fluid is activated and digests the lower parts of the old cuticle until it's weak enough for the insect to escape it. Then the prepared new cuticle just has to set. This involves chemical crosslinking of the proteins that accompany the chitin in the exoskeleton.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>tl,dr; they make chemicals, puff themselves up while squishy, then release another chemical to harden.</p>
<p>To summarize from Gullan &amp; Cranston 'The Insects: An outline of Entomology' (1996):</p>
<p>The process and control of moulting 6.3</p>
<p>The new stage comes into existence at the time of apolysis, when the epidermis separates from the cuticle of the previous stage.   ...many insects spend a substantial period in the pharate state, awaiting conditions (or time for cicadas) favorable for the emergence as the next stage.</p>
<p>Moulting is a complex process involving hormonal, behavioural, epidermal and cuticular changes that lead up to the shedding of the old cuticle..... the moult commences with the retraction of the epidermal cells from the inner surface of the old cuticle. </p>
<p>Ecdysis commences with the remnants of the old cuticle splitting along the dorsal midline (middle of the back longways) due to increase in haemolymph (blood) pressure.  The cast cuticle (exuviae or old shell) consists of indigestible protein, lipid and chitin of the old epicuticle and exocutile.  </p>
<p>Once free of the constraints of this previous 'skin', the newly ecdysed insects expands the new cuticle by swallowing air or water and/or by inscreasing haemolymph pressure in different body parts to smooth out the wrinkled and folded epicuticle and stretch the procuticle.  </p>
<p>After cuticular expansion, some or much of the body surface may become sclerotized (hardened) by the chemical stiffening and darkening of the procuticle to form the exocuticle.</p>
<p>Moulting and metamorphosis are controlled by three major types of hormones:</p>
<p>*Neuropeptides prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) and eclosion hormone EH</p>
<p>*Ecdysteroids</p>
<p>*Juvenile Hormone JH, which may occur in several different forms even in the same insect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
