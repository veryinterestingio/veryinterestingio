		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We were two of the lead negotiators of the Paris Climate Agreement, and continue to dedicate our careers and lives to stopping the climate crisis -- Christiana was Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 2010-2016 and Tom was a senior member of the UN team that created the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, signed by 195 countries in 2015. AUA! </p>
<p><strong> We are at a critical decision making moment that will determine the entire future of humanity.</strong> This year and the next ten are going to have more of an impact on the future of the Earth than any other decade in history. We are facing either a world of breakdown and conflict, of floods and disasters that will be close to home more quickly than we could have imagined, where hope has slipped away - OR - a world that is renewed, where forests have regrown and cities are remade, where your children are not afraid to have children of their own. That reality is overwhelming for most of us because we don't know what to do about it. </p>
<p>While we do not deny that daunting challenges are ahead, we do not agree with the idea that we are somehow already doomed to a devastating future or that humanity is somehow flawed and incapable of responding to big problems; we are fully convinced that we can avert the worst of the climate crisis through a change of mindset and the ten actions outlined in our book. </p>
<p>We are really excited to be here today to answer all of your questions around climate change and creating together the world that we all hope to see -- and live in! We will be here at 4:30pm ET today, so ask us anything and let's talk about how to wade through all of the existing news and information about climate issues, and really distill it all down so we can each create our own action plans to collectively survive the climate crisis. </p>
<p>You can see more on our book at <a href="https://globaloptimism.com" target="_blank">https://globaloptimism.com</a> and also connect with us further on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/CFigueres" target="_blank">@cfigueres</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/tomcarnac" target="_blank">@tomcarnac</a>. We also host a podcast called <a href="https://globaloptimism.com/podcast/" target="_blank">Outrage &amp; Optimism</a> where we interview journalists and global leaders on how to drive social and environmental change. </p>
<hr />
<p>Again, our guests will be here at 4:30pm ET (21:30 UT).</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why is the UNFCCC's Common Reporting Format, or CRF as we used to call it, so poorly developed? I worked in the field of climate change for 2 years as a scientist tasked with the annual reporting of GHG emissions to the EU and UNFCCC from the transport sector in my country. I'm sorry but the portal is absolutely attrocious and buggy. This tool is an essential component of GHG emissions reporting for every country in the world, its efficacy and stability is imperative imo.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
