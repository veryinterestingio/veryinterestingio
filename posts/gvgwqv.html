This is leading to a massive spike in depression and related symptoms. For these reasons, I was wondering if someone could give me a good explanation for why resting often makes exhausting situations even more exhausting. Thanks!</p></div></div>

And  I remember someone said when you make exercise regularly, body thinks like I burnt a lot of ATP so I need to produce a lot more and thats why we feel more energetic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you exercise, you need more energy. As a result, your body gears up to provide you with everything you need. You start burning more fuel to release more energy. You start breathing deeper to supply more oxygen to every part of your body.</p>
<p>And vice versa the same happens. If you behave like a couch potato, your body is going to gear down. Most of the food you ingest will be shunted to storage rather than burned up for energy. You breathe easy, your heart rate goes down.</p>
<p>Your question is kinda like asking why a car can drive farther when you hit the gas compared to turning of the engine while you coast.</p>
<p>On top of that, your body isn't simply a vehicle for your mind. It's much more accurate to say your mind is an operating system to get your body where it needs to go. Any time you only use your body while your mind languishes or vice versa, you're not doing your physical and mental health any favours.</p>
<p>You evolved to live in the moment when body and mind working in perfect synchronicity towards a single goal. That's why exercise is good for our mental health.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think about it like percentages. If you have 100 energy and spend 90 of that on daily things you have 10% left. </p>
<p>Increasing strength makes tasks easier so you might only use up 80 per day. Increasing cardio makes starting energy higher, say 120. Now you have 33% left at the end of the day.</p>
<p>You mention mood so I'll add that exercise is a positive feedback loop. It makes you feel better and more energetic so it's easier to get more exercise so you feel better and more energetic... works the same way in reverse for laziness.</p>
<p>In a sentence, exhaustion is relative to how much energy you have.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Long term - because we are a very adaptable animal and we will adapt to low energy situations as well as high energy ones. So in low energy situations we will lose mitochondria (the power plant of the cell) because they arenâ€™t worth the resources to create them. In high energy situations we create them. Active people who enjoy exercise will have more mitochondria and other physiological differences like fat adaptation that allow for sustained higher energy levels.</p>
<p>Short term - because exercise releases endorphins and other biochemicals that increase energy. Adrenaline for example is a hormone that is also used in the brain as a neurotransmitter. In the body it increases energy use, in the brain it increases the sympathetic nervous system and increases heart rate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
