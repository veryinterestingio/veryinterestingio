		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/Astrokiwi covered the orbital mechanics side of this question, but it's worth thinking about what meteors coming in from different directions look like to a viewer on the ground.</p>
<p>Here's a long-duration, whole-sky photo of a meteor shower: </p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Geminid%C3%A1k_meteorraj_maximuma_2007-ben.jpg" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Geminid%C3%A1k_meteorraj_maximuma_2007-ben.jpg</a></p>
<p>The center of the photo is straight up; the horizon is on the edges.  This photo was taken at a time and place where the meteors were indeed coming in almost perpendicular to the Earth's surface (about 75 degrees angle, actually).  All the meteors are coming in on parallel tracks, but because of perspective they appear to be radiating out from a single point near the center of the picture.  It's a bit like how parallel railroad tracks seem to meet at a vanishing point, or seeing snowflakes as you drive through a snowstorm.</p>
<p>The meteors that are coming directly toward the observer appear as very short streaks near the center of this image.  To the eye, they look like a sudden stationary flash of light in the sky, or a brief slow-moving dot.  They're directly overhead, where people tend not to look, and they're not very noticeable anyway.  The much more obvious streaks closer to the horizon are caused by meteors that are also coming almost straight down perpendicular to the surface of the Earth, but are aimed at a spot maybe 100 km away from the observer.</p>
<p>And there's one last factor to consider: meteors that come straight down into the atmosphere reach the thick parts of the atmosphere very quickly, and burn up in just a second or two.  Meteors that come in at a glancing angle spend more time in the upper atmosphere and take longer to burn up -- long enough for someone to notice, pull out their cell phone and take a video.</p>
<p>The upshot: meteors do come in perpendicular to the Earth's surface, but:
1) the ones that come in directly over the observer are hard to notice
2) the ones that <em>don't</em> come in directly over the observer don't look like you'd expect
3) the ones that come in at a glancing angle last longer, and so are much easier to notice and photograph.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>none, just a matter of likelihood. Having a completely perpendicular trajectory to the surface of something wobbling through space at a great rate is totally plausible, just a lot less probable than having a trajectory that happens to wander into a path that intersects with our atmosphere at any random angle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
