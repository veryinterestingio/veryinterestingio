Was it the terrain that made it difficult ?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The immediate cause of World War 2 was Hitler's desire to dominate the European continent.</p>
<p>However, domination doesn't necessarily require an invasion. Switzerland allowed the Nazis to continue banking with them throughout the war, and Swiss factories produced some vital military components for them too. Given that the Swiss were willing to freely offer that much cooperation, additional gains from invading and occupying Switzerland would not have been worth the cost.</p>
<p>Hitler wanted a similar arrangement with the United Kingdom, but the Brits were completely opposed to a German-dominated Continent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>France</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Germans wanted French territory lost after WW1, which the French were unwilling to give up, and the French were historical enemies of Germany. The people of France would not have accepted neutrality and even if they had, the Germans never would have trusted a neutral France at their backs to stay neutral.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Poland</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of Hitler's war aims was to depopulate Eastern Europe and repopulate it with German settlers. Again, this is something the Polish people never could have rolled over and accepted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Czechoslovakia</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ditto Czechoslovakia</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Switzerland is a <em>bitch</em> to invade.  Mountainous terrain is incredibly difficult to traverse, especially when under fire.  There are only a few mountain passes that would allow an invasion, and Switzerland defends those heavily, to the point that today they could detonate a few explosive charges and seal off the entire country.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have ridden my bike through Switzerland, predominantly in the south of the country. As everyone says it is mountainous and inhospitable. More than just large mountains, all of the mountain pass roads are essential single lane and they all have stretches through large ravines. The roads are cut into a mountain side with a 200m drop to a river/the ground. Literally every pass I have ridden has stretches like this, and usually has a few on each pass. This is what finally clicked with me about why it would be so hard to invade. You would only have to defend/destroy a few short sections of the mountain roads across the country and there would be no way to march into the country. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone uses the word &quot;neutral&quot; but the more appropriate word is probably &quot;independent&quot;. They weren't really neutral in WW2. The Swiss National Museum in Zurich has a great history of Switzerland exhibit, and it is fairly self-critical of the WW2 period. The sense you get is they did just enough to keep the Nazis happy enough to not invade. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Switzerland is like a porcupine.</p>
<p>A porcupine is a docile herbivore, but if you have a go at one, the quills come out. Without quills, a porcupine is just a groundhog that could be eaten by predators, but with quills it is left alone.</p>
<p>This is to say that Switzerland has always taken its military seriously despite having no intention of using them. For centuries, they have understood that neutrality is meaningless without deterrence. </p>
<p>Second, what if the porcupine was also a banker who helped elites from all sides hide and protect their wealth? You've heard of &quot;Swiss bank accounts&quot;...that's because Switzerland used its neutrality to bulk up on financial services catering to the very people who can influence wars.</p>
<p>And yes, the terrain helps too. It's good for hiding camouflaged bunkers and such, and for funnelling the incoming enemy.</p>
<p>Edit to add:
Bigger European countries haven't been docile herbivores. They've gone far and wide to expand their spheres of influence, and created conflicts along the way. The smaller ones that didn't start any problems also didn't have strong militaries to protect themselves. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
