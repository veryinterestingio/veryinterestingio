		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, people often experience a wide range of symptoms (from no symptoms to very severe) for most illnesses including the flu, cold or Coronavirus, depending on a variety of factors including age, sex, genetics, immune health and regulation and many other reasons we don’t yet understand. </p>
<p>Below I’ve pasted a link for a meta-analysis that reviewed papers trying to estimate how many people with flu infections are asymptomatic. The interesting thing is that while it is clear there are a sizable number of people that are asymptomatic it is difficult to quantify this number because depending on how you test for the illness and who you test and what strain of flu etc these numbers can change. They had a wide range of estimates, but based on one testing method for infection they had an estimate of about 15% of those tested were asymptomatic whereas using other methods they had an estimate closer to 70% of people were asymptomatic. So I think it’s clear that people can be asymptomatic, but the exact numbers of how many people are a asymptomatic and to what type of illness will vary widely. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Any infection for any pathogen does not guarantee the expression of symptoms in general let alone specific symptoms.  It is the combination of context, presentation and physicality that may indicate a type of infection and nature of progression.</p>
<p>Remember, being sick means your immune system has been overwhelmed.  It doesn’t stop working when you’re healthy/well — quite the opposite.  Being alive means being exposed to microbiota 24/7, 365 for life.</p>
<p>For example, if the physicality of an infection is limited to your nasal passage only, the immune response still occurs.  As you would expect, progression of symptoms may present with varied severity compared to a full infection of epithelial lung tissue, even with the same disease.   Other combinations of factors may play a role as well, such as age, cardiovascular conditioning, metabolism, genetic factors, prior exposure/residual antibodies, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

For example, some are immune to HIV/AIDs Or those with sickle cell disease being intrinsically resistant to malaria. That's one of the neat parts of genetics</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
