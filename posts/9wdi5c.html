But I am getting confused by the claims of the contractive states breaking the limit, and yet a reinterpretation of definitions of precision and resolution seems to validate that <em>repetitive</em> measurements can <em>never be broken</em> due to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Relation between the Standard Deviations of the positions of the free mass at the first and the second measurements, which equals to the SQL. But the review paper I read itself said, after pointing the the HUP=SQL, that the SQL is not a fundamental limit. How?</p>
<p>Does the Uncertainty relation mean that the SQL can never be broken? Shouldn't it? Does it mean no one's working on breaking it? All the above paragraph was from papers from before 2000s, so what's the consensus now?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to answer without more context or without knowing the papers you're actually reading, but maybe it's <em>squeezing</em>?</p>
<p>The Heisenberg inequality is typically the product of the variances of two conjugated variables or quadratures, e.g. ΔX²ΔY²≥ħ²/4. Naively, one would assume that ΔX²≥ħ/2 and ΔY²≥ħ/2 in this case. </p>
<p>However, it's possible that one of the variance is smaller than that <em>naive</em> limit, as long as the other is greater, e.g.  ΔX²=ħ/4 and ΔY²=ħ. In this case, we say that X is <em>squeezed</em> (because ΔX²&lt;ħ/2); i.e. that it <em>appears</em> to beat the quantum limit. In reality, no real limit is violated because ΔX²ΔY²≥ħ²/4 holds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A partial answer:</p>
<p>The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is a statistical relation between incompatible operators.  It will never be violated, ever, because it‘s trivially true.  (It can be proven from pure mathematics with only the definition of variance + the Schwartz inequality.)</p>
<p>A contractive state is a special state whose position’s variance decreases for a time.  However, σ_x <em> σ_p &gt; ħ/2 for all contractive states, always.  In fact, a contractive state’s σ_x </em> σ_p approaches ħ/2 in the limit the state approaches the usual minimum-uncertainty wave packet.</p>
<p>The “standard quantum limit” in that context is just the x-uncertainty of a wave packet (i.e. not the exact same thing as the uncertainty principle).  The “standard quantum limit” elsewhere can differ, and can refer more to the state’s preparation and a particular observable.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any follow-up questions or clarifications.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>SQL discussions can be tricky in part because different fields have adopted different definitions of the SQL. Here are some more recent papers that I found useful in studying the quantum limits to measurement, which may or may not be useful to you.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.7.021008" target="_blank"><a href="https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.7.021008" target="_blank">https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.7.021008</a></a>  This is an experimental paper, but it has a detailed description of some of the different quantum limits people talk about. I think the description is general enough to apply to the free mass limit (take the mechanical resonance frequency to zero)</li>
<li><a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/10/9/095010/meta" target="_blank"><a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/10/9/095010/meta" target="_blank">http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/10/9/095010/meta</a></a> This one proposes a scheme for avoiding the measurement backaction by measuring &quot;stroboscopically.&quot; That might be similar to what you're talking about regarding &quot;repetitive&quot; measurement, although they're not in the free mass limit again. This scheme has also been tested experimentally, but for technical reasons, it hasn't beaten the SQL yet. Here are some experiments:
<ul>
<li>Suh, Weinstein, et al, Science 2014</li>
<li>Lecocq, Clark, et al, PRX 2015</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Also check out &quot;Introduction to quantum noise, measurement, and amplification,&quot; in Reviews of Modern Physics from 2010. Lot's of general information, and they do discuss the SQL.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, yes. &quot;Contractive states&quot; isn't language I'm familiar with but you can certainly achieve higher precision measurements without violating the HUP. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you define the standard quantum limit to be the same as the shot noise limit i.e. what you can achieve with classical resources then you can beat this. This is an excellent paper on the Heisenberg limit as the fundamental limit in metrology,  &quot;General optimality of the Heisenberg limit for quantum metrology&quot; - <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.3944.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.3944.pdf" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.3944.pdf</a></a>.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This paper is very involved but is a nice demonstration of phase estimation well beyond the SQL, &quot; Experimental optical phase measurement at the exact Heisenberg limit &quot; - <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.06630.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.06630.pdf" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.06630.pdf</a></a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
