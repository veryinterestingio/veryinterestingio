<p>Long story short, people can't actually tell when someone is looking at them unless they have seen that person looking at them.  Your eyes pick up a lot of information and not all of it goes into your immediate awareness.  We have super sensitivity to gaze and even a glimpse of someone or something looking at you can trigger it.  On the rare occasion that you do catch it, you are more likely to remember that than every time you don't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Answer: This phenomenon can be explained using the theories of selective attention. Our brain is bombarded with sensory input and the brain can only send a tiny fraction of it to your conscious to keep things coherent. Like in a computer there are so many tasks running in the background but if all of it were displayed/brought to your attention it would not make sense.<br />
The sensory input received from the eye is greater than what our conscious brain sees. Selective attention lets us focus on what we need and discard any excess information unless you consciously bring your attention to that information. Example: you are probably so focused reading this that you are discarding the rest of the information being picked up by your eyes. If you however notice some movement in your peripheral vision or consciously bring your attention to what's happening outside of your phone/computer screen without moving your eyes away from the screen, you will notice new information pour into your conscience.<br />
So, that feeling that someone is staring at you may be information that you eyes sent to your brain but which you didn't notice till you drew your attention over it.             </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your peripheral vision tracks motion and it sees/calculates when that unfocused motion is tracking your motion, a head or eyes track your motion, following you; you're being watched, that rock is falling right toward you, a predator is stalking you. It is so different from your primary, central vision that it is a different sense; you &quot;feel&quot; like you're being watched.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some people believe in a sixth sense called &quot;Proximity sense&quot; but this feeling you speak of is probably a combination of other senses, like the auditory cues other people have mentioned, or peripheral vision. Proximity sense was the &quot;superpower&quot; of assassin Nicolai Hel in Trevanian's &quot;Shibumi&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you talk about sensations where it is still in our field of vision, but not our focus, I think we always and very sensitive recognize position of objects around us.
You would also recognize if a door would just move slightly or there is a whistle behind you. It may reach your consciousness or not. </p>
<p>There are certain body positions that give away that someone is looking in our direction.
That doesn't mean they are doing this, but it gets possible and we want to check it. </p>
<p>Same goes for sensations that are out of our field if vision. Then other senses like hearing sense step in. </p>
<p>I do not believe in any 'realisation' of staring without involvement of our usual senses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
