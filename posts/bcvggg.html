<p>Edit: Damn, I watched the hockey game and came back to reddit and saw this blew up. The conclusion seems to be no one really knows exactly if salt is good or bad for your body. If I'm already hypertensive, it might be a good idea to avoid too much sodium just in case.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>lots of posts about the effect of salt on the body. in general, the effect of a high-salt diet depends on whether you have health problems. it's important to know that salt concentration (osmolarity) and water volume (blood pressure) are regulated separately by the body. source: I'm a doctor. all those years of med school have finally led me to this moment!</p>
<p>for people who are healthy, salt intake doesn't have much of an effect, since the kidneys work well to balance salt and water.</p>
<p>if you have high blood pressure, high salt intake is a problem because it increases blood pressure. this is because your body is very sensitive to your blood's osmolarity, and so more salt in your blood will make it retain more water. more water in blood = high blood pressure. your kidneys will eventually filter the salt into your pee, but by then you'll have eaten more salt, and the cycle continues. a major reason people without high blood pressure don't have this problem is that their blood vessels are more flexible, and so they're able to accommodate the higher volume more easily, which normalizes the blood pressure (your blood vessels have muscles around them that widen or narrow up your blood vessels). what makes the blood vessels less flexible? well, age is a factor (age makes connective tissue less flexible, which is part of why older people have wrinkles). genetics is another factor. another major factor is cholesterol build-up in the blood vessels (so-called atherosclerosis), which makes the inside of the blood vessels more narrow (which itself increases blood pressure), and also 'hardens' the blood vessels to prevent them from widening.</p>
<p>if you have kidney problems, high salt intake is a problem too. I said earlier that your kidneys will eventually filter the salt in your pee. if your kidneys aren't great, then they have a hard time filtering things, and that also causes high blood pressure. for people with kidney problem salt <em>balance</em> is also affected. the amount of Na, K, and Cl ions in the blood is very tightly regulated through a series of ion exchangers in the kidney, which trade some ions for other ions. people with kidney problems can have major ion imbalances, which can be bad. Na in particular has effects on the brain, and K has effects on the heart. high doses of a particular ion (i.e. high salt intake is only Na &amp; Cl) can drive these imbalances.</p>
<p>if you have heart failure, high salt intake is a problem, again because it causes the body (i.e. the kidneys) to retain water. the high salt concentration doesn't directly injure or affect the heart, but the excess volume is a problem for people with heart failure. heart failure means that your heart doesn't pump as efficiently as the rest of the body needs it to. this causes all sorts of problems, but one of the major ones is that fluid backs up in the system. the blood vessels can only take so much fluid (they can only widen up so far), and so the rest of the extra fluid has to sit in the organs until they can make it into the veins. extra fluid in the organs can cause lots of problems, ranging from cell damage (e.g. the liver) to impairing its function (e.g. the lungs) to causing pain (e.g. the legs). leg swelling is a common symptom of heart failure, because gravity will make fluid stay in the legs. it's also the most obvious, because the leg physically swells. but the thing that often kills people with heart failure is the fluid in the lungs, because it fills up the airspaces in the lungs and prevents oxygen from making it into the body. salt causes water retention. water retention worsens heart failure. low-salt diets are a key treatment for heart failure, because it reduces the total amount of water in the body. fun fact, interfering with the kidney's salt exchange molecules is one of the key ways that our heart failure medications work, because it makes your body lose more salt in the urine, and this pulls water with it.</p>
<p>one of the worst things about human habits in 2019 is that our diets and lack of physical activity increases the risk of high blood pressure, kidney damage, and heart failure <em>at the same time</em>. and as an added bonus, it also increases the risk of diabetes, which independently also increases the risk of high blood pressure, kidney damage, and heart failure (and others! eye damage, even more/different heart damage, nerve damage, etc. diabetes is the worst). this means that health problems that are treated with low salt intake are fairly common.</p>
<p>the reason why low salt diets are a good idea for everyone, even healthy people, is that people get used to a certain level of salt in their food, and find food with less salt to be flavourless/not tasty. if you've grown up for 40+ years expecting food to taste a certain way, then eating the same thing with less salt can make it taste bad. so trying to get people who need a low-salt diet to be willing to eat less salt can be challenging. also most pre-made (including at restaurants) and processed foods are very high in salt, which also makes it difficult for a person on a low-salt diet to keep their intake low, even if they're willing. if people's environment--from the snacks they buy at the grocery store to the food their family makes when they're growing up--were more reasonably salted (i.e. lower salt than now), then it would make it way easier for people who have health problems that are affected by salt intake.</p>
<p>and that doesn't mean that we have to make food taste bad. people who grow up eating foods with less salt aren't 'missing out' on the flavour of having more salt in their food. they have a subjectively equally nice time eating something that's less salty, which they perceive to be well-salted. I know this first-hand too, because I grew up eating low-salt food (which I actually think is not low salt, but a normal amount of salt). I often find the restaurant food &amp; snack/junk food to be way too salty, to the point that it tastes very bad, while my friends find it to be just right. to OP' example of pickled plum, happen to be asian (chinese), and really dislike pickled plums because I think they taste heinous. their particular combination of salt with sweet &amp; sour just doesn't do it for me.</p>
<p>EDIT: I also didn't get into the contribution of sodium in particular to this conversation, which I want to flag now. <a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sodium/sodium-sources" target="_blank">This is a great article</a> that gets into some details. In general, sodium is also found in a lot of dietary sources beyond salt, as the positive cation to many other chemical compounds (food stabilizers, texture enhancers, even baking soda is NaHCO3, etc.). my advice for people who want/need to limit sodium is to look at nutritional labels.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>TL;DR: if you're healthy, salt intake is fine. salt restriction is an important part of treating a number of very common health problems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Note to anyone reading this thread: there's some really bad explanations of cardiovascular and renal physiology in here. You should probably take the information presented with a grain of salt.</p>
<p><strong>Edit edit:</strong>
Man you guys were viscous to the mods. In all fairness, my original post was a shitpost for the pun and I was too lazy to put in an explanation. I salute the mod to have let my post stand as a sticky even though it was obviously in violation of the rules here. </p>
<p><strong>Edit edit edit:</strong></p>
<p>Actual ELI5:</p>
<p>Salt isn't the main reason why people are healthy/unhealthy.</p>
<p>Quit your smoking and go exercise.</p>
<p>Salt goes in, salt goes out, ^you ^^can't ^^^explain ^^^^that</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>
<p>Some explanation to comply with Rule 3. None of the following should be taken as medical advice... except the quit smoking/exercise part. Do it.</p>
<p>I disagree with the premise that excessive salt is bad for you. Your body is pretty amazing at dealing with changes to its homeostasis; and an excess of anything is usually dealt with quite easily by the body.</p>
<p>With that said, I don't claim to have done an exhaustive search into the literature. My impression is that there probably isn't a double blind RCT comparing effect of purely high salt vs low salt over period of years without having confounders such as concurrent high caloric intake, exercise, co-morbidities, socioeconomic background, etc.; so many of the correlations that can be made between high salt diets and cardiovascular health are purely that - correlations. However, there probably isn't any harm in avoiding a high salt diet.</p>
<p>There may be some physiological principles that may be used to hypothesise cardiovascular change to chronic exposure to high salt loads and increased intra-vascular volume leading to chronic hypertension and myocardial remodeling, but for the average healthy person, I feel the overall effects are probably negligible. If anything, we may be too concerned with &quot;low salt&quot; that we ignore other things that have strong evidence for improved cardiovascular health - quitting smoking and <strong>exercise</strong>. Sure avoiding salt may or may not help your heart, but smoking and sitting on your backside all day is <strong>definitely</strong> a detrimental to your health.</p>
<p>Anyway some points on physiology I'd like to make:</p>
<p>Serum osmolality change of 1-2% is what is sensed by your osmoreceptors in your hypothalamus that stimulates thirst/ADH release.</p>
<p>Volume retention doesn't necessarily have to result in hypertension. In a healthy individual, increase intravascular volume and pressure on arteriole walls result in a reflex myogenic response which causes vessel dilatation and reduction in pressure (as per Hagen-Poiseuille's law). Obviously the effects of this may be limited depending on how much your intravascular volume expands by.</p>
<p>The reason why your heart may fail in volume overload isn't because the heart is working harder (a little bit), but mainly due to the left ventricular end diastolic volume being on the decompensated side of the Frank-Starling curve leading to impaired stroke volume and cardiac output. Yes, your heart does work a little bit harder against increased volume, but this is quite negligible compared to work against increased pressure.</p>
<p>The reason why the gent in the dialysis ward arrested is probably due to severe hyperkalaemia/acidosis; rather than volume expansion.</p>
<p>High salt diet is not a risk factor for colon cancer.</p>
<p>Sodium and potassium electrochemical gradients (as well as chloride and calcium) are responsible for resting membrane potential as well conductivity within the heart. It is important to keep electrolytes within a certain range to reduce the risk of arrythmias, but I can guarantee you that a little bit of salt here and there isn't going to change it by that much (unless you have end stage renal failure). The concern in regards to a high salt diet is due to above reasoning re volume overload +/- cardiac remodeling.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>too much salt is not bad for you because too much salt is impossible unless you have heart or kidney problems (or you have no access to fresh water). </p>
<p>Otherwise if you eat a lot of salt your body triggers a thirst response, you drink water, the salt gets absorbed into the water which goes into your bladder and you pee it out until you reach equilibrium.</p>

<p>money quote: <strong>This week a meta-analysis of seven studies involving a total of 6,250 subjects in the American Journal of Hypertension found no strong evidence that cutting salt intake reduces the risk for heart attacks, strokes or death in people with normal or high blood pressure.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
