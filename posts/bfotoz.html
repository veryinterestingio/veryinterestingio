<p>The human body needs to have a good supply of nutrients at certain key points in life (ex. puberty) to grow properly. Children in poverty-stricken areas without the same access exhibit stunted growth. As we can assume, people hundreds of years ago didn't have the same food choices we have today in the same way as the poor kids.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main factor is nutrition lets us grow to our full potential, in the past people rarely got enough to eat, today it's the opposite, people eat too much. Hygiene and health is another, the body can focus on growing instead of fighting off disease.</p>
<p>Finally hormones and pseudo hormones in our environment and food might help boost growth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The key word is famine.<br />
If you experience malnutrition as a child you will be shorter than you would otherwise be. From a biological standpoint it's a sane choice. You'll use less energy during the period of starvation, and you'll also develop less bodymass in an environment where starvation is a strong possibility.  </p>
<p>As such human average height has always varied depending on climate and how well the population was able to feed itself. During the height of the middle-ages and the medieval warm period people were not much shorter than we are today. A few centimenters, but that's expected in a society where food is such a central issue that 90% of the population has to be involved in food production. No refrigeration or advanced techniques for preserving foodstuffs also meant that during the winters the food was frequently of lower quality than it is today.<br />
The shortest people have been in known history was during the &quot;Little ice age&quot; a period during the 17th and 18th century where the summers were short, the winters were harsh and Europe was frequently ravaged by war and famine. It's in this period that humans  are 10-15cm shorter than the modern man, giving rise to the myth of &quot;how much taller we are than our ancestors&quot;, when in reality for most of history the different is just 3-5cm compared to the modern average.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5: Nutrition is part of the reason people grow taller now, but pooping in the toilet is another part. When people don't bury their poop, children get sick from bacteria and parasites which makes them grow less tall.</p>
<p>ELIPHD: Nutrition is the largest factor in height difference over the last hundred years, but open defecation is another very important factor which I haven't seen mentioned here. The human immune system adapts in childhood depending on environment. In areas where open defecation is common (e.g. rural India) children's immune systems take so much energy fighting off infection that it stunts their grow significantly. The difference in open defecation practices and population density explain the height difference between parts of rural rural India and rural Africa where nutrition is similarly poor.1</p>
<p>Interestingly, the practice of open defecation was only stopped in the southern United States fairly recently due to a Rockefeller study on the difference between the southern and northern state's productivity.2 It was found that the cause of the productivity difference was anemia due to hookworm infections which are spread by open defecation. Hookworm is a significant cause of stunted growth in humans, and again has to do with the immune system, but is complicated by the active relationship between the hookworm parasite and the human immune system. Hookworm can travel up to six feet from feces, and hookworm infections stopped when people started burying their feces six feet deep.</p>
<p>On a further tangent, the relationship between the hookworm parasite and the human immune system is a complex one that goes way back in human evolution. It turns out to be the case that hookworms actively regulate the human immune system. Stopping the practice of open defecation in the developed world has lead to the rise of allergies, asthma and immune disorders at much higher rates than in places where the practice of open defecation is still common. In some extreme cases of immune disorders some studies starting to infect patients with hookworm as a treatment.3</p>
