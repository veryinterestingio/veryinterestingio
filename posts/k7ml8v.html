		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well emotions aren’t just feelings, they’re biochemical reactions. Grief includes a lot of stress chemicals (cortisol, etc) and you don’t get enough of the happy chemicals and endorphins. Your body doesn’t function well in this state.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hormones.</p>
<p>Love, fun, grief, fear etc. are all tied to hormones. Different hormone types are rising/lowering through different feelings. And all these hormones have impacts on your muscles.</p>
<p>So, when you grief, your hormone levels are adjusted and your muscles have less activity than usual. You end up exhausted.</p>
<p>For example, fear adjusts your hormones to fight or flight, meaning a huge boost to your muscles, either for fight or flight.</p>
<p>Edit: &quot;nothing permanent&quot; part was wrong. So, I deleted it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Grief is fundamentally an elevated state. What does that mean? Well think of your &quot;normal&quot; state. You have very little or no stress, you aren't particularly hungry or thirsty, you aren't tired or sick. You're in relative balance.  </p>
<p>But your body is still working. Your body still metabolizes the last food you ate to power your brain just enough to achieve consciousness. Just &quot;seeing&quot; is itself an energy-intensive process that requires energy. The eyes need to be open and sensitive to light, the connections between your eyes and brain need to pass along the information it receives to the brain, and the brain needs to <em>process</em> what that information <em>means.</em> you also need to regulate your body temperature, repair skin as you shed dead skin cells, etc. Without considering doing what we consider basic tasks like moving our bodies when we walk or lift a glass or water to drink.</p>
<p>Grief is a special kind of <em>stress.</em> If you only consider your brain, you have some new information that caused this grief, and that causes all kinds of new demands on the brain, like high-level thinking about what it means to you, and changes to your mood begin triggering hormonal processes to try to find &quot;balance.&quot; Your brain thinks &quot;oh, you are sad, heres some extra stuff you might need&quot; because it isn't very good at deciding exactly how you feel and how to fix it. You get flooded with new levels of chemicals to combat these feelings, and all of this is like a chemical plant that requires energy to fuel it, and your body then needs to eventually process and absorb these &quot;new&quot; chemicals as well.</p>
<p>Grief is what we call this feeling of intense emotional reactions and the feelings that come along with it, but they are stressful on your body because your body requires energy to do <em>anything.</em> This is a strain on precious resources your body usually doesn't need to account for. It's a kind of stress.</p>
<p>I hope this was moderately helpful. It's normal to feel very tired after intense emotional episodes. I hope you get some rest!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding to some good answers, in grief you often do not sleep well, forget to eat and drink, and neglect general physical well-being. That takes a toll and your physical and emotional state feed into each other. It’s important to take care of yourself, even if eating a little food and getting a few stretches in is all you can manage for the day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
