		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Due to the increased market penetration of intermittent renewable energy and the inflexibility of nuclear and <del>fossil fuel</del> <strong>some conventional power</strong> plants, many electricity markets occasionally have negative electricity prices when demand is low and supply is high. See for instance <a href="https://insights.abnamro.nl/en/2019/04/german-spot-electricity-prices-went-negative/" target="_blank">this article</a> about German electricity prices:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The inflexibility or financial infeasibility to shut down or ramp up/down base-load power stations – during hours of high renewable energy generation – only aggravates the imbalance between demand and supply. It might seem counter intuitive, but in some cases paying the buyer for purchasing electricity is cheaper than turning off power stations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I understand that it can be more profitable keep the power plant running due to the costs of ramping up or down. But I wonder why electricity suppliers (pay to) deliver their electricity to the net rather than destroy it via grounding or leakage to the earth?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are talking on the scale of megawatts here. Grounding is a safety feature to prevent people from being accidentally electrocuted, and the earth is not intended to be an electrical dumping ground for enormous and constant amounts of electricity. Mythbusters showed that when a power line falls down the ground is electrified to the point that a human walking on the ground near it would be fried. So let's not do that sort of thing intentionally.</p>
<p>As for dealing with the excess, I heard a story about one power company that could, when there was excess capacity, have the city turn on street lights during the day to use the excess capacity. Can't remember where I read that but sounds easy to find. Germany's position (geographically) in Europe probably lets it sell excess capacity to its neighbouring EU countries as well.</p>
<p>All this highlights a problem with the grid: there's almost zero storage. Tesla's Power Wall and similar products help but should be more widely available. Plus we'd need some kind of signalling that it's happening and that the price of electricity just went negative to signal those power walls and other power consumers (eg: electric cars plugged in waiting for time to charge) to begin consuming some electricity, and how much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Source: spent way too much time in Oroville, CA where the reservoir is set up like this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You cannot &quot;destroy&quot; the electrical energy, you can convert it to something else, usually heat.  If you connect your power output to ground (earth) the the electricity will convert into heat.  Megawatts of electrical energy will turn into megawatts of heat.  This is perfectly feasible, if you have something that can handle that much heat.  If you simple connect the wires to ground then lots of current will flow, and either the circuit breakers trip, or the wires melt from all that heat.</p>
<p>If this situation happened often it might make sense for the power company to build a device to convert excess electricity into heat.  That would cost money to build, and money to operate.  It would probably use a lot of cooling water.  The price of electricity would have to go negative often and by a large amount to make building a way to dump the electricity cost effective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can't just &quot;destroy&quot; electricity. This is fundamental physics here, energy cannot be created or destroyed, merely change form.</p>
<p>To get rid of electric energy, you need to convert it into some other type of energy. There's a couple of options for this.</p>
<p>Thermal energy: we can turn electricity into heat by simply pushing it through a resistive load. However, we're taking about <em>millions</em> of watts of power here, that amount of heat is almost impossible to deal with. You'd end up heating a large area around the energy dump. The most viable solution would probably be a man made lake with huge heating coils sunk in the bottom. That much water can store a massive amount of heat, but it would be ecologically harmful.</p>
<p>Chemical energy: batteries, basically. You convert the electric energy into chemical energy stored between molecules to be recovered later. This is <em>hideously</em> expensive to do at the kind of scale we need. It's simply not viable on a nationwide scale at this time. Maybe in the near future.</p>
<p>Potential/kinetic energy: very similar things here, we use the electricity to move something. Later on, that thing can be moved back to release the energy back into the electric grid. One major technology right now is water resivoirs. You build two big resivoirs, one as high above the other as the landscape can provide. You use excess energy to pump water uphill, then later you can let the water fall back down through a turbine to generate electricity. The bad part about this is that you actually can't store as much energy as you'd think. It doesn't scale well because it requires so much land area in a very special landscape.</p>
<p>Sinking the current back into the ground is essentially shorting out the generator. This will generate a <em>lot</em> of heat in a real big hurry. Whatever wires you use will likely vaporize, causing an extremely dangerous arc that can blind, burn, electrocute, and otherwise kill the fuck out of anyone nearby.</p>
<p>Tldr, we can't just get rid of excess electricity. The energy has to go <em>somewhere</em>, and there is simply way, WAY too much energy to dispose of in a reasonable way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If a utility (or customer) wants to destroy electricity instead of put it to good use, my understanding is that you would use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_bank" target="_blank">Load Bank</a>.  At their simplest, these are heating coils and fans (or an industrial paint dryer, or some other cheap high-usage device).  </p>
<p>I don't know how far up those can scale, but I suspect they are not practical to build/use at power station scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
