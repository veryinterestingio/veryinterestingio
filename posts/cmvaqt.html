		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR; because in healthy adults it's all controlled by muscles. They can be trained to tell your brain you really need to pee when you have only a little bit in the bladder just as easily as if you have a lot. And this can fluctuate depending on your lifestyle, and other factors such as as you age, or whether you have a medical condition, etc. </p>
<p>Long bit: The muscle in your bladder wall is called the detrusor. The detrusor muscle is what expands to allow your bladder to fill and contracts to allow your pee to come out. It's all controlled by nerves telling you when you need to go and they begin to open the internal urinary spincter when it's time, but you also have control over when you pee (unless you have, say, an infection or other disease altering the normal mechanisms). You have control because you have control over certain muscles, like the external urinary sphincter which acts like a wall against the pee wanting to come out. The bladder holds (generally) around 200ish mils before you'll start to feel like you need to pee, and around 500ish mils before you have to actively 'hold it in'. </p>
<p>Interestingly the amount needed before you feel like you really have to pee is variable and depends on age, gender, but also how you've trained your bladder to react. If you go to the bathroom as soon as you feel a little urge (or like some women you go 'just in case') you start to train your bladder to send the urge signals to the brain when it has less in it, so you start to get the urge signals at 150ml rathern than 200, and the 'absolutely desperate to go' starts happening with less bladder contents.</p>
<p>Many other conditions like UTIs, in some pregnancies, impacted bowels, etc can all affect the space that your bladder has to expand so will change the urge feelings. Also tea/coffee acts as diuretics and will send more water to be eliminated than if you didn't drink them.</p>
<p>The nice thing is that you can re-train your bladder to hold more contents. This doesn't mean you hold it in all day, some places suggest going between 6-8 times a day if you drink the recommended amount of water a day is normal. It means the first moment you get that 'oh I think I need to pee' feeling, don't immediately go to the bathroom and don't go to the bathroom as a preventative measure. Also pelvic floor exercises can help strengthen your pelvic floor which will help with how strong the detrusor muscle contracts. But, like with all things, if you are worried about your pee habits then go see your doctor. They can help :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the subjective feeling of how badly you need to pee (what you call sense) isn't a raw signal from the receptors in the bladder wall that &quot;report&quot; how much the wall is being stretched. The signal is influenced on its way from the bladder to your concius experience by multiple filters in both the spinal cord and brain. As an example most people know that being in a nervous/tensed emotional state will increase the need to pee, and that the feeling can be suppressed consciously for a while if for example you are in a situation where you can't pee.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
