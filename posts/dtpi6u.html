		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not all hairs are created equally. Most have a maximum length they can achieve before regular wear-and-tear causes them to fall off. Arm hairs will stop growing after a couple of months, whereas the hair on the head grows for a few years before it stops.   </p>
<p>Hair growth occurs in phases. The first phase is called the <em>anagen</em> phase, and it's the only time that hair actively grows. How long your own anagen phase is will be dependent on your genes. This is why some people just can't grow beards, or can't ever seem to get their hair as long as they want it to be. The typical anagen phase for a healthy adult for head-hair is between 2 and 6 years, long enough to grow around 1 to 3 feet. The typical anagen phase for arm hair is between 3 and 8 weeks, maxing it out at one or two inches.</p>
<p>Once the anagen phase is over, it enters into the <em>catagen</em> phase. All the growing is done, but you might actually gain a little bit of length hear as the follicle pushes the hair out before it begins to grow another strand of hair. </p>
<p>After catagen comes <em>telogen</em>, the resting phase, where the follicle sits dormant for a while (up to several months). This is when the old, dead hair falls off/gets pushed out. After that, it goes back to the anagen phase.</p>
<p>And thankfully, all of this is staggered all over our (human) bodies. At any given moment, some of our hair is in any one of the three phases. Whereas for animals like long-furred dogs or sheep, it all happens at at the same time in the form of summer/winter shedding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your hair grows in cycles. The max length of the hair on any specific part of your body basically tells you how long the growing cycle is for those hair follicles. When the cycle is over, the hair will fall out. Every follicle has its own cycle, they are not in sync with each other, so you don't notice that they are all falling out eventually.</p>
<p>For example arms and legs have a very short cycle while your head has a very long cycle, and then there's everything in between like that one random long hair that you find on your ear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The top comment is a great answer. I just wanted to add that your body has different types of hair. Indeterminate and determinate. </p>
<p>Indeterminate is the hair on your head. It can keep growing as long as it's in the right phase.</p>
<p>Determinate hair is the hair everything else. Your genes tell it what length it should be and when to stop. For example your eyebrows are determinate so they don't get so long to cover your eyes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If it is pulled out it just grows back again over time. We have no idea why the alpha hair grows so much longer than the rest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
