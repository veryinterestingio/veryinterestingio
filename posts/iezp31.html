		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best way I’ve seen this described (another time this question was asked here) is that your digestive system is like a train. You load cars on the the track, and its job is to get them to their destination. When you have good, functional cars going on the track, all moves according to plan. However, if you load a busted car on the track, the conductor has to get it off as quickly as possible. If it can’t be taken off where it went on, the only solution is to put <em>the entire train</em> on ludicrous speed to clear the tracks so that bad car can be removed. So your body throws normal digestion and efficiency to the wind and pulls an emergency lever that sends all the cars hurtling to their Final Destination.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Using coffee as an example seeing as I know it first hand - the chemicals in coffee speed up your lower gut. So you drink the coffee, the chemicals involved (caffeine is one, but not the only) are absorbed quickly through the stomach/top of the small intestine. These circulate in your blood, reach the large intestine and kick things up a notch. Not long before you* need to rush to the restroom. </p>
<p>Another mechanism is that if  you eat a lot you will speed up the back end to make room. </p>
<p>Thing is you haven't sped up the whole production line, just the last step. Think of it as Ford putting a rush order on the 5 cars at the end of the line. Those 5 cars are ready quicker, but now you have a space in the production line. Paint takes time to dry, nothing will change that. In the same manner food takes time to digest and nothing can change that. </p>
<p>* Or maybe not, some people aren't affected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called gastrocolic reflex. In order to digest the food, bowel have to contract with rhythmical, synchronized movements that push the &quot;food&quot; forward (it's called peristalsis).
When you eat, the food you ingest stretches the stomach wall, and that starts a reflex that generates contraction waves (peristaltic waves) that propagates all the way down in the bowels wall, moving what's already inside it, in the rectum, that is previously produced poop.</p>
<p>In fewer words, it's a physiological reflex triggered by the stretch of stomach walls.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In My case, I get it everytime after I eat. Whenever I go out to eat, I have to make sure there is a toilet nearby as I will need to poop almost immediately after finishing. This is because of my IBS, which there is not really alot the docs can do about it, because they don't understand it. Doesn't give you the best quality of life when you're out and about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nothng here seems to answer the actual question as I assume it was intended:</p>
<p>- If it typically takes a long time for peristalsis to transport food through the digestive system, is it really the case that sometimes, when you eat food that disagrees with you, a relatively short while later (&lt;1 hr) you can be expelling that same food (presumably along with everything else that was upstream of it in your gut), with it having travelled \~30 feet or so through your body? or is something else going on? is your whole tract essentially empty after such an episode?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
