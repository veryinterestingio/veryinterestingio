		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A number of reasons, some of which go back hundreds of years. More or less in chronological order, they are:</p>
<p>- Legibility: Handwriting conventions are a compromise between readability and the mechanics of the human hand. While any human can conceivably fashion highly readable letters similar (or even identical) to those used in printing, it is impractical for most people to do so, and so how we're taught to draw letters is usually a convention based on compromise. But printed letters are not limited by human needs, and can be absolutely anything. There are millions of typefaces in the world, but they fall into broad categories, and most are devised to be easy to read, using long-established practices found to help with that. Printed letters are generally more readable because they <strong>can</strong> be, and follow forms that are known to help with that but which are harder or slower for most humans to draw clearly and reliably, such as the &quot;a&quot; and &quot;g&quot; glyphs you refer to.</p>
<p>- Legacy: Once these conventions were established, they became standard for nearly all typography, starting a very long time ago. Many other factors have influenced their specific design since, and many of those results also became legacy conventions.</p>
<p>- Efficiency: Automation in typography required strict standardization of form. When you've invested in a huge expensive machine like a Linotype, you're pretty much bound to one typeface, and it better be one that's versatile enough to handle a wide range of content. Longstanding typographic conventions developed over many years of movable-type printing helped to establish these conventions. Consideration such as how a letter may look if it's over-exposed or over-inked on a certain kind of paper influenced these designs, and the specific glyphs that became standard were those found to most reliably serve the goal of legibility under the widest range of conditions. The double-loop lower-case &quot;g&quot; glyph has a shape that is recognizable even when malprinted.</p>
<p>- Efficiency, again: When printing moved to digital, the shapes we knew were instead approximated with dots in a matrix, and there was a memory cost that had to to be accounted for. It was important that characters not 'cost' too much. Simplification of form helped make data-processing more efficient, at a time when RAM was counted in kilobytes (instead of today's gigabytes) and CPU speed was counted in kHz.</p>
<p>- Legacy, again: Today's computers inherit the conventions of earlier ones, even though they're much faster and more efficient, and that includes many of the small changes made to glyphs during the metal-to-digital transition of half a century ago. This isn't due to laziness, but because they glyphs we have work well, and always have, so there's no special need to change them.</p>
<p>- Where do we go from here? There is much room for improvement in the digital-to-paper transfer that still constitutes the vast bulk of professional and commercial printing. Permanent legal documents may involve thousands, millions, or even billions of dollars, or other assets that are great in some way (huge tracts of land, for example), and therefore readability remains a very important goal. Yet a great deal of this important documentation is poorly printed and not as readable as it should be. There's a market there for someone who wants to research the path that a character takes from original conception to digital composition to final impression on different kinds, sizes, and formats of paper, to figure out which will work best and most reliably. (Not just glyphs, either, but the dicey DPI-to-LPI transition, relative image density, and more.) Newspapers and magazines made a huge investment in that in the past, because they would find out right away if there was a problem when complaints came in. Today's professionals don't have that immediate feedback, and so are not making the same effort, and that risks a growing number of situations where those who created some text might not be around to explain it when someone else can't read it down the road. Proactive research would help prevent that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Another reason would be, as u/glyttch posted in another thread,  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Partly because of old printing presses with handset type. The lettering used on old presses could become worn, making that a look like an o, or vice versa. By using the a we know in common typefaces today readers could easily distinguish between an actual a and a worn o.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also,  Œ± actually is lowercase Œë in Greek.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
