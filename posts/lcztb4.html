		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Migraines or headaches are mostly perceived through a specific nerve - the trigeminal nerve. This nerve innervates (or ends at) the meninges - which are like a layer of skin that protects your brain. These meninges DO have pain receptors and the signal of pain can be transported via the trigeminal nerve into your brain. Usually <strong>headaches</strong> are caused by irritation or traction of the meninges or the surrounding tissue (e.g. blood vessels).</p>
<p>Now, <strong>migraine</strong> episodes are a little bit different and are not fully understood. It is however believed that these episodes or attacks are also caused by sudden irritation of blood vessels, meninges,  or maybe a general malfunctioning of specific brain areas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a doctor, but I am a chronic migraine sufferer and this is how it's been explained to me.</p>
<p>Migraines are different, in that they aren't headaches, they are neurological conditions with symptoms that manifest as headaches. I get the normal headache/nausea/aura kind but I also have vestibular migraine than manifests as a severe ear infection-like pain plus vertigo/nausea/confusion.</p>
<p>It seems like (and I'm being vague because migraines aren't super well understood) the migraine is your brain screwing up and attacking/misfiring various nerves. So it's not the brain hurting, it's the brain getting its signals very crossed and causing other parts of you to suffer.</p>
<p>There are also ocular migraines and abdominal migraines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I've literally just finished my dissertation on this... Well actually it focused on Posture and Cervicogenic headaches (still a hot topic of debate in the research community)</p>
<p>ELI5: staring at your lap all day (phone, laptop) over a long time causes changes in the structure of your neck and how they tell the brain what is painful.</p>
<p>Elaboration:
Most of my research was based around the relationship between Posture and headaches. Specifically Upper Crossed Syndrome (UCS) and forward head posture (FHP). Both of which are postural adaptations with a gradual onset.
FHP is usually seen as extension of the upper cervical spine (C0-C3) flexion of the lower cervical spine. The C2-C3 area is where the trigeminal and occipital nerves &quot;meet&quot; (for lack of a better word) and pain information from both nerves can get mixed up, referring pain to the head (occipital) and face (trigeminal)</p>
<p>Disclaimer: my approach to this topic was based on my knowledge of anatomy and physiology as a sports therapist and so my total understanding of the neurophysiology of the brain and neural interactions in the spinal cord is far below that of any pain specialist</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
