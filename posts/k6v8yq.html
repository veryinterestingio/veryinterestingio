		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because of the different senses they are using to get in and out.</p>
<p>Flies get into houses because they are searching for food.  Flies find food by smell.  Smell diffuses through air.  So imagine a fly trying to get into your house.  If it comes to a closed window, it can't smell food through the window so it ignores it.  If there's an open crack at the bottom of the window or an open door or something, it can smell the food and will follow the scent through the opening, which will actually let it get inside, because usually where the smell is going out there is an actual passage for the fly going in.  The exception here is screen doors and windows, and sometimes you <em>will</em> see flies buzzing all around those trying to get inside and failing, because they can't follow the smell.  </p>
<p>Flies bump into glass windows but can't escape because flies, when not following a scent towards food, are attracted to light.  Flies aren't very smart, so they usually just home in on the brightest light source.  Inside a house, the light source is usually the window.  The fly doesn't really understand glass, so it keeps banging against it trying to fly toward the light.  It's not smart enough to realize it isn't making progress and search around for another way out.</p>
<p>To sum up: Flies following the light to leave a house tend to run into an impassible barrier (glass) while flies following smells to get into a house tend to find actual openings (open cracks, open doors).  So they get in more easily than they get out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From another argument, you can think of flies entering your house as particles diffusing through a permeable barrier. The concentration of flies in your house is normally zero, and the concentration of flies outside your house is always greater than zero. If you leave your windows open long enough, a fly will enter. It will have the same difficulty leaving as it did entering so long as it's not having to push through a dense wall of flies on the way out.</p>
<p>I guess you can also extend this thought to anything. The concentration of lions in your house is also probably zero. But considering how low it is outside as well the rate of diffusion will be close to zero as well. Birds get in your house through the window sometimes because there's a much higher concentration of them outside than lions, and flies get in your house even more often because there are still more flies than there are birds. I think.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>they like it inside, e.g. because it smells of food.  </li>
<li>selective perception; you notice it way more if a fly enters your rooms than if one exits.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have similar situation right now. There is a bee hive next to my bedroom window. Normally doesn't bother me at all. But sometimes when it gets too hot outside, some of them sneak from the tiny gap between the window pan and can't get back out at all. Then they just buzz on the glass till they die. So I pass time by giving those bees sugar syrup and trapping them in a cup and releasing them outside..</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the same reason you rarely see a person when the lottery twice.</p>
<p>For any one <em>particular</em> person to win the lottery is almost impossible.</p>
<p>But we know <em>someone</em> is bound to win.</p>
<p>But the chances that the same particular someone wins <em>twice</em>? Very unlikely.</p>
<p>That's the situation you have with flies. You've got a swarm outside, which one gets lucky and gets in by sheer luck. But the odds of it stumbling to it's way back out is just as unlikely as the fact that it got in in the first place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
