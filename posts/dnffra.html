		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1) It's far cheaper to build a house out of wood and insure it against loss than to build a concrete house.</p>
<p>2) Getting hit by a tornado is actually an extremely rare event, such that many people live in tornado alley for <em>years</em> without even seeing one.</p>
<p>3) A direct hit from a strong tornado has the ability to obliterate brick and concrete, and EF5's have done significant damage to even reinforced concrete structures (e.g. hospitals, civic centers, and the like).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A tornado is a rare occurrence for any given house. The chances that your particular house will be hit over your lifetime is very small. My father's house in Salina, Kansas was really only threatened by a tornado once in 70 years. It destroyed the trees in the front yard but hadn't touched down yet. Drive through old towns in tornado alley, you'll see a lot of 100-year-old homes. They only get to be 100 years old because a tornado never hit them.</p>
<p>You can't make people triple the cost of their houses because of a small chance they'll be hit by a tornado. That's not economically feasible.</p>
<p>I remember a week I spent in Wichita and they were discussing (on TV) a law they were considering: every trailer park must have a tornado shelter big enough to shelter all the residents. Sounds reasonable, right. That's where the discussion went from happy-world to real-world. The cost of a tornado shelter that size was more than the trailer park made in rent in 2 years in most cases. More than 2 years in many cases. Maintaining that shelter was also a significant added cost. The residents really couldn't afford to pay for the shelter via increased rents. The landowner can't afford to be without the income for 2 years.</p>
<p>So the only recourse the trailer park owner would have was close the trailer park and find another use for the land. You essentially pass a law to help people and end up displacing thousands of people who have nowhere else to live.</p>
<p>Same with the wood to concrete conversion. It's too expensive. Not only that, but even a concrete house isn't going to withstand a semi-truck trailer being dropped on it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If they do get destroyed, they're quick and cheap to rebuild.</p>
<p>Nothing more to it.  On a cost Vs benefit analysis, it's not worth it</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even in tornado-prone areas, the odds of a particular house being hit by a tornado are extremely low. Tornados are devastating, but their damage is confined to a very small area (by natural disaster standards). It’s just not economical to build every house as a tornado-proof concrete bunker, plus they’d be horribly uncomfortable during the winters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are talking being in a building hit directly by a tornado, neither structure would survive.  Generally buildings are meant to resist everyday damages but it is simply unrealistic to build structures meant to survive extreme conditions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
