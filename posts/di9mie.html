<p>Once an object is airborne, the human brain is (with practice) extremely good at calculating the expected trajectory.  The physics involved is predictable and repeatable - gravity and air density do not change significantly, only wind.</p>
<p>We presumably evolved to be very good at this so that our spears and javelins could be lethal from great range when hunting.  You don't really want to get within kickin' distance of a water buffalo if you don't have to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Practice. Practice practice practice. </p>
<p>Gravity is very predictable. All things on earth all the time forever will fall at 9.8 meters per second per second, barring air resistance. Similarly, as Newton explained, objects in motion tend to stay in motion unless acted upon - again, ignoring air resistance something moving horizontally relative to the Earth will continue going that same speed. </p>
<p>And, sure, you can't <em>really</em> ignore air resistance, especially for things that aren't very dense. Still, most things most of the time are going to follow the same arc when thrown.</p>
<p>Brains are really good at seeing patterns. All animals with a brain need part of that brain to help them navigate the world. That means spacial reasoning to be able to predict its own movement and the movement of predators or prey, so that you can successfully navigate towards food and safety and away from danger. </p>
<p>Humans are particularly good at two dimensional falling motion because our ancestors were climbers. They got around through brachiation - swinging on their arms from branch to branch. Failing to correctly calculate our momentum plus gravity meant falling, which meant injury or being attacked by waiting predators. But most animals can predict the path of a thrown object pretty well if they have eyes good enough to follow it. </p>
<p>But mostly it's just practice. You see falling things pretty much every day of your life. You throw things, you see things thrown, you see things moving up and down and sideways. Again, thrown things are <em>really</em> predictable so it doesn't take long for you to figure it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Motion tracking is a skill that is important to many species. A dog learns to chase a Frisbee and snatch it out of the air. A raptor can dive and pluck a fast moving target out of the air.</p>
<p>Humans are much more unique in throwing, mostly due to our shoulders and incredibly versatile hands. </p>
<p>Tracking and predicting the motion of moving objects is just a common skill among sighted vertebrates. It's refined by learning and collecting data but a lot of the hardware is also built in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I cannot for the life of me find the study I read a few years ago, but it appears to be trained through repetition.  There was a study done years ago in space that showed removing gravity threw off catching reflexes.  We're trained to see acceleration due to gravity and in zero g it the astronauts involved would 'catch' too early.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
