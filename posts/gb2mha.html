<h2>ELI5 summary</h2>
<p>Your old computer can probably run nearly as fast as it ever could. Some hardware components can wear down or suffer from errors with time, but that's likely not the issue. Go plug in your 1990's video gaming consoles - they can still play games designed for them. Instead, the major issue is that you're no longer using an old computer to run old programs. Modern programs and websites aren't designed for your old hardware, so your computer will struggle to run them, leading to slower performance.</p>
<hr />
<h2>original post</h2>
<p>A lot of answers are addressing software bloat issues, but OP assumes the computer has a slowdown after a factory reset. So, let's roll with that assumption. </p>
<p>The main issue will be the modernization of the software you'll choose to run off the reformatted machine. If you're running 1990's software on your 1990's laptop, there shouldn't be an issue. But chances are you're not. Newer software is made with the intention of running on newer hardware. This applies to browsing the web as well. For example, modern sites load more background scripts nowadays.</p>
<p>The answer could involve hardware degradation, but probably not your CPU or RAM. CPU's, for example, are built to last and don't have much redundancy, so any transistor failure will likely result in a crash. </p>
<p>Your HDD or SSD storage, on the other hand, do degrade with use.</p>
<p>HDD's can wear down <del>as the mechanical arm makes more and more passes over the disk</del> (edit: I used haphazard wording here. Your drive can develop bad sectors. The effect is typically minimal but in a very damaged case could be  massive. See comments.) </p>
<p>SSD's store data as charge in different cells, whose lining definitely wears with charge transfer. Read and write speeds will then take more time, as your computer accounts for errors from faulty cells. Still, this wear takes a while to accumulate. </p>
<p>You could swap your drive for a newer one to see if it helps... and it probably will, but mostly because of improved drive technology.</p>
<p>edit: There could also be a psychological perspective. You've undoubtedly used other machines. Your experience with, say, your brand new smart phone could clash with your experience on a machine whose hardware is no longer explicitly supported by developers.</p>
<p>The main culprit, though, is the additional load on your hardware that modern programs require. Old machines can't cut it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The computer doesn't just become slow over time. I have a computer here at work with the original windows XP service pack one and it has never been connected to the internet. You'd swear it has an SSD in it because it boots up in mere seconds.</p>
<p>Computers become slow because of software updates becoming increasingly more bloated and demand faster components just to get the same performance you got with earlier versions.</p>
<p>It's sort of a double edged sword though because if you don't update your software, you're less secure, but if you update, you're more secure but your computer may be slower.</p>
<p>Great question OP!!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One major reason is your computer is doing different things. This is especially true if you are running modern software or using the WWW. For example, Wirth's Law says that software is getting slower faster than hardware is getting faster, so your computing experience should be getting slower as time marches on. If your computer is from 2011, it probably runs software from 2011 well, as that software was written efficiently. Modern software in generally is written less efficiently as programmers use easier tools to write software in. On the WWW side, web pages are orders of magnitude more demanding for computer resources than they were even just a decade ago.</p>
<p>Part of it can be the hardware itself, though. One thing I haven't seen mentioned is that your CPU can just be running slower now (at a lower clock speed). The reason is that old computers fill up with dust or their fans stop working well. When your computer gets too hot, it automatically slows down the CPU (called &quot;throttling&quot;) to keep from overheating. If your computer is dusty or your fans have not been lubricated recently, it's possible that your CPUs are essentially permanently throttled due to not being able to dissipate heat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>None of these other comments are ELI5 material. When your computer is new, it's like you're single and you just bought a new house. There's nothing in it, there's tons of room to do whatever you want and it seems you can do anything and put anything you want inside and never run out of room. </p>
<p>Well 5 years later, you have a family and some kids, and now your house is full of garbage and extra junk. It's hard to walk around, there's no room to do anything, and you physically can't fit anything more in your house. </p>
<p>So one day, you decide to throw out all the garbage and junk you've gathered over the years (like a factory reset/format). The problem is you still have your spouse and your two kids (the newer, modern programs and apps you like to use). Your spouse and kids still take up resources and space that weren't there before, so even though you got rid of all the junk it still won't be the same. </p>
<p>Now if you threw out all your junk, got a divorce and released custody of your kids - then your house will feel just like it did 5 years ago.</p>
<p>But you will also be a sad empty husk of a human.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Web sites grow by the day, basically. The resources needed to render Facebook in 2020 is likely an order of magnitude greater than in 2010.</p>
<p>You also have things like video formats that offer better compression, but in return require more cpu power and/or memory.</p>
<p>Perhaps a really neat optimization trick in some software turned out to cause security holes, so the program was updated to be safer, but slower.</p>
<p>These are a small selection of things that cause computers to run slower even if they do exactly as many calculations now as they did a decade ago. There's just so much more stuff that they need to do now that they can get overwhelmed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
