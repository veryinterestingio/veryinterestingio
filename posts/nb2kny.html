		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You consciously choose a goal to achieve. If it's a really simple goal that you've done many times, the brain often relies on the unconscious mind to take care of it. E.g., when you're really good at riding a bike, you no longer have to use conscious effort to think so hard about how to balance and what you're doing. You just do it (your less conscious brain is doing it). </p>
<p>However, that also leaves the possibility that it will make the wrong choice. Your conscious thoughts wander, the goal becomes less activated in the mind, and you overall (both consciously and unconsciously) lose track of what you originally meant to do. Often, you will substitute in a related but incorrect goal. </p>
<p>E.g., I meant to pour milk into my cereal and pour myself a glass of orange juice. Instead, I poured orange juice into my cereal. Oops. </p>
<p>Even for carefully controlled conscious tasks you can still mess up. That is usually just from the imperfection inherent to life. The mouse you're using isn't perfect. The calibration between your brain estimating where the mouse will go and where it actually will go is not perfect either. If your attention slips (as it does for simple things), you may click a littler earlier or later than you should have. This can happen even if you are paying full attention just because we're not perfect. We are frequently wrong. The way the brain works is by being good enough to get by, basically, not perfect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of complex thought that comes from simpler thoughts and desires. Since we have 2 modes of thinking, fast and slow, sometimes &quot;fast&quot; thoughts, more primitive thoughts (coming from the brain stem), will make us do things before we realize why, before we form a &quot;slow&quot;, complex, thought as to why we do it. </p>
<p>But I'm not a psychologist. This explanation is a simplification from what I read in &quot;Thinking fast and slow&quot;, and a few videos here or there. I assume it also would be responsible for the behaviors you mention, but I have not done research about it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think most people find this to be quite startling to realize, but with a bit of understanding we'd find the truth was apparent the entire time - <em>We</em> are not entirely our<em>selves</em>.</p>
<p>Those little glitches happen constantly. The more obvious ones are a rarity.</p>
<p>Something as simple (and naturally occurring) as a strong mood or night of bad sleep changes the way we interpret and respond to reality dramatically. This is even the case when it comes to complex circumstances. Everyone has heard a friend say a casual phrase in good humor, only to find themselves reacting as if it was some sort of veiled attack or a sign of trouble. Alternatively, we've all surely realized days late that what we thought was a compliment was, obviously, an insult. And this is complex stuff - this is conscious analysis combined with our experience with social nuance... And both fail in the face of a simple neurochemical imbalance?</p>
<p>We've all awoken from dreams to find a jacket hanging from a chair has suddenly become something different. It becomes something menacing with vicious intent, its shape dripping with the insinuated threat of a shadowy intruder. And in a flash we've responded with a spike of adrenaline and a hastily sketched response even as the experience rapidly fades into baffling irrelevance. The mind regains consensus. Your planned response is deleted offhandedly with barely a trace. The brain quickly corrects the scene with such casual grace that it seems absurd to imagine how the mistake could have been made in the first place (if it weren't for a rapidly fading freeze-frame memory or the already slowing beat of your heart).</p>
<p>And let's not even get started on the sort of anomalous-yet-perfectly-normal mistakes we make every day. All those misheard words, the sounds falsely identified, illusions galore in every flavor of sense, cereal placed in the fridge, whatever. All of it.</p>
<p>You've got to wonder just how lucid we really are. The brain does its best to serve up relevant information while minimizing the noise, but we're seldom aware just how many mistakes occur or how thoroughly those mistakes are omitted from our own personal record of experiences. Obviously there's simply no reason to retain faulty information. Even the memory of such an error potentially reduces the validity of what we prefer to believe accurate at all times. The most vivid of dreams evaporates with such frantic haste - it almost seems to actively dodge our feeble attempts to bottle what little remains, no? In the end we're only left with the memory of the memory of the chase to retain it; never the thing itself.</p>
<p>If a vivid dream - something that is sometimes as rich and meaningful as our waking life - is able to evade our active pursuit then what can be said about the tiny blips and bloops of minor errors that occur in our daily lives? How many times per day are we revising reality in real time? Per moment?</p>
<p>The truth is, I suspect, that we are in constant conflict with our own deep neurological infrastructure. The majority of our true existence is so far beyond our conscious awareness (and especially conscious access) that we've simply learned to auto-rationalize behaviors done even when the intent for those behaviors was lacking entirely. A vast majority of what we call our lives is a never ending series of subconscious &quot;I meant to do that!&quot; moments. The glitches of sense and perception mentioned above are simply the manifestations of that deepest part of our not-selves failing to cover up the glitches before we can make note of them. And even when we do notice... we shrug and move on. To admit that our rich and meaningful lives are just a never ending 'best guess' extrapolation is counterproductive towards our survival. We take it on faith because objectivity is way too fucking slow for chasing prey or running away from a rock slide.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My take on it is not goal to achieve rather than reward to get.
Everything we do is mostly reward sought out for.</p>
<p>Each reward giving activity releases feel-good chemicals.(dopa endo ser etc)
We Modern humans, are &quot;junkies&quot; to that release and to all the manufactured activities that can substitute real emotion.
Even the sound of fb notification isn't randomly chosen.
Your feel good chemicals get a small/big spike each time you open your phone /play a game /masturbate /eat fancy shitfood etc etc.
And we grew into a state of ever looking for quick fixes/rewards to get on and get by, hence the opening of the fridge or the phone with no real intent..</p>
<p>My take on the matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
