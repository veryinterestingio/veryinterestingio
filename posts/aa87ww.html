<p>My guess is that the sun loses much of its influence on the daily weather cycles, and that wind and sea currents become more influential.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As close to the poles as these places are, “day” and “night” are rather meaningless - at McMurdo Sound it’s currently perpetual daylight and at Svalbard the sun doesn’t rise for a few months.  Basically it’s weather and local topography which matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Further poleward the diurnal solar cycle is less important.  There are a couple of linked effects.</p>
<p>There is less solar energy overall overall so less absolute day/night difference.  The sun is at lower angles so there is less incident energy per unit of surface and more attenuation due to a longer path through the atmosphere.</p>
<p>There is proportionally less difference in insolation between day and night.  The extreme case is where the sun is above/below the horizon most or all  the day in summer/winter.  Obviously if don't see the Sun all day it is out of the temperature equation.</p>
<p>In polar conditions other meteorological effects (winds, air mass temperature, vertical mixing, etc) will have more impact on temperature. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The general idea is that the further north you go the colder it gets.  This is like saying the average sunlight reaching the earth is reduced at more northern latitudes.  This is all correct but it is not the only influence on temperature.  Bodies of land, water, ice, all heat up and cool off at different rates.  Cloud cover can effect these rates.  The cold/warm air masses that form over these bodies can also migrate.  All of these factors combined means that the temperature can easily drop 20 degrees as the day comes and rise 20 degrees as night falls.  The cold at night and warm at day thing convention is just an average.  Over all anything can happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
