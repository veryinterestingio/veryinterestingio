		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the three lightest elements (hydrogen, helium, and lithium) are what we call &quot;primordial&quot;. That is to say that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis" target="_blank">they formed along with the universe</a> and most of the atoms of those elements are from that time (though some, like some H4 nuclei which some radioactive atoms release when they decay, can also be formed from other processes).</p>
<p>Elements up to Iron were mostly formed by what we call &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_nucleosynthesis" target="_blank">stellar nucleosynthesis</a>&quot;, which are normal fusion reactions in stars. In order to get all the way up to iron by fusion, though, you need a big star. Our sun is too small to fuse anything heavier than helium together (creating carbon in the triple-alpha process, thanks u/Cecil_FF4)! Fortunately for us, the bigger the star the shorter the lifetime, so there's been lots of time for big stars to build lots of heavier elements and die, blasting some of them into space for them to become part of our solar system.</p>
<p>Heavier elements still are created by more violent and energetic things that happen in space. When very large stars die, they undergo a massive explosion called a &quot;supernova&quot;. A supernova is vastly more powerful than anything we can imagine, and a large star so dying may release as much energy in a second or two as our sun will release in <em>billions of years</em>, and when they do so <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova_nucleosynthesis" target="_blank">they create huge amounts of all sorts of atoms, much of which is then blasted into space</a>.</p>
<p>Other high-energy events can also create lots of certain elements. For example, two neutron stars (the remnants of dead large stars) merging creates a <em>lot</em> of gold and blasts it out into space, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3960" target="_blank">it appears that much (perhaps even most) of our gold was made in such a merger</a>.</p>
<p>There are some other ways certain atoms can be made. One of the most common is if they are part of the chain of atoms that is made when a radioactive atom decays. Others are made when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogenic_nuclide" target="_blank">atoms in deep space (or even in our atmosphere) are struck by other fast-moving particles, which can change them into different atoms</a>. Sometimes rare reactions occur inside the earth, which can make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutonium#Occurrence" target="_blank">traces of some rare, shorter-lived radioactive atoms</a>.</p>
<p>All these big explosions and fast-moving particles not only create every possible combination of protons and neutrons but also mix and swirl up the gasses and dusts that are floating around in space, so that by the time the earth formed, almost ten billion years after the universe did, at least some of pretty much every atom that could be present was.</p>
<p>TL;DR: All kinds of crazy, high-energy stuff is going on in space. After billions of years of that, just about every type of atom that can be created is and then is all mixed up in the cloud that became the solar system!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The current theory of how earth was created was billions of years ago some stars exploded and threw dust everywhere. The extreme energy in this explosion combined atoms into larger elements, and it would make every element including unstable ones. As the dust combined and settled into our solar system all those different elements landed on earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So a lot of people are saying that elements on earth were made in the explosion of a star, and they're kind of correct. Data actually suggests that most elements here on earth were born in the collision neutron stars.</p>
<p>There is a PBS spacetime episode explaining how they know, and it has to do with the specific isotopes that would be created. There are processes involving the heat and pressures that are created in the event, and how they would form those specific isotopes, vs a standard supernova or other event.</p>
<p>Almost all elements are capable of being created in these events. The unstable ones decay, the stable ones also decay, but stick around longer. Scientists can estimate the abundance of the unstable elements that used to be in the system based off the material left behind that it has decayed in to.</p>
<p>As for unknown particles, the standard model of particles physics has been -very- good at predicting elements, including unstable ones. We didn't always know as much as we do now, and using the standard model, particles were predicted that were later confirmed through experimentation to actually exist. It's this combination of theory and actual experiment that allows scientists to understand whether they're on the right track, or not, and contrary to what someone might think, most scientists get more excited about a result that does NOT fit the standard model than a result that DOES. To them it means there's possibly a piece missing that can be ferretted out.</p>
<p>Problem is, these days missing pieces are so small, it's getting harder and harder to design experiments to figure them out, but it IS being done, one of the latest I'm aware of being the Muon G-2 experiment</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All of the elements we find on Earth were created by the star that preceded our sun, either during its life time, or when it went nova. Those elements were then scattered pretty much uniformly throughout our solar system, which then coalesced to form our sun, the planets, and the other celestial objects of our solar system.</p>
<p>Since there wasn't anything that would exclude any elements, the Earth would naturally contain some amount of all of them (at least those that were stable or have a significant half-life).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
