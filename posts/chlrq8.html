		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Barcodes are actually just a font what represent the numbers that are normally printed just below it. The most common type of barcode in North America is the UPC (Universal Product Code) that is owned and managed by GS1. GS1 officially licenses barcodes for products for sale, using a system where the first N numbers of the code represent the manufacturer of the product, and the rest represent the product from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>By sticking to this system, and making sure that their barcodes use the correct manufacturer number, they can know they wont be overlapping with another manufacturer.</p>
<p>Manufacturers can also pay more to get a shorter manufacturer code, so that they can have more digits left over to have more products.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Barcodes also don't necessarily have to refer back to any sort of master list, or anything. Many are just used for internal tracking, so they don't NEED to all be unique. For example, one company offers an office furniture tracking system platform (software and hardware). Every one of their customers could all have barcodes/UPCs that start with 0-00000-00001-0 and go up from there, and it wouldn't matter. The code itself doesn't have any information in it. It's just an identifier to a specific item in a database.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: They are not.</p>
<p>Barcode is just a way to encode data, and what data you encode is up to you. There are some global systems that allow you to identify a country and manufacturer of products though.</p>
<p>But even them usually just refer to product type/batch, not every individual product (so for example all bottles of coke from one shift in one plant will get same barcode).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>PS. For coca cola one batch can be milions of cans. But the batching happens, that's why sometimes the barcodes &quot;don't scan&quot; when the new batch of products come into a store.  </p>
<p>Sometimes there's a promotion, that would get a new barcode.</p>
<p>Often different retailers (big ones like Target, Wallmart), will get their own barcode for a given product.</p>
<p>Different sizes of items will obviously also get different barcodes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
