	<title>ELI5 why do most places like the DMV, Post Office, The Bank, etc are only open during the week?, giving that most people work during the week from 9 to 5 and can’t go without taking a day off, wouldn’t it make more sense for this places to also be open during weekends or close late during the week?</title>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because a majority of <em>businesses</em> are only open during the week. Banks and post offices get most of their income from business clients, not from average people. So let their hours reflect the hours of their target customers: businesses.</p>
<p>A bank doesn't care much about your aunt who has $5k in savings and deposits monthly pension checks. A bank cares a lot more about XYZ Financial who do weekly $100k transactions through that bank. XYZ Financial is only open M-F so the bank has no reason to be open over the weekend.</p>
<p>Same with the post office (even though they are open on Saturday): a large chunk of their money comes from businesses doing mass-mailing: paychecks, communications, etc. These businesses do all of their shipping and sending during normal business hours, so the post office is open during normal business hours. The only people who would be sending stuff in the middle of the night would be average people buying 40¢ stamps, not businesses buying thousands of envelopes in bulk.</p>
<p>So these services exist mostly because of their larger clients. They operate for the average person, sure, but you and me are mostly afterthoughts. It's not worth keeping hundreds of offices open over the weekend for little tiny transactions when the vast majority of transactions happen during the week during business hours</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Employees at those places also want to work their 9 to 5 job and then go home.  To get employees to cover extended hours, those employers would have to pay extra.  The reason that plumbers charge for after-hours &quot;emergency&quot; work isn't because they're trying to &quot;gouge&quot; you -- they want to go home and it costs more to convince them not to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
