		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The point of an airlock is to allow safe transit between air pressure between two different environments. i.e. between a vacuum and normal earth air pressure.</p>
<p>This works by having two airtight doors both leading into the same pressure vessel (sealed room). Outside one of the two doors is low pressure, outside the other is high. To transit from one to the other you follow this process:</p>
<ul>
<li>equalise the pressure to one side (e.g. low/vacuum)</li>
<li>open the door on that side</li>
<li>enter that door</li>
<li>close that door </li>
<li>equalise the pressure to the other side (e.g. normal earth air pressure)</li>
<li>open the other door</li>
<li>exit the chamber</li>
</ul>
<p>In a sub, there's only really a few ways to get out 'normally' and they aren't airlocks. They're watertight hatches that lead to the deck. Once submerged you are not really supposed to be able to get in or out easily. Internal doors are watertight, and again are not airlocks.</p>
<p>In an emergency it's possible to use the torpedo tubes as emergency evacuation airlocks but that's dangerous as hell and nobody wants to go through that unless they really really really have to.</p>
<p>One place I know that there are internal airlocks is on nuclear subs. There tends to be an airlock to access the reactor.</p>
<p>There are more exceptions, so I know there are subs with airlocks for divers to exit/enter, but these - as I understand it - are an exception rather than the norm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone is talking about just opening the door and the water comes in for a submarine. My understanding is that rush of water would be too great and could cause harm/damage to the person/thing waiting to exit. The same pump that gets water out probably also lets water back in to fill the room so the door can be opened without the violent rush in. </p>
<p>I’d also assume the same for space stations. </p>
<p>You want to equalize the pressure before making any attempt to open the door to exit/enter submarine and space station.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are essentially just airtight doors. However, the airlocks in space are very different from submarine airlocks. Usually there are two doors and a room between them. In a submarine, the doors open outwards (towards the sea) and in space it’s the other way around. This is because they want to use the pressure to their advantage. In a submarine, the water presses hard agains the door, so if we make the door open outwards, the pressure will keep the door shut. In space, the air inside the spaceship wants to get out, so the pressure is directed outwards. This means the doors open inwards, so, again, the pressure keeps the door shut. The two door system is to allow an astronaut or diver to get out without the whole spacecraft turning into a vacuum or the submarine flooding. </p>
<p>Let’s take the astronaut for an example. Imagine an astronaut at the ISS wants to go walk his dog. If they just opened the door, all the air would be sucked out of the spacecraft. So what they do is have two doors. Here’s the process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Both doors are shut</li>
<li>Air is pumped into the space between them. </li>
<li>The inner door opens. </li>
<li>Astronaut + dog go into the space between the doors.</li>
<li>Inner door closes. </li>
<li>Astronaut + dog suit up</li>
<li>Outer door opens.</li>
<li>Astronaut and dog go for walk</li>
<li>They enter the airlock.</li>
<li>The outer door closes. Inner door is still shut.</li>
<li>Air is pumped into the space.</li>
<li>The inner door opens.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think one of the better ways to think about it is a version of a lock-and-dam.  If you opened up all at once, you would have a major issue.  So, you isolate part of it, change it from water to no water via a pump, and then you are good.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
