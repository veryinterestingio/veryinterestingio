		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Consistency and light/noise/temp matter more than exact time of day</p>
<p>If you are in a normal shared home apt you will have to contend with both daylight and noise from outside your bedroom. Both will fuck with your sleep if you always try to sleep just before dawn.</p>
<p>But if you work the late shift and you have a quiet property and you buy blackout curtains and use HVAC to have a nice cool room? Then you can trick your body into thinking itâ€™s night. </p>
<p>Consistency is the big thing. Go to sleep the same time, sleep enough hours. Keep the schedule on your off days. Will make it much easier to keep that circadian rhythm.</p>
<p>As an adult I figured this out. I used to stay up late and sleep in on weekends as a kid and always felt shitty for it. Now i sleep every night early as if i was going to work. On days off i wake up alert and refreshed and i have my whole day ahead of me!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>First, what people are saying about sleeping outside of your circadian rhythm is true. Your body has a sleep cycle it likes to adhere to, you can sleep outside of it, but it's almost always significantly worse in quality. </p>
<p>However, what most of people are claiming to affect circadian rhythm is actually pretty shallow research. Certain things seem to be more important than others, like exposure to daylight; but the problem is that there isn't one overarching indicator. People just respond to too many different variables in too many different ways to have a completely successful measure on it. What causes your own circadian rhythm isn't always so simple. There are a lot of other environmental factors that can outweigh light cycles and such.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another poster was spot-on with their comment on light cycles. I can shed some more light on why light cycles matter.</p>
<p>The amount of time you spend sleeping may be the same in both scenarios (going to bed early and going to bed late) but the quality of the sleep might be different. When you sleep, you go through several stages of sleep, each one with different levels of brain activity and different types of brain waves (basically different speeds of electric currents between your neurons - the cells in your brain). Each of these stages are important, especially those associated with deeper sleep, and especially REM (the last stage of the cycle). You cycle through these phases, going up and down from lighter to deeper sleep and back again, while you sleep. </p>
<p>Eight hours is sleep is a guideline, because that is how long it takes for the average person to achieve the necessary number of REM cycles. Some people might need more and some people might need less to achieve the same number of cycles, which is one reason that some people do better on short sleep than others.</p>
<p>The thing about light (whether it's natural outdoor light or blue light from computer screens and phones), is that it activates certain cells in your brain, which then produce certain chemicals that help you feel alert and stay awake. When it gets dark, and your brain stops getting activated to produce those chemicals, it instead produces other chemicals, which help you get sleepy. </p>
<p>Even when you're asleep, your brain can produce these &quot;alert chemicals&quot; in response to light, and it can prevent you from properly cycling through the stages of sleep, and it can prevent you from entering the important, deep-sleep phases at all. So, although you slept eight hours, your sleep wasn't as good as it would have been in the dark. </p>
<p>Even if you have blackout curtains and an eye mask to block the light when you sleep, you may have problems with your cycle of sleepiness/alertness, since you're not getting as many hours of light exposure once you wake as you would if you did most of your sleeping when it was dark outside and most of your waking when it was light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It can often be much harder to get good sleep if you are sleeping late because your body's natural rhythm is adjusted by the daylight. Even when you sleep the light leaking into your room will adjust your body's natural day and night cycle making you more tired earlier in the evening and making you more awake in the morning. So you get much better sleep if most of you sleep takes place at night when the sun is down. Similarly you should also avoid bright artificial lights in the evening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
