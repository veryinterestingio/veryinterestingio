		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vegas has the sharpest minds coming up with the best statistical models that cover every facet of every single event that occurs in competition.</p>
<p>Even with that, it's all about getting money to be as 50/50 as possible. Sportsbooks earn on the juice. If one side is getting too much action, they will hedge by revising the odds to incentivize bettors to drop money on the other side. </p>
<p>Accurately forecasting the probability of potential outcomes isn't even close to as important as getting money to come in 50/50.</p>
<p>You can make a living (or at least a nice side income) as a sports bettor if you can come up with a model that <em>can</em> somewhat accurate predict probabilities and use that to take advantage of inefficient lines (which 100% do exist because vegas isn't trying to predict outcomes but get 50/50 action).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>i worked as a bookmakers clerk at one point for about 10 years,so it was actually on course at various race meetings,first the starting price was worked out day or two before the meeting,then say 20 mins before the race an average would be put out on the network and we would put this price up,from then we could change the price depending on how much money we where holding and stood to lose,ie turn the price down if we took a big bet,turn it up if we wanted to take more,also if we stood to lose we would back the runner ourselves.this was done instantly as we always had everything laid out on the screen and can see all bets and totals across the field in real time</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s a great book: <em>The Odds: Three Gamblers, One Season, And the Death of Their Las Vegas</em> by Chad Millman. It covers quite a bit about sports betting, odds making, setting the line, etc. It’s a few years old, now. The Stardust is gone. But the story is fascinating, and it gives some insight into the way bookmakers think, and work with data to set the line to attract as many bets as possible, and balance the book. I really enjoyed reading it, and think it would definitely answer your question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former sell side derivatives trader and data scientist here. There are two basic methods of calculating odds.</p>
<p>One is to build a statistical model and then tune the parameters of your model to match your data. Your model can then be used to calculate to probability of some other event. Sometimes this is done purely with pen and paper. Sometimes you will use random number generators to simulate a hard to calculate event many times and learn the probability distribution that way. Card games are a good example of this approach. Since you can calculate the exact probabilities based on the size of the deck you're using, what cards have been dealt etc bookmakers can use computers to calculate the odds that each player will win. </p>
<p>The second way is to rely on the &quot;market&quot;. The idea being that when large numbers of people bet on a specific event their behavior gives a good indication of the probability that something will or won't happen. For example say I'm selling tickets for a game where you win a dollar if a coin comes up heads. Well you should observe that people are indifferent to buying or selling a ticket to play if it's trading for $0.50. This works best when a market is two sided. Meaning people can buy AND sell a contract (a bet) since the price can be pushed up and down freely depending on the market consensus. Another example is the price of a stock. Stocks are actually extremely hard to value mathematically. But if you look at real world data you'll see that on average it's pretty hard to consistantly win by picking stocks. This is because the market usually converges to roughly the fair price (expected value) of the stock in the future.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a coin toss, which is a 50/50 bet, a bookies won't give you even odds.  Instead the odds are weighted slightly towards the bookies.</p>
<p>If you were to place a bet of 1 on a coin toss and you win the bookie would give you 1.9 back, say.  Not 2.  So when you win, you win 0.90, and when you lose you lose 1.  So the bookie stands to gain 0.10 for every 2 coin tosses on average.</p>
<p>Similarly with odds on sports.  The bookie has computer models that are primed with information about the particular event -- which teams, which players, past scores, info on players stats, etc etc.  The computers can work though simulations of the sports every time something happens (goal scored, for example) and adjust the odds, taking into account the margin for the bookie.</p>
<p>Source: I work for a bookies looking after the systems that run these models.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
