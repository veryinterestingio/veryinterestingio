		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The two technologies had different arcs -</p>
<p>Music streaming started with a bunch of small or single-label services, but people didn't want their music that way. Spotify managed to get all labels on board by exploiting a loophole in publishing law that let labels screw artists over and <em>viola</em>. Competition basically doesn't exist because people (generally) consume music quite passively and are used to having everything they want in one place.</p>
<p>TV and movie streaming went the other way, there was a questionmark over the tech capabilities and general demand until Netflix broadened out their DVD subscription service (they used to post DVDs) into an online service building from an existing customer base. Now everyone wants to be Netflix, difference is that many providers now are the actual content makers, meaning that believe they can build a subscription base around whatever their flagship shows are. Yet to see who will survive though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difference is the value of exclusivity. If you have Spotify but an artist you like isn’t there you are unlikely to add a second music service. Maybe you buy there album on iTunes or something or you listen some other way.</p>
<p>If you want to watch “game of thrones” or “house of cards” or “the expanse” you are much more likely to add another service. </p>
<p>It’s possible to watch Netflix for hours a day and always have new content but if there’s a particular show you want you just gotta have it. Most people don’t listen to music the same way. They put it on shuffle and listen for hours in the back ground and are not fussed about particular songs. </p>
<p>For a movie streaming service there is value in being exclusive. They will pay extra to be the only service with streaming rights to a movie/show. For music there is value for the artist to have access to the streaming service. If a musician refuses to allow streaming on a service it’s likely they will lose relevance rather than gain sales some other place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cost of a movie is more than a whole song album. Its cheaper to buy 10 songs than one movie.</p>
<p>Also most songs are paid on play. Means, only when you play the song the artist get royalty.</p>
<p>Movies are sold to platforms for a huge price . Some movies can also become exclusive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the big reasons for this is YouTube and also oiracy. The majority of popular music is still available for free on the platform. So when a streaming service tries to get more subscribers for their platform by getting exclusive content, it doesn't really make people want to switch. </p>
<p>Tidal tried this with Jay-Z and Beyonce's catalogue. Apple tried with Frank Ocean. Taylor Swift's catalogue wasn't on Spotify for years. </p>
<p>But let's say you have a Spotify account - you have all the music in the world except one artist. If you really want to listen to that artist, it's so easy - whether on YouTube or another free platform, or simply pirating it. The film / TV industry have done a much better job at preventing sites where you can watch content for free</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
