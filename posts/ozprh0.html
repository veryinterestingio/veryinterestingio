		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain senses danger based on your past experiences when someone has said that they needed to talk to you. Your brain in an instant deciphers the situation, tone of voice, facial expressions and body language and puts it all together to form a response that it thinks is crucial to your survival. </p>
<p>On a physiological level, it communicates with with your adrenal glands via neurotransmitters which stimulate the gland into releasing the hormone Epinephrine, preparing you to face the conversation head on, run away, or freeze.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what others are saying, there's another angle. Saying &quot;we need to talk&quot; implies a kind of power asymmetry. It can be as simple as the other person knowing something important that you don't (e.g., friend with important news), to someone with a type of social or moral advantage (e.g., you said or did something transgressive), or as serious as them having the power to make you listen whether you want to or not (e.g., a boss who can punish you). For anxious people, like OP and myself, our reaction is typically as if every such situation was on the more serious end of the spectrum, because that's what anxiety is... it is a state of heightened readiness to react to possible negative outcomes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
