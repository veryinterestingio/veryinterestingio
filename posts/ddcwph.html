		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A country you mean?</p>
<p>Into and out of every country there are surprisingly only a few high bandwidth fiber optic cables. These are used for everything: phone, cell/wireless, internet data you name it (everything gets converted to IP packet switched behind the scenes nowadays anyway). These lines and the junction point/switches and routers where they break out into smaller connections to go the last mile to your house or work are consolidated in one or two data centers at the telcos in your country. Not only that, but usually just one or two telcos actually went and laid the cables, the others in your country just lease bandwidth from those. </p>
<p>So when President Junta decides to cut off Facebook because the Rebels posted a picture of him having sexual relations with a burro, the head of the police just has to call one or two telcos and say &quot;Cut off the internet or we cut off your head.&quot;... from there, the folks in the network operations center really just have to click a few clicks to disable the links with the outside world.</p>
<p>Example: this is the <a href="https://www.submarinecablemap.com/#/" target="_blank">worldwide submarine cable map.</a> These are the fiber optic cables that run along the sea floor and connect countries via the oceans. Zoom in - quite a few countries are only connected to one, or two of these massive internet backbone/telecommunications cables. Literally if you were to know where to look, there'd be a thickly sheilded cable running up out of the ocean and up the beach to a little shack with a bunch of network gear in it (its a little more complicated than that, but not by much.)... There are terrestrial and satellite links too, but the principal is the same: its expensive to set these international internet/telecom cables up, so they're done surprisingly infrequently. Thanks to the wonder of switched internet packet protocols, if one link goes down (some idiot with a back-hoe), traffic will re-route to another available connection, but its always possible to disconnect an entire country's set of internet connections.</p>
<p>edit: and by disable links, usually nothing gets unplugged. All you have to do is disable the routing protocols that allow data traffic to flow in/out of the country.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>for how decentralised internet is to the end user, it is surprisingly held up by only a few cables. no point in building more. hence, you can cut off access quick and easy if you have the resources of a major world government.</p>
<p>i don't know how exactly the ban you are inferring to happened or what it was, but i know that most UK bans on websites (thepiratebay.org etc.) are just mandates from the government to local DNS services (and ones big enough that they have to bend over backwards) to stop properly indexing said bad websites. they're insanely easy to circumvent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Internet traffic is more like myriads of children running along the paths and through the gates, not like the freely flowing water in the river.</p>
<p>You just close the gates and kids stay in, and no kids from the other side can get through either.</p>
<p>Sure, it's much more nuanced than that, but ELI5 it's like this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every communication on the internet from point A to point B goes through several nodes before reaching its destination.
The path (in term of nodes to traverse) to use is decided by algorithms called Routing algorithms.
A governments can decide to tweak these routing algorithms on every node of the internet residing on its territory (i.e. nodes used by its citizens) to make any destination on the internet unreachable (or limit the capability of its nodes to allow only national websites)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
