		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So as an overall addendum to some of the comments here. Yes rotation obviously plays an enormous role in causing the dipole to be aligned with the rotation axis of the planet, however that is not the entire story. We have two examples of this in our solar system! Uranus and Neptune both have very non-dipolar, non-axisymmetric magnetic fields, despite the fact that they both rotate quite quickly.   </p>
<p>While the exact cause hasn't been definitively pinned down, the best bets are either some interesting stably stratified layers within the planets (dynamo models run by Sabine Stanley argue this) or the fact that rotation might not be dominant at the scale of magnetic field generation (called the Local Rossby Number, proposed by Uli Christensen)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>That being said, rotation is absolutely crucial to magnetic field generation in planets, it is very hard to organize flow at a large scale without it. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>tldr: Magnetic fields in planets are very complicated, rotation will always play a crucial role but a rotating planet doesn't mean you get a dipolar magnetic field.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In principle there is no real requirement for the magnetic field to be aligned at all with the rotation axis. It would however be expected due to the rotation of the planet producing Taylor columns inside the outer core resulting in a helicity component of the fluid flow roughly aligned with the rotation axis. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly the north pole is actually a South pole, magnetically speaking - magnetic fields point towards it.  The north pole of your compass needle is attracted to the south pole of the planet and therefore points north!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While Magnetic North can vary from True North, paleomagnetic evidence suggests that it does appear to approximate True North over time. This is likely due to the rotational forces that give rise to the field itself. It’s worth noting that the Geocentric Axial Dipole hypothesis is difficult to prove throughout the older portions of Earth’s history where we no longer have oceanic crust to allow for well constrained plate reconstructions (&gt;200 Ma). There may be times where the field was non-dipole in nature. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
