<p>Yes, C-14 dating can be used on objects submerged in water. However, it's not as simple as just drying the material out. And there are some significant considerations.</p>
<p>C-14 dating relies on the theory that the amount of carbon-14 that an organism takes in through metabolic processes is approximately the same as <em>atmospheric</em> carbon-14 during that organism's life. At death, the incorporation of C-14 into the organism's tissues ceases, and the existing amount begins to decay. C-14's measured half life is 5730 years, so within that time, roughly 50% of the C-14 in the dead organism's tissues is expected to have decayed to N-14.</p>
<p>The proportions of C-14 to C-12 and C-13 are tiny-- roughly 1 C-14 atom for every 1.3 trillion C-12 / C-13 atoms.</p>
<p>C-14 dating relies on this information, along with some fairly complex calculations, to arrive at an estimate for &quot;time since death,&quot; which amounts to an estimate of the number of half-lives elapsed since the organism's death.</p>
<p>But C-14 dating is based around the idea of atmospheric carbon-14. And the problem is that there are potentially <em>other</em> sources of carbon-14 that could get in the way. This is especially problematic with aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Bodies of water dissolve underlying geologic strata, and those strata can include ancient C-14. It may not amount to much at all, but it <em>can</em> throw off measurements. In organisms that live in aquatic environments, or are otherwise part of the food chain and incorporate organisms from aquatic environments, the amount of radiocarbon can be reduced in the metabolic process by taking in older (more decayed) carbon in greater proportions than an organism would if it were only taking in atmospheric carbon. The result is that an aquatic organism-- or a terrestrial organism that eats a lot of aquatic organisms-- can <em>look</em> older than it actually is. (Yes, this could potentially extend to human remains if the diet were sufficiently based around aquatic organisms.)</p>
<p>This is referred to as the <em>reservoir effect</em> and the best way to correct for it is to obtain materials of terrestrial and aquatic origin from the same archaeological contexts (i.e., hickory nutshell [terrestrial] and oyster shell [aquatic]) and date as many of each as possible. Then compare the results. The difference is known as the Delta-R, and is a correction applied to aquatic materials radiocarbon dated in a particular location. Delta-R varies from region to region, so has to be locally established.</p>
<p>So, an organism that incorporates aquatic carbon into itself as part of its metabolic processes may exhibit the reservoir effect.</p>
<p>But that's not really what you're talking about. You're talking about wood that's been submerged in water.</p>
<p>Ideally, this should not be a problem. The process of radiocarbon dating involves purification of the sample by a variety of both sampling (mechanical) and chemical processes designed to remove any contaminants (humic acids, finger oils, varnishes applied to specimens in old museum collections, cigarette ash, etc.). The material is then combusted to eliminate other organic materials except carbon, and then the sample is analyzed.</p>
<p>The purification process should ideally remove any contaminants introduced to the wood through its submersion.</p>
<p>However, it <em>is</em> possible for submersion / saturation to have an effect. If water is especially hard-- containing large amounts of minerals in solution, including calcium or magnesium carbonates-- these materials may permeate a wood sample sufficiently that you could find yourself dealing with a reservoir effect. <a href="https://heritagesciencejournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/2050-7445-1-24" target="_blank">This has been noted in some regions</a> and can be difficult to compensate for.</p>
<p>The long and the short of it is that if someone were dating submerged wooden artifacts with radiocarbon, the prudent course of action would be to obtain as many dates as possible, to sample multiple locations of the source material, and to recover samples from as deep within the material (so as to access the least affected portion of the material) as possible.</p>
<p>Such precautions would stand a much better chance of obtaining a reliable set of dates that could be used to estimate the overall age of the artifact or site in question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, carbon dating works because there is a mixture of stable and radioactive isotopes in the air. Living things are constantly recycling the carbon in their body with the environment and the ratio of carbon types stays in equilibrium while they are alive. When they die, the recycling stops and the radioactive isotopes just decay without being replaced. </p>
<p>If you measure the ratio left today, you can make a good guess at how long ago the thing died. However, this includes a number of assumptions. The biggest assumption is that the carbon ratio in the air tens of thousands of years ago when the thing died was the same as it is today.</p>
<p>As to your question about submerging in water, that should not make a big difference. The water would likely lead to some chemical reactions, but both types of carbon behave exactly the same from a chemistry perspective. So anything that happens to one happens equally to the other and the ratios of each type remains the same. Remember it is the ratio that is important to the carbon dating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
