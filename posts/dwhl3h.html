<p>The Government introduced a <del>psychology-based</del>  face heat loss standard two decades ago, and it appears that the model has some flaws.

<p>EDIT: I must have confused this study with a different one <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/1520-0477-32.10.371?mobileUi=0" target="_blank">conducted in the 1950s</a>. Here is the final report from the study: <a href="http://solberg.snr.missouri.edu/gcc/OFCMWindchillReport.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="http://solberg.snr.missouri.edu/gcc/OFCMWindchillReport.pdf" target="_blank">http://solberg.snr.missouri.edu/gcc/OFCMWindchillReport.pdf</a></a> . A</p>
<ul>
<li>It uses wind speed calculated at the average height of the human face (about 1.5 metres) instead of the standard anemometer height of 10 metres. The correction is effected by multiplying the 10-metre value (what is indicated in weather observations) by a factor of 2/3.</li>
<li>It is based on a model of the human face, and incorporates modern heat transfer theory, that is, the theory of how much heat is lost by the body to its surroundings during cold and windy days.</li>
<li>It uses a calm wind threshold of 4.8 km/h; this value has been obtained by observing the speed at which people walk at intersections.</li>
<li>It uses a consistent standard for skin tissue resistance to heat loss.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the testimony of one participant in the study: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060614202836/http://www.msc-smc.ec.gc.ca/education/windchill/personal_account_e.cfm" target="_blank"><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060614202836/http://www.msc-smc.ec.gc.ca/education/windchill/personal\_account\_e.cfm" target="_blank">http://web.archive.org/web/20060614202836/http://www.msc-smc.ec.gc.ca/education/windchill/personal\_account\_e.cfm</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is actually a wind chill formula that is typically used (it's different depending on where in the world you are, there is no standard).</p>
<p>In the United States we have one</p>
<p>T= 35.74 + .6215(Ta) - 35.75 v^.16 + .4275 (Ta) v^.16</p>
<p>Where T is the final, (Ta) is the air temp (f), and v is the wind speed in mph.</p>
<p>Australia has a far more complex one, involving humidity as well as wind velocity and ambient temperature.</p>
<p>The American model only works under certain temperatures and in low humidity, the Australian one has a wider range.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit: Somehow I skipped entirely over the wind chill, which is the &quot;feels like&quot; measure you actually asked about. This response is about the heat index, which is another &quot;feels like&quot; measure. Sorry. </p>
<p>This is called the heat index, and it's a subjective attempt to combine the effects of humidity with heat. The human body's primary cooling mechanism is through evaporation of sweat, and high humidity can dramatically slow this evaporation. The result is that the same temperature that's comfortable at 50% humidity can be sweltering or even dangerously hot at 90% or 100% humidity. The goal of the heat-index scale is to approximate, for a given temperature and humidity, how hot you would feel at &quot;normal&quot; humidity.  Accurate scales try to take into account many other variables, such as how much heat is lost from your body via respiration and direct thermal radiation. </p>
<p>For example, if it's 90 degrees F outside and &quot;normal&quot; humidity then the scale should say it &quot;feels like&quot; 90 degrees F. If it's 90 degrees F out and it's 70% humidity then <a href="https://www.weather.gov/safety/heat-index" target="_blank">NOAA says</a> it &quot;feels like&quot; 105 degrees F.</p>
<p>The key observation is that we want to estimate how fast your body loses heat. If you assume a constant heat input to your body from your metabolism, then the heat shedding rate determines your apparent temperature. If you shed heat faster then you'll reach equilibrium at a lower skin temperature and lower apparent temperature. If you shed heat slower then you'll feel hotter. </p>
<p>In a perfect world we could measure how fast your body sheds heat under various temperature and humidity conditions. However, the world is full of complications. There are tons of variables that affect how your body sheds heat, so the heat index equation makes a whole lot of assumptions in order to try and model an average person under average conditions, and then have this model be at least somewhat meaningful no matter where you are. </p>
<p>Some variables relate to the person. <a href="https://www.weather.gov/media/ffc/ta_htindx.PDF" target="_blank">NOAA's model</a> assumes you're 5 foot 7 inches tall and weigh 147 pounds- this is important as an estimate as your total body surface area, and more surface area means you can radiate heat more easily. They assume that 84% of your body is covered by clothing. They assume you're walking at a pace of 3.1 miles per hour (which governs the total heat input from your metabolism). There are many such variables, see the link above for details.</p>
<p>Then, there are variables that relate to the environment. For example, NOAA assumes a 5 knot wind.</p>
<p>All this is boiled down into a model that takes five variables in order to estimate the total heat transfer away from the body.</p>
<ol>
<li>skin resistance to heat transfer (determines how fast your body loses heat through the skin)</li>
<li>skin resistance to moisture transfer (determines how fast you sweat)</li>
<li>surface resistance to heat transfer (the surface here is the boundary layer atmosphere right outside of your body)</li>
<li>surface resistance to moisture transfer (which determines how fast water will evaporate away from your body into the larger atmosphere)</li>
<li>ventilation rate, or how much heat you lose through respiration</li>
</ol>
<p>So now we can determine whether any two weather conditions have the same &quot;apparent temperature&quot; by estimating how much heat your body loses in each condition. If your body loses the same amount of heat in conditions A and B then that means that A and B feel about the same. If your body loses more heat in A than B then A is going to feel cooler, while if your body loses less heat in A than B then A is going to feel warmer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the past, this was done with a wet-bulb thermometer.  Imagine a thermometer above a bowl of water, and a shoelace attached to the bulb such that it drops into the water and wicks the water up to the bulb.  This thermometer will register a higher or lower temperature than a normal thermometer due to the water around the bulb.  Higher if the humidity is high, lower if the humidity is low and/or the wind is blowing.  The water on the thermometer kind of acts like sweat on a person's skin, taking away heat when the weather allows it (windchill).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Love this conversation!! Up in Canada, we talk lots about windchill but I'm always frustrated by people who say &quot;windchill is gonna make it feel cold tonight... better put the car in the garage&quot;. My understanding is that inanimate objects like cars are not affected by windchill. Meaning whether they are parked inside or outside, they will only cool to the actual temperature. Is this correct?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
