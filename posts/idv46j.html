Recently there was some footage posted with an old lady making thread or something and I‚Äôve seen the footage get upscaled and colourised etc and I‚Äôm wondering how, if the footage is black and white, it can be transformed.</p>
<p>Side note:</p>
<p>Thank you all so much for your answers and comments! Also a massive thank you for my first ever award! Very much appreciated honestly üôÇ This really lends perspective on how much work people put in to colourising old videos!</p>
<p>Side note 2.0:</p>
<p>Thank you for the second award! Never thought that my curiosity would net me all this information or awards! You guys are all champs üí™üèª</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you're describing is accomplished using the magic technique of <strong>educated guessing</strong>. It's not physically possible to know what color something is certainly supposed to be simply from the data in a black and white image or video, but you can use clues related to context of each object to determine what color it should be such as uniforms from a specific period typically being one color. This guessing process can be done by humans or machines, it's ultimately the same fundamental concept of using context.</p>
<p>Our brains are fairly lazy so even if there are numerous errors in this transformation we aren't bothered by them.</p>
<p>If you're asking how technically it's possible to change a gray pixel to a colorized one, the gray tones are just mapped onto some selected shade of a color. So dark gray becomes dark red, light gray becomes light red etc within some boundary. The objects and their components are just separated by a set of boundaries which determine what color they should be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's the same concept except the experts who colorize photographs tend to do a little more research to try and get the colors and shades correct.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
