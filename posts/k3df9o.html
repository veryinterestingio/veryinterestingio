		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As u/pulpinator pointed out, it's probably due to you basically diluting one in the other. Assuming your statement to be true:</p>
<p>The sugars are further apart from each other so the honey/sauce combo gets thinner or less viscous than either component on their own. If both honey and bbq sauce have different sugars in different ratios, putting together in one delicious honey bbq sauce changes how those sugars organize and see each other.</p>
<p>My reasoning:
Relevant plot from RG. At high concentration, sucrose has highest relative viscosity followed by glucose then fructose (and honey). Since both products have different sugars, you effectively dilute them to some extent in the combo sauce, thereby lowering the viscosity.

<p>This also happens when you try to make honey mustard with regular mustard and honey. You need a thickening agent to make the mixture more &quot;saucy.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a food technologists and I've worked on a bunch of high sugar sauces.  It can be a bit of a challenge to get them thick enough.  Here's what is usually going on in a situation like this.  Honey is very high in sugar, which is one of the reasons it is thick - it is about 70% sugar by weight.  Creamed honey has a bunch of tiny crystals in it which makes it even thicker, they act like particles that interact and thicken up the mixture.  A BBQ sauce on the other hand will have some kind of thickener in it, but a relatively low total solids percentage, maybe around 15% if it also has sugar in it.  The thickener might be vegetable gums or starch, or both.  These have very long chain molecules in them that when hydrated, thicken up the water in the sauce.  The water sticks to the surface of the molecules and the molecules interact, kind of like sticky spaghetti in a pot.  When you mix the two together the water from the sauce will dilute the honey making the mix about 40-50% solids if it's a 50/50 mix.  The sugar from the honey gets between the long molecules of the starch or gum so they don't interact quite as well, kind of lubricating them, kind of like if you stir in pasta sauce to cooked spaghetti, it lets the strands of spaghetti slide against each other, so you can stir them around more freely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Firstly, honey, sauces, and most sticky liquids are &quot;thixotropic&quot; - stirring them makes them easier to stir. This will be part of the reason the mix becomes more watery.</p>
<p>As an educated guess, I think the honey is probably also getting mechanically dispersed in the bbq sauce and forming something akin to a colloid. To picture this, imagine that you mix honey with a lot of sand. Eventually the honey is just a bunch of discrete sticky droplets, all coated in sand and rolling freely over one another. (Also note that when particles in a system are the same shape, I recall the system is more viscous than when their sizes are more varied. The overall mixture of &quot;sand&quot; and &quot;honey&quot; might end up less viscous than either individually.) </p>
<p>Now, imagine molecules of liquid surrounding the honey in place of the sand - that's a colloid. </p>
<p>I've also definitely seen a demo of two viscous polymers mixing together to form a thin solution, but I don't believe the interactions involved have jack shit to do with this and i cannot find any source on it. I am so sorry to give such vague information</p>
<p>Finally I would also like to note that there should not be a chemical reaction occuring to dehydrate either of them. I'd really like to hear what kind of reactions are being proposed. Edit: For sure, though, sounds like vinegar+sugar has an impact. edit2: oh, okay, sounds like it might not? A mystery lmao</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think I may have figured it out doing a brief search of ingredients in barbecue sauce and using my limited understanding of chemistry.  Barbecue sauce often contains vinegar and vinegar dissolves sugar.  The dissolved sugar will bond with whatever water is present and this will break up hydrogen bonds holding the sauces together creating a more watery, easily dispersed solution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
