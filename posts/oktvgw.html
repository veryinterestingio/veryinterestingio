		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because of sleep-cycles. When we sleep our body does so in 90-min intervals going from almost awake to deep sleep. When you wake up naturally it is because your body is in the almost awake state and thus waking up feel gradual. When you get woken up by an alarm, you might not be in that almost awake state and but that loud noise signals danger to your body (old primal behavior) and thus rip you out of sleep and thus you feel worse</p>
<p>The math also works out too. 6 hours is 360 mins and it is divisible by 90. Which is 4 distinct sleep cycles 8 hours is 480 mins and create 5 and 1/3 sleep cycles. Being in that 1/3 and waking up is what makes you feel worse</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're ready to wake up when you wake up on your own. Your brain just finished whatever tasks it needed to do at the time, so it's ready to wake up. It finished assembling the 4th jigsaw puzzle of the night and is content. The computer was allowed to finish the update.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You're not ready when your alarm throws you out of bed. Your brain is cut off mid-task and is not happy about it. The jigsaw puzzle it was working it just got tossed into the wall and is understandably rather upset. You just hit the power button in the middle of an update when the computer specifically told you not to and now there's a bug and it wants to restart all over again to fix it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
