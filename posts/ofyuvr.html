		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They weren't 45 billion lightyears away when the light starting heading towards us. The light has only travelled 13 billion lightyears, but we can calculate the rate of expansion of the universe based on redshift, and so we know that the origin of the 13 billion year old photons reaching us is currently 45 billion lightyears away.</p>
<p>Suppose you're standing by the road, and a car drives past you. After it's, say, 10 meters past you, someone in the back seat throws a bottle out of the window in your direction. The bottle is travelling towards you at 1 m/s. After 10 seconds, the bottle reaches you, but at this point the car itself is 100 meters away. The bottle couldn't have travelled 100 meters in 10 seconds, and indeed it didn't - it only travelled 10 meters. But you can then take that bottle, and read the note inside, and learn things about the occupants of the car who now <em>are</em> 100 meters away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thing you have to keep in mind is that space isn't finite, it's expanding.</p>
<p>So the light has been traveling for 13 billion years to reach you, but in that time the distance between you and the source of that light has increased and stretched out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is due to the expansion of space. If a very distant object emitted light a long time ago, that light would have to travel across expanding space to reach us. By the time the light hits our telescope, the distance between us and the object has increased because of the expansion of space. In the circumstance you mentioned, the light has not actually travelled for 45 billion years because that clearly violates causality. It is just that the distance between us and the object that emitted the light is now 45 billion light years due to the expansion of space. But how can we determine this distance just by measuring light? This increase in distance can be detected by analysing the redshift in the light. Because of general relativity, we know that light gets redshifted as it moves through expanding space. We also know the spectra that elements emit when hot. If we analyse the pattern of  redshifted wavelengths we are seeing, we can tell which elements initially emitted this light and compare the observed wavelengths to ones that we know these elements emit. This information is plugged into the equations of general relativity to determine the actual distance between us and the object that emitted the light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stars far away from us are moving away but the space in between is also expanding. There is a certain distance away where space is expanding such that the distance is increasing faster than the speed of light. There are things that are becoming invisible and will never be visible to us ever again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
