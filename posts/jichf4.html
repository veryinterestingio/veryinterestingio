Israel hosts one of the world's leading primary research facilities in the area of medical cannabis. I was the first scientist in Israel to study the plant-based science of medical cannabis. I and my team work to advance the academic and applied science of the cannabis plant. Their objective is to develop basic and practical knowledge of secondary metabolism in health-beneficial plants, including cannabis, to contribute to human health and food security, while protecting the environment.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is there any scientific evidence that flushing plants (feeding only water or decreasing concentration of hydroponic solution) before harvest does anything useful to the final product?</p>
<p>Is there any scientific evidence that leaving plants in total darkness for \~24-72hrs prior to harvest increases cannabinoid concentrations?</p>
<p>Is there any scientific evidence behind the &quot;white ash&quot; test, in which growers seem to believe that cannabis that creates white ash is higher quality or has different mineral content?</p>
<p>Can you speak to the chemical process that is occurring when Cannabis is cured? (e.g. after drying, putting cannabis into air-tight, humidity controlled buckets to allow moisture content to become uniform).</p>
<p>Is there any evidence for supplemental UV lighting to increase cannabinoid concentrations?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a cancer patient and a medical student marijuana has been very interesting to learn about. </p>
<p>There has to be thousands of compounds in the various strains. Are there any strains or techniques (vaporizing, temperatures etc.)that have shown better anti neoplastic activity or anti-emetic activity? Not to mention every cancer can be wildly different and responds different.</p>
<p>Edit: q2: my specific cancer actually seems to upregulate cannabinoid receptors which may lead to apoptosis when stimulated. Any idea why would the cancer upregulate such a random receptor?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for doing this AMA! I am in my late 30s and was recently diagnosed with ADHD. I would consider myself a chronic THC user since my late teens. I've quit cigarettes and alcohol, but I can't seem to kick cannabis. I find it helps with boredom, and elevates my mood (most of the time). I've read  that cannabis can both be good and bad for ADHD. Do you have any knowledge to share regarding cannabis and its affects on ADHD users? I've also heard from several doctors it could just be the chronic use and not ADHD, GAD, or MDD, but I had symptoms before I began using cannabis but never recieved any treatment. I also suffer from and have a family history of migraines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
