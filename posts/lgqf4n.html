		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans evolved to have pleasurable feelings associated with activities that are good for survival (being warm, eating energy rich food, sex etc.).  There are two of these that come with petting animals: </p>
<p>1) pets (especially cats and dogs) behave in ways we interpret as affectionate, so our brain thinks &quot;this creature likes me&quot;</p>
<p>2) some aspects of pet mammals (small, soft, large heads relative to their bodies) remind us of human children, so petting an animal feels like looking after a child, another activity which is good for survival of the species so evolution selects for it.</p>
<p>What we describe as &quot;cute&quot; often essentially means &quot;resembling a human child&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think this is based on your schema of the animal in question. So some people have that reaction. They see an animal and they touch the fur and the brain releases the oxytocin because they've had a generally positive reaction with that animal over their lifetime. Some people haven't had such good experiences, and so they freak out (ie. Panic, get scared etc.) instead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans are social animals and we evolved responses to social activities like cuddling that benefit us. Two hormones play a role here in this, called oxytocin (sometimes referred to as the love hormone) and cortisol (a stress hormone). </p>
<p>Oxytocin is released in situations like romantic love (people “in love” have higher levels, thinking about or being with a romantic partner increases those levels, touch included), parent-child bonding (for example it is very strongly released in “skin-to-skin” time post-birth and breast feeding), and petting animals or cuddling in general (you can even get some of its effects cuddling yourself). </p>
<p>Oxytocin is released from the brain (the posterior pituitary, after being first created in the hypothalamus). It is part of a positive feedback loop in the body when most hormones are part of negative feedback loops. This means that more oxytocin leads to the release of even more oxytocin (rather than it causing decreasing levels). </p>
<p>Physiologically, when petting animals, oxytocin binds to receptors in the heart and blood vessels that leads to lower blood pressure and heart rate. Psychologically, it produces anti-depressant-like effects and elevates mood. </p>
<p>The other important hormone here is cortisol. Cortisol is released from the adrenal glands located in one’s abdomen/stomach and it’s release is controlled by a complex network that includes the brain (the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal cortex). It is a steroid hormone involved in the stress response, including the fight-or-flight response. Petting animals actually decreases this hormone, leading to a blunting of this stress response, decreased heart rate, decreased blood pressure, feeling more calm.</p>
<p>Basically, petting animals increases oxytocin (love hormone) and decreases cortisol (stress hormone), resulting in relaxation, elevated mood, lower blood pressure, lower heart rate, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
