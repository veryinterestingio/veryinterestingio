Which breaks the jet of a shaped charge warhead or shatters a kinetic energy penetrator. I need to know the reasons <strong>why</strong> the tumbling happens.</p>
<p>The differing densities cause acceleration and deceleration. Right? a=F/DV. Presuming volume remains constant.</p>
<p>But E=DVv2/2. So reduced density should expend less energy.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What are you referring to?  Spaced armour, composite armour or surface hardening of plate armour?</p>
<p>Spaced armour works by having an outer plate disrupt a penetrator, the fragments of which are then stopped by the inner armour.  Spaced armour can also reduce the effectiveness of HEAT rounds by causing them to detonate at the wrong distance.</p>
<p>Composite armour is made from multiple layers of different materials with different properties, which can be more effective than homogeneous armour, especially against HEAT rounds.</p>
<p>Surface hardening of plate armour gives a hard outer surface which can damage penetrating rounds, and a softer innermost layer which can resist shock and spalling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Its not just the projectile traveling into the object but around is a cone of broken particles that either absorb the impact or try to push further into the object.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not so much that there's different densities, it's more that there's a gap--can be small, but a gap. This allows the armor to crumple just a tiny bit. This increases the time it takes for the force to happen, dispersing the impact of the force. It's kind of similar to older vs newer cars--older cars were rigid, and if you got in a head on collision, the force would go mainly to the people in the car. At around the 1960's, cars were made to deform, increasing the time it takes for the collision to occur, which is much safer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I remember from my days in the military. It's because everything at those velocities acts more like a liquid than a solid.</p>
<p>I don't know if you've looked at armor after a kinetic penetrator has struck it, but it's more melted through than blasted through.</p>
<p>So less &quot;tumble&quot; and more &quot;blob over a larger surface&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
