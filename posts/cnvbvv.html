Most people do a decent job of regulating their blood sugar in the absence of food but sometimes you may become mildly hypoglycemic. Also, irritability can be a symptom of hypoglycemia (think hanger).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're referring to doing nothing but not eating, then the answers here about ketosis and hormones are correct, depending on the length of time you haven't eaten. If you're talking about the phenomenon where you're hungry, haven't eaten yet, and then you do strenuous activity (ex: running, biking, etc.) and your hunger disappears, that's due to a much simpler reason: blood. </p>
<p>Your organs need proper blood supply to operate, and that includes your gut and other digestive organs. If you haven't eaten yet and you do strenuous activity, a lot of of the blood is taken from  the gut and associated organs, as they are not currently being used, and redirected to the muscles that are being used (arms/legs). Without a strong blood supply, your gut starts to 'dry up', which is the reason why the first bite after a long exercise can make you even more nauseous, as the body is starting to wake up the gut as you've already got food sitting there not being digested. It's the reason many marathon bikers recommend taking a few small bites of something soft and wet before eating a large meal after the marathon, in order to get the blood flow back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of, your hunger is controlled by a hormone called Ghrelin. It spikes in most people 3 times per day, very closely to previous day's responses. This means that you get hunger symptoms corresponding to when you usually want to eat; breakfast, lunch and dinner.</p>
<p>If you ignore the first response, and don't eat, you won't be twice as hungry at lunch. But rather, you will be able to eat more with a weaker signal. Other hormones will also contribute to how satiated you will feel per meal, like insulin. Snacks between meals will also give out a dopamine response.</p>
<p>So together, Ghrelin and dopamine will cause you to feel empty inside. If you find yourself skipping breakfast and lunch, you will probably not be able to eat too much at this point due to enzyme activity in the stomach slowing down as it begins to contract, unless your avid overeater or do intermittent fasting which will stretch your stomach from larger meals.</p>
<p>Here are some videos on the topic if you'd like to learn more accurate information: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APZCfmgzoS0" target="_blank">video 1</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2IKmwyfg" target="_blank">video 2</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKfR6bAXr-c" target="_blank">video 3</a></p>
<p>E: I didn't mean for this to blow up, I was pointed out that I forgot to include Leptin. This hormone controls your apetite and tells your body how much energy to use.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
