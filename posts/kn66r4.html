		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pfizer already has a large number of “clean room” manufacturing facilities around the world. Moderna is using contract manufacturing facilities. Unlike traditional attenuated vaccine manufacturing like the annual flu vaccines, these vaccines use new mRNA lipid nanoparticles for vaccine delivery to the cell. This is a quicker process. There are different manufacturing limitations for both vaccines that will constrain production volume, hence the current issues about who gets the vaccines first.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Producing these vaccines will take up resources (raw materials, lab space, machines, people, ...). These resources could/would have been used for something else if covid did not happen. </p>
<p>Will this now cause shortages or issues in the production of other medical products, or is there enough capacity for both covid vaccines and 'regular' medicin?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A couple of caveats before we start. First, as you would expect a lot of the information is proprietary, meaning that the companies are being tight-lipped about the details to maintain an advantage over their competitors. Second, there are multiple vaccines, and each company is manufacturing theirs in their own way. However, the methods are likely to be similar, and for the sake of simplicity, I'm going to discuss the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine because I was able to find a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/11/17/coronavirus-vaccine-manufacturing/" target="_blank">good article verifying some of the details</a>. Third, I am only going to cover the biological component of the vaccine, the mRNA, because that's my area of expertise. I don't know jack about making the other critical component of the vaccine, the lipid nanoparticle sheath, which is what enables the mRNA to get inside the cell. Finally, I'm going to assume a basic level of knowledge about Central Dogma, (DNA =&gt; mRNA =&gt; protein) for the sake of brevity. If some of my terminology doesn't make sense, many articles online can help. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology" target="_blank">Wikipedia's seems easy to understand</a>. </p>
<p>Old timey drug manufacturing was done almost entirely through chemical synthesis- think about making aspirin in your first orgo lab (shudder). This is fine if you're making relatively simple molecules from just a handful of atoms. Nowadays, therapies are so incredibly complex, consisting of hundreds of subunits and many thousands of atoms, that making it with just chemical reactions would be impossible. Instead, we manipulate cells to do the hard work for us, in a process known as cell manufacturing. We have gotten very good at convincing cells to make exactly what we need of them, whether it's proteins (e.g. insulin, or the antibody therapies) or in the case of the COVID vaccine, mRNA.</p>
<p>Since mRNA is unstable, Pfizer starts by making the DNA complement of the sequence. To get a lot of it, they use our old reliable friend E. coli. They have methods to trick the bacteria to take the DNA inside (a process known as transfection), and then you just feed the cells and wait for them to grow! Every time the cell replicates, a process that takes only 20 minutes (!), another copy of our sequence is created. You can see that this is great for generating large-scale quantities of what we need because it's logarithmic- one cell divides to become two, then two becomes four, and soon enough you're talking about astronomical amounts. </p>
<p>Afterwards, the genetic material is isolated from the cells, which is then purified for the sequence we need. Now we've got all this DNA, and we need to convert it to RNA for the vaccine- this is a process known as reverse transcription and is cell-independent. The DNA template, along with various enzymes and building-block components, are incubated in large vats to produce the RNA (vastly oversimplifying here- a lot of the science that goes into making the vaccine is in how you add special modifications to the RNA so that human cells won't reject it). After that, it just all needs to combined with whatever else is in the vaccine (see above point 3), and you're good to go! One batch of vaccine. </p>
<p>Happy to answer any questions people have about cell manufacturing, as best I know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Biomedical engineer here. The first step in manufacturing mRNA vaccines at scale is procuring the enzymes and reagents necessary to synthesize the mRNA via transcription of plasmid DNA using RNA polymerase. Once synthesized the 5’ non structural proteins for self amplification and the 3’ ends of the mRNA are capped.  Once this is complete, a plasmid DNA template is transcribed and then that plasmid DNA is removed using DNAse.
The next step is the purification of the mRNA via sterile precipitation and extraction steps usually done chromatographically. Sterile continuous stirring bio reactors are typically used, and the sterilization protocols are rigorous. </p>
<p>Ensuring this process is done without any contamination and following the current good manufacturing practice guidelines adds an additional challenge to the manufacturing of mRNA vaccines. This is difficult in large scale processes as any trace amount of contamination will ruin the entire batch and render it useless. </p>
<p>Any other excess non linearized template DNA is also removed. This finished mRNA product is encapsulated inside lipid nanoparticles for ideal delivery of the vaccine. An aspetic processing device must be used to package bulk quantities of the vaccine into hypodermic needles under climate controlled conditions. Then storage and delivery of precise climate controlled vaccines is also a difficult and expensive undertaking. </p>
<p>In summary the greatest difficulties in large scale production is ensuring a high yield, no contamination, following all safety standards, and ensuring precise climate controlled packaging, transportation, and delivery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. They use in vitro transcription with T7 polymerase, very VERY likely by using large volume reactors (<a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.wbur.org/commonhealth/2020/12/09/pfizer-vaccine-andover-manufacturing-facility" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.wbur.org/commonhealth/2020/12/09/pfizer-vaccine-andover-manufacturing-facility</a>).</p>
<p>Definitely no machine, the RNA is way too long and the yield would be way too low.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
