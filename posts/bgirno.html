		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The saturated fats in coconut oil are in the form of “Medium-chain triglyceride (MCT)” - this basically means your body burns the saturated fats found in coconut oil in the same way it burns carbs.</p>
<p>Carbs (and the sat. fats in coconut oil) are used directly for energy rather than being stored as fat in your body. However, just like carbs, if you eat more than your body is able to burn then the excess will indeed be stored as fat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s not. It’s bro science. </p>
<p>They are ‘healthier’ than other saturated fats, but it’s still saturated fat and you should limit your consumption of them to reasonable levels. It’s like saying cane sugar soda is ‘healthier’ than HFCS soda. </p>
<p>Sure, it’s BETTER for you in some small way, but the bad outweighs the good. </p>
<p>As an aside, studies are starting to come out contesting the benefits of coconut oil. An adjunct Professor (Karin Michels) at Harvard Medical School claims coconut oil is terrible for you and the pseudo-science claiming it is healthy is a concerted disinformation campaign by the coconut industry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Coconut oil is a fad and its benefits have no scientific backing.</p>
<p>People are welcome to use it as much as they want but it would be dishonest to say it has proven benefits. There is a very limited knowledge base investigating its benefits.</p>
<p>It may be beneficial or may be harmful. There is just not enough evidence to back either claim.</p>
<p>This may not be the most sexy answer but I come from a medical background and in medicine, we have to acknowledge when we don't have the answers.</p>
<p>I'm happy to back this up with research if people are interested.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
