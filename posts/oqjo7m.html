<p>Does it just look like the light disappeared to the human eye due to it traveling so fast or will it actually disappear?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It keeps going. But the atmosphere has a lot of stuff to interfere with it, and it is so small and faint that it diffuses to basically invisibility pretty quick, so even if you had a super fast and super sensitive iphone following the beam at the speed of light, you would lose it in a really short time. But yeah, the photons keep flying away into space forever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the light you already sent out will keep going, it doesn't care if you turned the source off because it's already on it's way.<br />
Just like a bullet doesn't care it you keep holding the gun.  </p>
<p>When you turn it off you won't see it anymore, those photons are going away from you, but if someone is in that direction, like say you shined it directly at someone orbiting Mars, they'd see it a few minutes later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The previous posters are only partially correct.</p>
<p>Even assuming there is no atmosphere to disperse the laser and that the laser would not hit anything, it would still disappear.</p>
<p>The universe expands which means light travelling large distances red shifts. The light from the green laser would increase in wavelength.  It would eventually shift into red, then infrared, then into microwaves and radio waves. After billions of years it'd be indistinguishable from the cosmic microwave background.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is actually what the stars in the sky are, just that they are a lot brighter and turned on for longer than your laser. But if you have a star that is millions to billions of light years away, this star could have very well died ages ago, yet the light keeps hitting us. Once all the light that was on its way before that star died reaches us, we will no longer see it in the sky</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Until it hits something yes. In general that will be the air and that will disperse the light. The light that does make it through will just keep going until it hits something or is pulled into a gravity well. The reason this happens is the same that light from the sun can reach earth. Light travels at the speed of light (called C) when in vacuum. There are no particles to interact with and it takes a huge amount of gravity to make a noticeable effect to its direction. It’s kinda like how if you shoot a arrow in space it will just keep going as there is no air to produce drag and no gravity to pull it down. It’s not exactly the same but good enough for a surface level explanation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
