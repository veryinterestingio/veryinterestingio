		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, I'm from the US and I speak English natively. While English was different here 100 years ago, I could probably understand what was being said if I were transported there. Same with 200 years ago. Maybe even 300 years.</p>
<p>But if I were transported to England 500 years ago, could I understand what was being said? 1000 years ago? At what point was English/Old English so distinct from Modern English that it would be incomprehensible to my ears?</p>
<p>How does that number compare to that of modern Spanish, or modern French, or modern Arabic, or modern Mandarin, or modern Hindi? etc.</p>
<p>(For this thought experiment, the time traveler can be sent anywhere on Earth. If I could understand Medieval German better than Medieval English, that counts).</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Old English was the language spoken before the Norman Conquest (1066), and would be completely incomprehensible to you other than a few words that have remained, see <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43521/beowulf-old-english-version" target="_blank">Beowulf</a>. Middle English was spoken between 1066 and about 1500, and varies a lot within that time period and from region to region. Take two pieces from the late 14th century: <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cme/Gawain?rgn=main;view=fulltext" target="_blank">Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</a> which is a little better than Old English, but not really, and <a href="https://chaucer.fas.harvard.edu/pages/general-prologue-0" target="_blank">The Canterbury Tales</a> which is getting close to modern English. <em>Sir Gawain</em> was probably written in a dialect from the northern Midlands, while <em>The Canterbury Tales</em> was written in the dialect spoken in London at the time which clearly was a more direct predecessor to modern English, though it's deceptive because vowels were pronounced differently in Middle English. From the 1400s to the 1600s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Vowel_Shift" target="_blank">Great Vowel Shift</a> and a general trend towards standardized spelling swept across England, leading to the modern language. The works of Shakespeare and the King James Bible are the best examples of early modern English, though they are sometimes erroneously called &quot;old English.&quot; Of course the language continues to change but other than using a few words differently or not understanding the slang of the period/region you would understand just about anything from about 1600 on, possibly 1500 if you're in the right place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A Mandarin Chinese speaker would be able to read most of the way back to the beginning of writing (especially a person familiar with calligraphy), but unless they were familiar with the exact provincial dialect of wherever they were sent, they wouldn't understand much (or possibly any) of the spoken language. If the time traveler were from Nanjing and thus natively familiar with Nanjing Mandarin, and with approximately the same difficulty as modern Americans find in trying to talk to modern Scottish people, they might be able to communicate with a government official after Ganhua/官话 (the &quot;court language&quot;) began to be required of Imperial officials in the 1400s.</p>
<p>Putonghua (standard mandarin) as the national language is a very modern invention, dating from after the Communist takeover. Prior to that nearly everyone spoke a local dialect of a local language, and a majority of the eastern provinces spoke (and still natively speak) dialects of Chinese languages that are not Mandarin, such as Wu (which includes Shanghainese) or Yue (which includes Cantonese).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Medieval German</p>

<p>The classic text there is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibelungenlied" target="_blank">Nibelungenlied</a>, 13th century. <a href="http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/germanica/Chronologie/12Jh/Nibelungen/nib_c_10.html" target="_blank">Here is a text example</a>. Reading it as a German native speaker: Many of the common general words (things like &quot;what&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, &quot;all&quot;, ...) are similar or even identical, it is easy to recognize them. Many nouns changed, however, and many verbs in there fell out of use long ago - and these are the important parts of the sentences. Overall I don't understand much. Speaking it would probably be even more difficult. I know you can read it if you spend some time learning the main differences. </p>
<p>If we go to 1550 we have the Bible translation from Luther, <a href="http://www.zeno.org/Literatur/M/Luther,+Martin/Luther-Bibel+1545/Das+Neue+Testament/Der+Brief+des+Paulus+an+die+Epheser/Epheserbrief+5" target="_blank">here is a text example</a>. That is much easier to read already, and communication shouldn't be such a big problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Arab word experiences a high degree of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diglossia" target="_blank">diglossia</a> (in fact, the word was coined to describe the Arab world) - we're taught &quot;formal&quot; Arabic (fus7a, or Modern Standard Arabic) but we all speak vernacular regional dialects, that in most cases are mutually unintelligible for speakers from more distant regions. (For example, a Moroccan and a Lebanese likely won't unable to understand each other if they just spoke their respective vernaculars.)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If one is good at MSA, reading the Qur'an, the seminal Arabic text from \~1400y ago, is not <em>that</em> difficult in most places. The Qur'an uses more complex grammatical structures and words that have either fallen out of use or had different meanings back then, but the general gist of something should be understandable. If one isn't good at MSA and only knows the vernacular, it becomes quite hard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With regards to Hindi</p>
<p>although it's origin can be dated back to 7^(th) Century CE...it will be pretty difficult for a normal Hindi speaker to understand even something which was said 500 years ago(ignoring the fact that there are so any different dialects in Hindi).</p>
<p>Although I would like to mention that Sanskrit which is kind of like the mother language to Hindi and is one of the oldest documented language, it has remained the same...one could go back 3500 years and still will be able to converse properly in Sanskrit(assuming he knows Sanskrit properly which is not very common in present Indian society).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
