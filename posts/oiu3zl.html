		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because different languages do different things for people. Languages carry identity and preserve a people's history.</p>
<p>First, the language and dialect you learned from your parents and your community as a child shaped your identity. You have a unique voice, and it is influenced by how you learned to speak. When you speak with your parents, childhood friends, or your local folks, the dialect of your home shows you to be one of them. Dialect is useful in common identity. It's also useful in projecting the identity you want to have (or the identity you believe are expected to have). Language differences are like dialect differences, compounded over distance and time.</p>
<p>Why are languages important to have?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;With every language that dies we lose an enormous cultural heritage; the understanding of how humans relate to the world around us; scientific, medical and botanical knowledge; and most importantly, we lose the expression of communitiesâ€™ humor, love and life. In short, we lose the testimony of centuries of life.&quot; </p>
<p>-- Endangered Languages Project</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Languages have different rhythm, affecting musical rhythm. Sometimes it's useful to write lyrics in Spanish, sometimes in French, sometimes in Bengali. Languages have different emotional weight for different concepts. <strong>Languages even approach different concepts differently.</strong> Direction, concept of space, colors, and whatever's culturally salient. </p>
<p>Languages encode so much of what it means to have a perspective on the world. That diversity is irreplaceable. </p>
<p>A universal Earth language would mean a singular Earth perspective and identity. It may be plausible... but not very useful right now.  At least until there's another, Non-Earth, identity out there that we can define ourselves from.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We kind of have. The concept is called a lingua franca. Currently English has that role, and some other languages are local linguae francae in certain areas.</p>
<p>A lingua franca is only necessary as a second language. Maintaining a first language that everybody would be able to comprehend and keeping it synchronized across the world would probably be more of an effort than just learning a second language in school.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They tried, with Esperanto. No one cared enough to adopt it in large numbers.</p>
<p>The problem is getting people onboard. Why should I, an English/Spanish/Mandarin/Tamil/Quechua/Yoruba speaker, have to learn another language and abandon my own? Making everyone &quot;suffer&quot; by having to learn a new, universal language is a hard sell. And if you decide not to make a universal language and just adopt one language as universal, then all the non-speakers will feel discriminated against. Why should they have to learn another language and lose their own?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

French and Spanish also (sort of) qualify as lingua francae for certain regions of the world, although they don't have as much sway as English does at a global level.</p>
<p>There also has been an attempt at building a language to serve as a global language called Esperanto, but it's largely failed to catch on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
