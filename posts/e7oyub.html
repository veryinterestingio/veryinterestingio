		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The truth is, we really don't know for certain. It's kind of a drag really, not being able to just directly ask them. It also almost certainly varies because animals perceive the world differently based on their species. Some rely heavily on sound while others use smell as a primary sense. Do some babies smell different? Sound different? I'm sure there's some primary literature out there where researchers tried to control for the five senses and see if fathers could still recognize their offspring: coat them in a strongly-smelling substance or put them behind glass so they can't hear or smell them at all. It would be an interesting experiment. </p>
<p>Many mammals <em>can</em> definitely recognize each other just as we humans do, and there are some species where females routinely mate with multiple males. I believe the theory behind that just boils down to a female trying to trick all males in the area into thinking her kids might be theirs so they don't kill them when they run into a female they know they've mated with. Everyone wins.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not known. For horses (DK about zebras) in a herd the stallion knows if a foal is his or not, and the mare knows her foal and will reject a foal if it isn't hers, or gets aggressive with her foal.</p>
<p>It is said that after a foal is weaned from the mother and there is a time of separation, the mares and their former babies don't recognize each other.</p>
<p>There's no proof of any of that, but personal experience when a mother and grown baby are reunited after years, there doesn't seem to be recognition. The male will breed his former mother, although a mother and daughter will probably get along in pasture.</p>
<p>How zebras differ or are the same for horses in this behavior is unknow because wild zebras are hard to follow and observe for long periods of time. </p>
<p>Also, there are three types of zebras. two types are more like horses and one type is more like a wild donkey genetically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chimps have been tested by matching parents and kids pictures. Oddly enough the accuracy that chimps do this is much higher than humans. </p>
<p>Point is the ability to tell relations between parent and child may be more instinctive than cognitive. </p>
<p>It could also be as simple as the male is new to the area or is young and has never successfully mated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the animal. With land mammals, it is a lot to do with scent. A good example of this would be sheep. A sheep will reject a lamb which isn't there own, they will head butt it away, not let it suckle etc. However, if you have sheep that has just given birth, you can get it to accept an orphan lamb if you coat that lamb in the goop that's coating her own lambs before she has had a chance to clean them off. Gross but means the orphan lamb gets a new mother!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
