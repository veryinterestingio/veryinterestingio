		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You'll also need to distinguish between the total debt and the US government debt. I am assuming you mean government debt. One of the first things to understand is that government debt cannot be treated the same as personal or business debt. The rules are very different. </p>
<p>The US is in a fairly unique position for historical and other reasons. For smaller and not so creditworthy governments (high political risk, unstable economies, high social unrest etc) they may have to take loans in foreign currencies. Governments of more established economies (EU, Japan etc) probably don't. So there is nuance on what kind of debt government takes on too.</p>
<p>First, all (pretty much) US government debt is issued and paid back in USD which the US government controls. It is, in theory, possible for the US government to simply print as much USD as needed to pay off this debt. It won't do so because that will almost certainly damage or destroy the US economy. The reasons for the debt are many which require some understanding of how modern economies work. </p>
<p>Debt is the result of a transaction. There is a borrower and lender. Because the US government is seen as safe, it can ask for loans and really has no shortage of entities willing to lend to it. Some are required to (like Soc Sec) others do so because the majority of their income derives from the US economy and they accumulate USD and need a safe place to invest. </p>
<p>To cut this comment short, although the debt is high by absolute numbers, the typical measure of the debt load is to normalize it to the size of the economy. The US economy is huge so the debt/GDP ratio of the US government, while high by historic standards, isn't the highest in the world. (maybe around the 10th) The US debt fuels it's economy and the US economy (the demand and consumption) is crucial for many other economies around the world. Many countries would support it simply because not doing so would damage their own economies badly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sovereign debt is really weird for countries that issue it in denominations they control. They can always repay it by creating more money. You should see as more of a way to draw money out of the economy to control inflation, as more money lent to the government means less money chasing scarce goods and services. </p>
<p>Itâ€™s not debt like you student loans are, or your mortgage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the debt we owe is mostly to our own citizens, as well as the world's wealthy. Also, the interest in U.S. debt is hilariously low (1.25% for a 30 year bond). So, one wonders, if the value of the asset is so poor, why do people buy them? The answer is that the New York Stock Exchange is <em>denominated</em> in T-Bills. When you're in a neutral position, that's where your money is parked. So most of the U.S. debt, in addition to funding the government, is also acting as scrip (a substitute for money) for the financial sector.</p>
<p>So think about it like this: If you had a business, and you could borrow money at 1.25%, and invest it in your business with an expectation of earning 2.5%, then you'd have an incentive to borrow as much money as possible, as long as you can buy more of whatever you're getting that 2.5% return from.</p>
<p>Finally, the biggest thing to understand is that countries don't go broke like households, when they can print their own currency. So if the U.S. government finds itself in a position where it can't pay back the $25TN it owes to everybody, it can and will print more money, devaluing the currency, and effectively reducing the payout to the holders of the debt. This will do a few things: Make the debt easier to pay off, shaving the profits of the holders of the debt, and make imports more expensive and exports cheaper, which in turn will boost the country's economy. Effectively, you give the country a pay cut, and make importing things from abroad more expensive thereby.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Debt is not necessarily a bad thing.  Money in hand is usually better than the promise of money later.  In order to pay for a project, you need a lot of upfront cash.  The USA could afford to pay for the project by collecting taxes for the next ten years, but they need the money <em>now</em>.  So, instead of waiting, they go into debt to raise that money.  While in debt, they comfortably make their payments and eventually pay it off.</p>
<p>For example, let's say the USA wants to build a bridge.  This bridge will cost $100 million dollars upfront to get started.  The USA does not have that money on hand.  Instead, they borrow the money and build it right away and pay it off for the next 10 years.  Yes, they would have to pay interest on that loan, but having that bridge in position 10 years earlier means they can also get 10 years worth of revenue from that bridge, which could be more than the interest lost.</p>
<p>Everybody uses this same principle.   Very few people can afford to buy a house.  However, they might have good jobs and could afford to buy one if they save money for the next 20 year.  But, since they cannot live on the street for 20 years, they get a mortgage and buy the house now.  Living in that house for an extra twenty years is worth the added cost on interest on that mortgage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing is that a big part of the US's debt is to it's own people.  This doesn't sound like it makes sense, but if you break it down into how the US Treasury Department sells bonds, and should pay them back, it starts to become clearer.</p>
<p>As in, if you buy a bond today for $1,000, you'd wait the 5 or 10 or 20 years (however long it ends up being), and get paid back $1,000 plus whatever interest rate is on it.  Lets say you'd get back $1,250.  Technically, the government &quot;loses&quot; $250 here, but there's a decent enough chance that they'll make that up with further bond sales, they could use tax revenue to cover the gap, and so on.</p>
<p>Another big hole, as far as debt is concerned, comes down to retirement accounts for government personnel &amp; military, along with social security payouts.  Again, this is money that the US government owes it's own people.</p>
<p>In terms of other debt to other countries or similar non-US entities, the US <em>typically</em> pays that off in full and on time.  I'm sure there's been some exceptions and hang-ups, but a few billion owed to a random country is next to nothing compared to the trillions the US owes to it's own people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
