		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and it works both directions -- vaccinated people exposed to wild infection can get a boost, and previously-infected people given vaccines get a boost. </p>
<p>(Side note, antibodies don’t really have an “expiration date” and if they did it certainly wouldn’t be a year. Antibodies following many vaccines or infections last for decades. While obviously we don’t know just how long the COVID vaccine antibodies will last, the rate of drop off we see says they’ll last for many years. And of course, even after antibodies are gone, the memory cells remain, usually for life.)</p>
<p>In the former case, the boost from exposure to wild infections became a concern in measles vaccination, because once measles was eliminated from the US (for example) then vaccinated people wouldn't be getting that boost from exposure to infected people:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many studies have suggested that vaccine-induced immunity is persistent, perhaps even lifelong, but most were performed in an era when <strong>boosting from wild-type virus was common</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>--<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/569784" target="_blank">Persistence of Measles Antibodies After 2 Doses of Measles Vaccine in a Postelimination Environment</a></p>
<p>(The potential problem didn't turn out to be a problem, because the current measles vaccination program does give very long-lived immunity even without wild virus boosting immunity.)</p>
<p>In the latter case, to mention a completely random example that probably hadn't occurred to anyone reading this, it's been shown that people who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and subsequently vaccinated ended up with an excellent boost -- the infection itself was roughly comparable to the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine (but was more variable), but the boost led to a very strong antibody response.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we show that the antibody response to the first vaccine dose in individuals with pre-existing immunity is equal to or even exceeds the titers found in naïve individuals after the second dose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>--<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.29.21250653v1" target="_blank">Robust spike antibody responses and increased reactogenicity in seropositive individuals after a single dose of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine</a></p>
<p>This fits with theory, of course, because immunologically a booster dose is a booster dose, regardless of the source of the prime and boost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: yes but keep in mind that cells are producing these antibodies, and these cells  are reactivated to produce more ab when exposed to an antigen that they recognize (the word antigen comes from antibody generator)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing I would like to mention is that while antibodies are cool, and how many you have floating around in your blood does give you some protecting, making memory cells is better.  They are the things the explosively replicate and make antibodies, if they are B cells.  The memory T cells make your cytotoxic T cells .  All of those are also important in provide a response to a second exposure of a pathogen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's been explained, but yes, that can happen. The discovery that led to the creation of viruses was that milk maids (I think) who contracted cowpox seemed to get much less severe or no infections from small pox while those who never had cowpox did. Cowpox is a much less severe version of smallpox, but the proteins are/were similar enough that it when the body met smallpox, it was already &quot;ready&quot; and able to respond quicker. The guy who came up with vaccines after that ended up testing his theory on children (yeah that's a little unethical).</p>
<p>In more sciencey talk, essentially when the antibody producing cells begin to make antibodies, they actually scramble them, see if the antibodies stick to anything, and then reproduce. The ones that kinda stuck but not well get scrambled further. The ones that don't stick well or stick to self-derived stuff kill themselves. This goes on until all that's really left are antibodies that bind to the virus/bacteria/protein/etc well enough to get that survival signal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of unknowns in a disease. There could be a lifetime of future conditions that are caused by it. Whereas a vaccine has had the safety tests and had those underlying possibilities removed (hopefully). All diseases are different as well, some stay in your body and are dormant, but could come forth later in life, some are defeated and you are immune, and still others just live on and can be spread to others even if they are not actively affecting you. TLDR: It depends on the disease.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
