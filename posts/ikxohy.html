		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The minimum age was lightly debated (there is also minimum ages for house and senate members) and in the end the writers of the Constitution enacted them without too much dissent. </p>
<p>The general for and against the min age arguments  aren’t very insightful or interesting either. Basically some argued that they don’t want to stop a person from holding the role due to their younger age, and that young people can and have excelled in high raking govt roles, others said they want this person to have had experience gained over time as a person in the US and skills from being older. The older crowd won out. </p>
<p>To add on, minimum ages for parliament was a thing in England at the time (21) so setting a minimum age was a pretty normal idea that was already in use elsewhere in similar systems. </p>
<p>There was no discussion of a maximum age only a minimum so there is nothing to say on that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maximum age is more subjective than minimum age.  A lot of people change a lot between 18-25-40.  While you have issues with the older candidates in this cycle, there are often people who would be &quot;unfit&quot; if you put a max age limit who many consider sound of mind.  For example, Bernie Sanders.  Agree or disagree politically, his mind hasn't given way.  The same would have been said for Barbara Bush.  When she died (at 93) it was a shock because she was mentally there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As for no upper limit, the older you are the more experienced you likely are and thus better suited for the job but no one's gonna wanna be president in their 80s and if they do no one's gonna vote for someone who's likely to croak any second. But if someone in their golden years does run and people do vote for him or her(but seriously, him. We're not that enlightened) then that's fine because he would be very experienced and have a vice president for when he inevitably croaks...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
