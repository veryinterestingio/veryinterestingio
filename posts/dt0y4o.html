<p>it knows how much you're moving around, because moving around moves it.  it can track your heart rate pretty accurately.</p>
<p>it uses the combination of those two things - are you moving around? are you calming down? to try to come up with some kind of guesstimate about how well you're sleeping and if you're sleeping.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I assume Fitbit uses this method, but I might be wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who did tech support for &quot;a multinational mobile phone company&quot; (NDAs amiright?) I can tell you the technology used on those smart watches is actually very dumb. It tracks heart rate and movement pretty well (although I would regularly get calls from people who said their smart watch showed a massive heartrate spike while they were sitting down and totally calm. Something my superiors told me was a feature to detect heart attacks, as opposed to the obvious software bug it actually was) and then makes wild and often inacurate guesses based on that information.</p>
<p>It's not to be taken seriously, cause there is little to no scientific testing done on these devices before they get shipped out, and faulty hardware or software is passed off as &quot;features&quot; introduced after a problem has been detected. don't take these readings seriously! They are mere guidelines that are relatively accurate for most people, but have major flaws that make them generally unreliable</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
