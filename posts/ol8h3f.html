		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Somewhere in between, but it's closer to half the stimulation for the full time than full stimulation for half-time.</p>
<p>The &quot;energy&quot; is just a bunch of caffeine, which doesn't give any actual energy, it blocks the &quot;tired&quot; signal in the brain. And your body can only process caffeine so quickly. How ever much caffeine you consume, about half of it is gone in 4-5 hours (and in another 4-5 hours half of <em>that</em> is gone, and so on.) There is no way it can all be gone in 2.5 hours. The caffeine level in your body will be about a half-height peak for about as long as drinking the whole thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simplest answer is the most disappointing: It depends.</p>
<p>Different bodies metabolize (process, use) caffeine differently.</p>
<p>You have two cars. One car can run faster than the other despite having the same basic engine size. Caffeine in the human body is similar, in that <em>metabolization</em> can be very different despite the two people looking similar on the outside.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, body weight and size factor too. A large car needs more gasoline than a small car. Similarly, a small body will go farther with less caffeine.</p>
<p>At some point there are diminishing returns to scale. So a very large/tall person will not get &quot;2.5 hours&quot; from the caffeine in a 5 hour energy. But a small/short person may metabolize caffeine more efficiently.</p>
<p>If you need a gallon of gas to drive to your destination, a large vehicle may not make it there on half a gallon. <strong>Threshold doses</strong> are like that. You may need more in your system to get the &quot;kick&quot; that you expect from a 5 hour energy. Odds are, unless you are highly caffeine tolerant - you will feel <em>something</em> with half of a 5 hour energy drink. But it may not be exactly half as strong. It could be more, it could be less.</p>
<p>Genetics in the liver, specifically the CYP2C  and CYP3A4 enzymes also play a role, but that's not easy to explain to a five year old.</p>
<p>Source: Too much medical work to rebuild a body with two skull fractures. Dosing caffeine was... necessary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not a medicine that gives energy for 5 hours, it's just a bunch of caffeine. Depends on how regularly you consume caffeine. If you do drink 1-2 cups of coffee per day, less effect. I hardly drink caffeine and if I took one in the morning, there's a good chance I won't be able to sleep at night.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
