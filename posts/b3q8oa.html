		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as I can tell, there is no clear cut upper ceiling limit for the brightness in light. But there is a lot of nuance to explore so let's ask three questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Does the light ever get so bright that it interacts with itself through gravity?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the light ever get so bright that it interacts with itself through electromagnetism or another fundamental force?</p>
</li>
<li>Does the answers in the above two questions depend on whether or not the light beams are parallel or if they have some intersection angle between them?</li>
</ol>
<p>Before we begin we can note that in principle I can Lorentz-boost myself into any reference frame giving a single photon as much energy as I want. In that sense, there is truly no upper ceiling. But real light is a multitude of photons so let us continue. (<strong>Edit:</strong> For the purposes of our discussion, brightness means intensity of light or power/area. From a photon perspective that means the same intensity can be reached from a lot of low energy photons or a few high energy photons.)</p>
<p>For now let's restrict ourselves to a beam of light that is moving parallel, in other-words, if nothing else happens the rays in the beam will never intersect. It turns out that a beam of light does distort space-time. However, the space-time deformation produced by massless objects, like light, aren't in any way like the bending of space-time caused by masses, which give you Newtonian gravity. Rather the gravitational field of a light beam is a kind of gravitational radiation called &quot;plane-fronted gravitational waves.&quot;</p>
<p>These solutions were initially worked out using &quot;linearized general relativity&quot; which makes gravity act in a similar fashion to electromagnetism. However it was later found that these solutions were actually exact for full general relativity which is wonderful because it lets us talk about very high intensity light. As a strange aside, this solution is also the same solution for a black hole traveling near (in the limit of) the speed of light relative to an observer. Plane-fronted gravitation waves traveling in the z-direction have the line-element,</p>
<ul>
<li>ds^(2) = (c^(2)dt^(2)-dx^(2)-dy^(2)-dz^(2)) + A(cdt-dz)^(2)</li>
</ul>
<p>where A is related to the intensity of the light. This is the equation for a small straight line in space-time which is similar to Pythagoras's theorem. Think of &quot;dz&quot; as a small change in the z-direction. The first part of the metric is just normal flat space-time, the second part is the interesting part,</p>
<ul>
<li>ds'^(2) = A(cdt-dz)^(2)</li>
</ul>
<p>This basically tells you that the &quot;plane&quot; which is <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NormalVector.html" target="_blank">normal to the direction of travel</a> is special in some way. It turns out that it is only in this plane that spacetime is deformed. The interesting consequence of this is that since the space-time deformation also travels at the speed of light and only exists attached to the beam of light, any light sent after the first beam cannot interact with the original beam. In other words, light beams do not make gravitational wakes like a speed boat in water. Another feature is that the gravitational fields of parallel light beams (say A1 and A2 intensities for beam 1 and beam 2) simply add together and do not otherwise influence each other's motion. This means parallel beams of light do not interact.</p>
<p>Now the second question. I won't go through the details like I did for gravitation, but in short parallel light beams do not interact with each-other through electromagnetism either. This is true in both the classical theory (where electromagnetism is linear and even non-parallel light doesn't interact) and the quantum field theory (QFT) called quantum electrodynamics (QED).</p>
<p>The third question is where all the fun happens then. Nonparallel light beams, and most especially intersecting light beams do interact! Gravitationally, nonparallel beams will attract each other and the attraction is strongest when they are moving in opposite directions (aka antiparallel). In other-words, the beams will not move in straight lines, but along a curve. (<strong>Edit:</strong> This is not too surprising considering just special relativity where the invariant mass of two nonparallel light beams is nonzero. This mass, made purely out of massless light, then naturally should gravitate. This invariant mass is also relevant in particle production from light described further down.) In fact, there is a situation called a &quot;Kugelblitz&quot; where if the nonparallel beams are confined to a small enough space, an event horizon forms around them trapping them in a newly formed black hole whose mass is given by the energy of the trapped light. As an aside, hypothetically a quantum theory of gravity may lead to higher order interactions, but those are not well understood as we do not yet have a complete theory of quantum gravity.</p>
<p>Electromagnetically, as far as I can tell, only the intersecting light beams has been explored. I am unaware of research along the lines of simply nonparallel beams. The self-interaction of light through electromagnetism is only a quantum effect and not present in the low energy limit (read: long distance) which explains why this is the case. Even in QED we don't expect nonparallel beams to interact, we need them to get close enough to &quot;count&quot; as a collision. There are two main avenues of studying light self-interaction in QED. The first is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breit%E2%80%93Wheeler_process" target="_blank">Breit–Wheeler process</a> process which is the production of an electron-positron pair via colliding light. You can make other particles too, but the electron-positron process is favored because it is the lowest mass particle pair. The second process is light-light scattering where two photons will bounce off each other and travel in new directions. The best measurement for this actually was just released <a href="https://home.cern/news/news/physics/atlas-observes-light-scattering-light" target="_blank">a few days ago</a> done using lead-lead collisions at the LHC.</p>
<p>All this nonparallel stuff is what might limit the max brightness of a beam. Any scattering due to gravitational attraction or QED light-light scattering will defocus a beam of light and any pair-production will sap away energy from the beam as well. This means the stability of our light beam, and our ability to keep increasing the brightness depends on our ability to keep the light perfectly parallel.</p>
<p>Anyway the fruit of all this is that we are now prepared to discuss the original question: <strong>Can you have a flashlight producing an arbitrary brightness?</strong> The answer is no, but I have no Earthly idea what that max brightness would be. It would be incredibly high. No beam of light is perfectly parallel (because any real process which produces light does so with an angular distribution) which means at sufficient intensities, the beam will at some point be reduced in brightness due to the production of particle pairs, scattering which disperses the beam even further lowering the brightness and even potentially producing a black hole. Exactly which process is important first depends on the wavelength, and therefore the energy, of the photons in your light beam.</p>
