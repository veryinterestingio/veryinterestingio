		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All the answers in here are correct, but very few cheeses expire within &quot;a few days&quot; after opening.  Most will last for weeks if not months(especially harder cheeses).  Even pre-shredded cheese, which spoils faster due to exposed surface area, usually has an official expiration date of a week after opening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cheeses are aged in fairly controlled environments and typically sealed (wax, rind, wrapping, etc.) during that process. Once you open the package, molds and other critters can get at it and go to town. </p>
<p>With most cheeses that's just a surface thing though, you can usually cut off the offending critters and the underlying cheese is just fine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aging =/= spoiling.</p>
<p>Cheese is aged under controlled conditions that inhibit the growth of bacteria and rancidification of fats. Cultured cheese also uses carefully selected non-pathogenic bacteria that don't cause illness or degraded the cheese (for a while).</p>
<p>Cheese sitting in your fridge has none of those conditions. It's going to be colonized by the first strain of bacteria that gets a foothold there, and its up to chance whether its dangerous to ingest. The fats in the cheese will begin to go rancid, which is a chemical reaction you really can't stop. </p>
<p>So it comes down to the difference in controlled conditions of aging vs sitting in your refrigerator.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If you always wash your hands first, and then avoid touching the cheese and knife blade with your skin, it will last longer. My mom taught me this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
