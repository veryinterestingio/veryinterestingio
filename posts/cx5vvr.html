		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh I know this one. Finally I can contribute.</p>
<p>Mustard was originally engineered with a tapered top because it used a Twist top cap that allowed you to open it by turning it. By making the nozzle more like a funnel you increase the surface area between the closed nozzle and the open nozzle. Old natural gas valves sometimes work this way as well. By increasing the surface area you create a better seal.</p>
<p>This is necessary because when you take mustard out of the refrigerator the cold air trapped inside the bottle tries to expand and if you had a normal nozzle on the Barrel shaped container it would eventually pop open forcefully. </p>
<p>Now imagine mustard is trapped at the top between the cap and the air pocket. </p>
<p>Mustard volcano! </p>
<p>The funnel shaped nozzle allows you to easily open the bottle, dispense the mustard, and close the bottle, while keeping the mustard inside.</p>
<p>Modern inverted containers don't have this problem because generally the weight of the bottle was enough to keep them closed and modern plastics give a bit more, so they often have the same caps as other condiments.</p>
<p>Edit: wow, who knew my first major comment on Reddit would be about a mustard bottle. I'm trying to get to all the questions as quickly as I can, I just got done with work and checked my inbox and holy cow. Also thanks for the silver Anonymous stranger!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mustard is mostly for squiggling on, either on a hot dog or on bread, ketchup is for splooshing, generally.</p>
<p>The nozzle design corresponds to the main use of the condiment. Look at mayo... mostly jars to use a knife to spread onto stuff. If they make a squeeze bottle it's usually long and flat to cover lots of surface area.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
