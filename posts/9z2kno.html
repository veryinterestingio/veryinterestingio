		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To produce sound, your vocal cords need to be able to swing freely.
When you lose your voice, they're not moving freely, either due to the swelling of the infection, or other obstructions.</p>
<p>Real ELI5 : your voice works like a guitar. If you press a pillow down on the guitar cords, their aren't going to make noises. </p>
<p>Edit1: Gramar</p>
<p>Edit2: To all of you who want to know more about how the voice is produced, here is more of a ELI15 explanation.
For the sake of this explanation, I'm going to use the latin names of the anatomical structures, as english isn't my native language. </p>
<p>The Larynx has 3 stages, and sits on top of the trachea : </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Vestibulum Larygis, with the Plicae vestibulares</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Ventriculus larygis, with the Plicae vocales</p>
</li>
<li>The Cavitas infraglottica</li>
</ul>
<p>The Plicae vestibularis humidifie and clean the plicae vocales during swallowing. It's possible to use them as &quot;backup voice generators&quot; with a lot of training if for any reasons the plicae vocales are paralysed.</p>
<p>Lets have a closer look at the plicae vocales, our actual voice generator. Beneith the tunica mucose, medial you'll find the ligamentum vocale, and lateral the M. vocalis. The M. Vocalis can, if the contracts, bring both sides closer together and even close the rima glottidis. </p>
<p>Between the Tunica mucosa and the lig. vocale you'll find a thin layer (The Reinke's space) of loose connective tissue, enabling them to shift. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinke%27s_edema" target="_blank">A chronic edema</a> in the reinke space causes the smokers voice. </p>
<p>Of course, this is only the basics of where the voice is generated. </p>
<p>To produce sounds, the air rushing through the larynx coming from the lungs pass by the small gap made by the Plicae vocalis, making them vibrate, similar to the single reed of a woodwind instrument.
The more relaxed the Plicae vocalis are, the slower they vibrate and therfore the deeper the sound produces. </p>
<p>The sound is then modulated in the rest of the Larynx, Pharynx, and Sinuses, lips and tongue, to exit as voice. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, a lot of bad terminology and misconceptions in this post so far. </p>
<p>You make sound by sending air through your vocal FOLDS, not chords. Common wrong terminology. </p>
<p>You have two flaps of very thin membrane that sit in the middle of your larynx. They vibrate extremely quickly when you bring them together and send air through them to produce sound. Very much like a trumpet player’s lips into a trumpet. </p>
<p>However your folds don’t just vibrate like a cell phone, they wave along each other. It’s super interesting in slow motion.</p>
<p>Anyways, swelling on your folds prevents the perfect closure of these very thin pieces of tissue. The larger the swelling, the harder it is to force the two sides together. Most people lose only parts of their voices because they can still make their folds vibrate together at lower frequencies that require less vibration and the folds are still able to come together despite the irregularity. But if the swelling (or in severe cases, the growth) on your vocal folds is large enough it can prevent you from talking at all. </p>
<p>Swelling is caused the same way as any other swelling. From impact. Every time you speak your folds come together. But if you yell they can come together more violently. When you cough or clear your throat, your folds come together VERY violently. So losing your voice is a product of swelling created by friction, not by any kind of phlegm or other obstruction.
Edit: you can also have swelling on your folds from the infection itself as someone pointed out, but you can prevent this from worsening, and also allow it to heal faster by not coughing.</p>
<p>Im an opera singer, and when I get sick my main goal is to prevent myself from coughing. The less I cough during an illness, the faster my vocal folds will recover afterwards. </p>
<p>When smokers lose the ability to speak, it’s usually because one or both of their folds becomes paralyzed, or has to be removed. And since you can’t force one of your vocal folds all the way to the other side of your throat, it’s impossible to make vibration and therefore no sound. </p>
<p>Reason I know: I’m an opera singer who has taken multiple vocal science classes. I also once suffered an impact to the throat that made it impossible for me to speak for 6 weeks due to a massive bruise on my vocal fold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You produce sound when air passes and vibrates the tissue of your larynx (vocal chords). When you get laryngitis this tissue becomes inflamed and swollen causing distortion of that vibration. If you overuse your voice box you can develop nodules in your vocal chords resulting in similar symptoms. Often this presents as voice cracks, horseness and breathy speech. Think of the sound plucking a tight guitar string makes. Now imagine that guitar string is covered in thick mucus, misshapen and loose on the fret board. Our vocal chords are quite delicate and minor damage changes how they vibrate quite a lot</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to what other posts have said - there are many reasons for reduced movement in the vocal folds, from stress to infection to temporary muscle paralysis. Best thing to do is drink warm water, relax, and if it persists see your doctor/ENT (as it could be infection or something more serious/chronic like nodules, nerve damage, or cancer)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
