		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Smelling salts ampoules contain a small amount of ammonia. Ammonia triggers an inhalation reaction. Taking a deep breath brings more oxygen into the body.</p>
<p>As an aside, this also illustrates why ammonia spills (in large industrial quantities, not household quantities)  are so bad. The ammonia displaces the oxygen, but also triggers a reflexive reaction to inhale, so a victim breathes more of it in. Pretty much every safety team training plan includes having to watch a video where a highway patrol cop arrives on scene at a semi wreck where the container the semi was pulling was venting ammonia. The cop either wasn't trained for hazmat response or forgot his training and grabbed his first aid kit and ran in to try to help the driver. He succumbed to the ammonia gas in a few seconds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Smelling salts are basically a really strong smelling powder, which irritates your nose, making you take a big breath. They were used for rousing people who had &quot;fainted&quot; from a shock, a bad smell, or the sight of blood. They can occasionally make people focus on the smell or simply breathe more deeply, which can prevent a syncope. They don't do anything when someone is actually unconscious though, and they can cause irritation of the airway if used frequently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anecdote from my dad, who is a doctor:</p>
<p>My dad worked in the radiology department. Occasionally the contrast dye  (injected liquid that shows up on scans,) would cause someone to pass out. A new tech who has never encountered this would usually try to wake them up with smelling salts. The tech would sit the patient up while waving the salts under their nose. A more seasoned tech would then come in, drop the table to the flat position, lay the patient down, and throw the smelling salts in the trash.</p>
<p>The reason the patient passed out is because the contrast caused a drop in their blood pressure. Sitting the patient up is the exact opposite of what they need. They need blood in their brain, which can't happen with low BP and the brain higher than the heart.</p>
<p>So, smelling salts are not effective when the patient's brain is deprived of oxygen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>they're ammonia. inhalation causes minor irritation to the airways, triggering a reflex that counters certain kinds of fainting. </p>
<p>fainting is caused by vasodilation. basically, your blood vessels open up too much and instead of trying to push your blood through a straw, it's trying to power a fire hose. doesn't work too well.</p>
<p>the disruption to breathing caused by the ammonia causes reflexive vascular constriction. this can sometimes be enough for the body to pull itself together and maintain a proper blood pressure.</p>
<p>the reflex itself is quite powerful and can illicit <em>some</em> response in all but the worst circumstances. its ability to restore consciousness depends on the cause being vasodilation, and the body being able to maintain the elevated blood pressure after the salts hit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You cannot “smell” while unconscious, hence why so many people die in house fires. Ammonia specifically triggers a pain receptor in the brain. The “pain” that your brain thinks your experiencing is what wakes you up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
