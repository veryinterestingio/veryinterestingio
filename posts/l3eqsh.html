		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The healing process does impact your body; the scab will tug on the skin a bit, and there may be some inflammation. The itching/scratching sensation is your body's sense of touching telling you something is wrong in that area. These two systems are working independently, so your sense of touch is just reacting to this tension on the skin.</p>
<p>It's counterproductive, sure, but our bodies aren't perfect. And if this isn't posing a significant problem to our evolutionary purpose (to survive long enough to reproduce), then there won't be any evolutionary pressure for this to change.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Injured cells and the cells that do the work of healing release molecules called cytokines to communicate with each other so that the right cells are doing the right things at the right time. These are the same kinds of things of molecules you hear about in &quot;cytokine storm&quot; that can be such an problem in Covid infections. Sometimes the effects of these chemicals are useful, sometimes they are annoying. Histamine, for example, might help you to get rid of something irritating by sneezing or scratching, but the itchiness might also be annoying in a healing wound. Also, when blood in an old wound or bruise breaks down, it becomes bilirubin, which just happens to be something really itchy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another thing to keep in mind is our &quot;animal past&quot;, as a lot of evolution effects stem from that.
When you don't have hands and something itches... you lick it. Just like animals do. And that has the effect of cleaning the wound and the salvia is mildly antiseptic as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely an answer to the question as someone else already answered it, but picking at a scab does to a cretsin degree help it heal better. Scabs collect dirt and grime, if it cracks or gets something underneath it, the wound can quickly get infected. In some cases its beneficial to have a fresh scab</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
