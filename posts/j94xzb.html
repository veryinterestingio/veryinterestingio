		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the Solar system Saturn is the most oblate. We do not know for exoplanets as it is very difficult to measure the spin rate <del>(to my knowlage this has not yet been done).</del></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For stars, I give you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VFTS_102" target="_blank">VFTS 102</a>. This is a very massive star that is rotating 1 million <del>times</del> miles an hour (500 km/s and probably as large as 600 km/s). The star is rotating so fast that it has formed a disc (it is literally breaking itself apart... slightly... it will not kill itself). ESA provide a nice <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1147/" target="_blank">summary</a> of this star including how it is thought to have gained so much angular momentum (although there are other possible explanations). Unfortunately I could not find any estimates on the polar and equatorial radii but it will be the most oblate object we know (despite that pulsars rotate faster, they are more compact and rigid so have lower deformation). This might not be surprising to those in the know as the radius of a star is not measured directly and so we would likely need to model this star to work out its dimensions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thought I would add a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6vU3-LGrgM&amp;ab_channel=FraserCain" target="_blank">youtube</a> video which includes the rough dimensions of another highly deformed star, Achenar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My knowlage has been updated (from an observation made 6 years ago... it is amazing what you can miss when the field moves so fast!)... We do have examples of observations of rotation period of planets (although this seems to be limited to long period planets far from their host star) such as the oh so famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Pictoris_b" target="_blank">Beta Pictoris b</a>.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotating_black_hole" target="_blank">A rotating black hole with sufficient angular momentum</a> will have a distorted event horizon with a prominent equatorial bulge, though given that they aren’t physical objects in the conventional sense and given that they will be optically highly distorted anyway this is probably not the best example.</p>
<p>The most oblate object we know about is the dwarf planet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haumea" target="_blank">Haumea</a>, which we discovered in 2004. It is approximately a third the size of Pluto and has an equatorial diameter almost double that of its polar diameter. It’s believed that Haumea’s high angular momentum is the result of a collision with another object.</p>
<p>Modelling mathematically we can predict that for a rocky planet like Earth the maximum possible oblateness would be around 3:1 - that is, its equatorial diameter could be up to three times its polar diameter before the planet started to break apart due to the angular momentum at its equator cancelling out its gravity. Such a planet would have an extraordinary gravitational gradient across its surface, with gravity being apparently much less at the equator than it would be at the poles despite there being much more of the planet’s mass beneath you there. For gas giants, which are much more “fluid”, the maximum oblateness is closer to 2:1. Such oblateness is highly unlikely to occur in nature as our current models of planetary formation suggest that a lot of angular momentum is lost as planets condense out of the protoplanetary disc of their parent star, but as with Haumea, it could theoretically arise as a result of an interplanetary collision.</p>

If we were to somehow get onto the surface of an object that is rotating that fast, but not so massive that it would normally kill us outright, would we be able to exist there?
