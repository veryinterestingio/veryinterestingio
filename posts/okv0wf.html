		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Inflation encourages spending. Economies work because people interact with it, and exchange money. The worst thing to happen to an economy is if people simply stopped using it.</p>
<p>Inflation helps push that along, it encourages you to do something with your money, meaning spend it, not save too much.</p>
<p>Though its often easier to see from the opposite side: deflation. That means if I don't spend my money, it will grow. That means the entire economy is better of not interacting with each other and sitting there doing nothing. No jobs, no spending, nothing, you just sit there. You can imagine how successful an economy would be if no one wanted to spend money on anything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That’s exactly it. </p>
<p>Consumer spending drives about 2/3 of the economy. Inflation helps ensure that money is being moved around instead of being held stagnant - this is required for an economy to work. </p>
<p>If you knew that in a year the cash stuffed in your mattress will be worth 3% less than it is now, you’d want to at least put it into an investment that gains 3% a year, right?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A small amount of inflation compels people to use their money, either spending it or investing it. This means money is either being injected into the economy through spending, or is available for businesses and people to borrow, which also generates economic activity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's impossible to maintain a currency at a perfectly stable value, and deflation is MUCH more damaging to an economy than inflation. Therefore, a currency fluctuating in mild inflation (under 3%) is generally seen as the ideal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answers here are wrong, it is not to encourage spending. I would encourage anyone to ask questions on /r/AskEconomics, where there is actually high quality standards.</p>
<p>An economist wrote a longer, more complicated explanation <a href="https://pastebin.com/p0AEbSnS" target="_blank">here</a>. The basic ELI5 is that there are several competing factors, and about 2% per year (what most developed countries target) is a decent compromise between those factors. I wish I can write an ELI5 of some of those factors if anyone really wants, but it's going to get pretty long and likely can't fit within an ELI5 level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
