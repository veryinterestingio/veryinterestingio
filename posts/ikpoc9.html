Assuming prehistoric man was not brushing their teeth, how did they survive? Wouldn't their teeth rot and prevent them from properly consuming food?</p>
<p>Edit: Wow, this turned into an epic discussion on dental health in not only humans but other animals too. You guys are awesome!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The earliest toothbrushes we found are from 3.500BC, but the dental records show that we started brushing our teeth much earlier, or otherwise we would see much more plaque and damage. </p>
<p>Some chewed specific weeds, roots or sticks that had antibacterial qualities and cleaned away the plaque.</p>
<p>For example here's a scientific paper showing evidence that members of the genus Homo brushed their teeth already 1.2 million years ago. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Additional biographical detail includes fragments of non-edible wood found adjacent to an interproximal groove suggesting oral hygiene activities</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here's another one about humans deliberately drilling holes in teeth as a form of early dentistry 14.000 years ago </p>

<p>So, as far as we know we always found something to brush our teeth with, because the alternative is just so painful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The diet then was substantially different and did not constitute simple sugars that you eat today. With the Dawn of agriculture approximately 10k years ago, the diet changed to carb intense which while had other positive impacts in human progress, is not sufficient time for various parts of our body to evolve ( diabetes, heart issues etc). Even the sweet fruits you eat today are selectively bred over the last few thousand years. The diet a million years would have looked very different.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a German series called <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinzeit_%E2%80%93_Das_Experiment" target="_blank">Steinzeit - Das Experiment</a>. This was scientifically guided. Almost all of the volunteers got cavities after a short time. A boy instead chewed up one end of sticks and brushed his teeth with that and got no cavities. So I assume that this was no new invention, but the stone age people already knows how to take care of their teeth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
