The aches and crummy feeling you get when you’re sick aren’t caused directly by the pathogen, they’re a result of what your immune system is doing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A good immune system has many different types of cells. One ‘serious, last resort’ type of cell the body uses is the neutrophil. </p>
<p>A neutrophil acts like a wide-area explosive that, when meeting the target pathogen, self destructs to cause immediate death of the pathogen BUT ALSO causes the death of a bunch of healthy, in-use cells in the same area. </p>
<p>This is a calculated risk the body makes, like throwing a frag grenade (or 5) in your own home to hopefully get rid of 10 armed robbers hanging out in a room together. All your stuff is ruined and needs to be replaced, but at least you get your house back. </p>
<p>When a person has billions of neutrophils in their body that get the signal to do their thing... you can imagine the effects. Sometimes, you (the house) barely survive!</p>
<p>Ironically, the healthier you are, the more numerous and robust your neutrophil count is. This is one of the main reasons Ebola is so deadly, it confuses your neutrophils into attacking the body. Healthier people are more damaged internally because of this, while an immunodeficient person (child/elderly person) may have a better chance. </p>
<p>I should point out that VERY FEW pathogens and viruses can manipulate your own immune system in this way, and for almost every case, our immune system is more cunning and powerful (and vaccinated, in order to recognize invaders on sight, instead of inviting them to dinner) than 99.99% of the bad stuff. </p>
<p>Get vaccinated! It’s like uploading a whole gun library into your body instead of relying on the family pistol  your mom &amp; dad gave you. </p>
<p>Edit: Holy moly my first ever medal!! :D Thank you kind stranger!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't true (in the states), anymore. Kids (and adults who haven't had it) are encouraged to be vaccinated against the chicken pox because having it can lead to shingles in adulthood if your immune system is compromised. It's no longer encouraged to expose anyone to it. Shingles are horrible.
Edit: Clarifying that kids can also get shingles after getting the chicken pox, not just adults.
Edit again: Yes. You can get shingles if you've had the chicken pox vaccine but it's FAR more rare. Get vaccinated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
