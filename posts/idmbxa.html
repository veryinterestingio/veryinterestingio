		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The question is somewhat flawed, because they actually do mix... sort of. Where they interact at the straits of Gibraltar, vast amounts of water flow from the Atlantic into the Mediterranean, but distinct layers of water have developed because of the difference in salinity (and therefore density), which causes them to differentiate; they do mix farther from the straits as currents bring the water farther away. There is a constant interchange between the two bodies, though the input from the Atlantic greatly outweighs the Mediterranean's input into the former.</p>
<p>If you look at a current map of the region, you'll see that water is always flowing from the Atlantic into the Mediterranean, and as you travel east the salinity of the water increases because water is constantly evaporating, and the input of fresh water from rivers is not strong enough to outweigh it.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In the past, the straits of Gibraltar have raised above sea level by tectonic action, and the Mediterranean has actually dried up (though with some water left from river sources) due to the lack of input from the Atlantic.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>That is not to say that all water in that region is flowing into the Mediterranean, though. Because the water of the Mediterranean is so salty, some of it sinks below the Atlantic inflow and flows out of the straits. These outflows are redirected north and form significant salt deposits along the Spanish continental shelf.</p>

<p>Thank you u/Gondwanalandia for bringing this up!</p>

<p>EDIT: Formatting, Mediterranean Outflow Water added with sources, introduction section revised to include this information. I apologize for any confusion, I'm trying to keep this accurate since I doubt a better answer will be able to rise to the top at this point because of how Reddit works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do mix, but do so inefficiently because the strait is only a couple of hundred meters deep while the average depth of the Atlantic is 5000 m and the Med is 3000-4000m. That strait is like an underwater mountain range inhibiting easy mixing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer is, they do, but it takes time.</p>
<p>Take a look at Thermohaline Circulation. As waters with different temperature and salinities come together, their different densities cause them to move up and down vertically to come to equilibrium. This is “mixing” but on a very large scale. The same type of situation happens with you put hot and cold water into a glass. The hot water rises, and the cold water sinks. But it’s a small amount so they mix and come to equilibrium quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
