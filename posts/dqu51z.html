		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Intervals. What we actually recognize is the &quot;distance&quot; in wavelength between the notes, not the individual notes themselves. Intervals are all defined by math and certain ones sound better than others. Pair that with a human's ability to recognize patterns, and you can understand music.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of you are answering this question as if OP was asking how melodies/harmonies are constructed from the perspective of music theory (describing intervals, etc.). It is important to note that this is not the question OP is asking. The question is how <em>humans can distinguish</em> melodies/harmonies from random notes. In other words, the question is about perception and musical cognition. For instance, why is it that a particular sequence of notes is <em>perceived</em> as a melody, and another sequence is not? The question OP is asking is arguably much more interesting than the one most of you are answering. Iâ€™d love to see someone well-versed in music psychology give an ELI5 answer to this question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Melody doesn't really &quot;exist,&quot; per se-- ultimately, melody is incredbily arbitrary. If you listen to <em>Twinkle Twinkle, Little Star</em>, there isn't anything inherently about the particular sequence of notes that makes it a melody. Rather, because that specific sequence of notes (or similar sequence of notes) is familiar to you, your brain is able to ascribe it meaning.</p>
<p>People actually gain the ability to recognize melody really early in life. One study looked at 8 month olds, and used 3 tones to create 6 simple &quot;melodies.&quot; They played these melodies in random order for 3 minutes to the infants, and then later played the original melodies with another sequence of new three-tone melodies. These new three-tone melodies used the same notes as the originals, but just in different order. It turns out that even at 8 months old, infants are able to recognize old melodies vs. new ones.</p>
<p>You may claim a weakness with this study-- these simple 3-tone melodies are far simply than anything you would hear in real life. Well, another study looked at 7-month old infants who were exposed to 2 Mozart sonatas every day for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks of not listening to any music, the infants still remembered the Mozart melodies.</p>
<p>So it looks like melodies are distinguished because we somehow ascribe meaning to them, and our ability to do so starts very early in life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans are incredibly skilled at recognizing patterns. Better than any other animal. So much so, that we often think we see a pattern when we don't. It's part of what makes us human and gives us human-level intelligence. Simple things like a repeating noise, especially something simple like a 3 note melody, is just inherently easy to identify for a human. We're just that good at recognizing a consistent pattern, and we will remember it for extremely long times after recognizing it. It's part of our biology, and one of the reason we're able to develop and understand language Language, really, is just a series of consistently patterned sounds we've all agreed to use and remember, and we can remember a LOT of them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
