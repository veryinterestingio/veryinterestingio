		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the main factors causing stiffness is the increase in fibrous tissue that restricts movement of muscles and joints.</p>
<p>Whenever we exercise vigorously at any age we produce microscopic tears in muscle and the connective tissues such as tendons, ligaments and fascia that keep our bodies in one piece. The tearing of tissue triggers inflammation. This is the process by which the body repairs itself. Part of the repair process involves laying down a scaffolding of collagen fibres, usually in a random disorganized manner rather than well aligned with the usual direction of pull on that part of the body. The matted fibres are what is called scar tissue. If we subject the newly deposited fibres to gentle movement, the misdirected fibres get either removed or re-aligned and we are left with correctly oriented fibres that allow our joints and muscle to function smoothly. However if we move too vigorously or erratically, we simply tear more fibres and re-commence the cycle of inflammation and repair.</p>
<p>Although the damage starts with vigorous movement, being sedentary does not help because collagen fibres also get laid down between adjacent tissues that are not moving, binding them together, so we would become completely moribund. If we then move forcefully the fibres will tear and we commence a cycle of inflammation and fibre deposition.</p>
<p>With age, there is an almost inevitable build-up of excessive collagen fibres and other debris left behind after multiple cycles of the repair process, and our muscle and joints become stiff.</p>
<p>The way to minimise this is to keep active in a manner that minimises tearing of tissues and promotes optimal repair of those tissues that do get torn. The strategies for achieving this are:</p>
<p>1) Build up exercise gradually ensuring that tissues are strong enough to resist tearing. Strength building exercises (either body weight or in the gym) are a useful adjunct to aerobic exercise such as running</p>
<p>2) Warm up at the beginning of exercise so that any poorly aligned fibres are gently re-aligned rather than abruptly torn apart creating a new cycle of inflammation.</p>
<p>3) Avoid erratic movements, especially movements that require strength near the limit or your current strength;</p>
<p>4) Massage, foam rolling or gentle stretching to remove knotted fibres can be helpful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not enough Yoga or that Chinese old folks flowing movement dancing they do to Teletubbies music!</p>
<p>u/Angela_white32  covers the how n why very well! Top post.</p>
<p>Seriously once you get past 40 especially if you're active - was MTBing and weight lifting until 45 - you start noticing just how lacking in the range of movement you now have. Women have it worse as their geometry means their knees basically fall apart at any age but past 40 it's not good. I'm male and my knee rehabilitation physio (it went opening a door) was me plus 14 women aged from 15 to 70 the majority were  sub 30 and slim athletic running build which is basically what killed their knees!</p>
<p>Once I realised just how restricted my movement was I knocked weight lifting on the head and took up Yoga. Even beginners Yoga is vicious but I like the challenge and after 6 months whilst I've still got a way to go my range of movement is so far improved it's amazing. </p>
<p>I still cycle as much as possible and since Yoga have upped my I feel comfortable gear by 3 smaller on the rear whilst on the big front cog. When I get to the point I can't do Yoga I'm joining a TellyTubbies dancing class.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Skin, tendons and ligaments become less flexible over time. Part of the &quot;stiff&quot;ness as well is not necessarily because the body won't make the movement, but because it causes pain before you get there. The accumulation of past injuries that aren't properly cared for makes this worse. For example, not going to physical therapy after you injure yourself comes back to bite you later. One of the many sad side effects of the massive up charges the US puts on medical care. I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if people in countries with socialized medicine have this problem to a lesser degree.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
