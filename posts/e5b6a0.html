		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone is right here. But to answer the question more in depth...
A master vinyl is etched using a much heavier etching head that has a tracking system to GO INWARDS at a constant rate. This is reflected In how the vinyl is played back except your needle follows the grooves and so is controlled by the grooves. The speed, 45 or 33 rpm, remains constant during master etching and final playback. Though technically you can (and do) master at lower speeds to improve quality.
So yes the outer tracks move faster and therefore have higher &quot;bandwidth&quot; or fidelity (even though these are different terms, they both apply)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The recording is done at the same speed as the playback so it sounds just fine, but as you get closer to the centre of the record, there's not as much vinyl track per second of music, so the fidelity does drop. </p>
<p>That's why on a lot of records that have been mastered with some thought, the tracks with a brighter sound (more high frequency content) tend to be closer to the outer edge of the record, because it's the high frequencies that become less possible to reproduce as the &quot;inches of track per second of audio&quot; value drops, as it's naturally going to as you get further towards the middle of the record.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
