		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Sun actually <a href="http://apollo.lsc.vsc.edu/classes/met130/notes/chapter2/plank_e_sun.html" target="_blank">emits more light in the green than in any other part of the spectrum</a>, but the net result of this to the human eye is that the colors mix to look white (and then our atmosphere scatters some of that light, making it look yellow). So no, even a star that peaks at green wavelengths will not look green. </p>
<p>All stars have spectra that look sort of like the spectrum in the image I’ve linked above, with the peak in different parts of the spectrum, depending on the star’s temperature. The peaks of hotter stars are more toward the left in that diagram (in the blue, UV, etc.), while cooler stars peak more toward the right (red, infrared, etc.). So hotter stars emit more blue than red and this look bluer. <em>Note that no star is cool enough to peak so far to the right in that diagram as to not emit a significant amount of visible light. Thus, every star is visible to the human eye, provided we are close enough to it that it is not too dim to see. (Some will argue about black dwarfs, but those are cold, dead stellar remnants, not true stars undergoing nuclear fusion.)</em></p>
<p>Also, a star cannot appear black, since there is no combination of colors that appears black. Black is the result when no significant amount of light from the visible spectrum is present. </p>
<p>Edit: added the second paragraph for more information and proved a little bit more clarity. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They form when the radiation of a White Dwarf Star (The core of a star after it has blown off it's layers) cools and no longer emits light on any spectrum, this becoming black in nature. </p>
<p>Now the problem here is that it takes 50+ billions of years for a White Dwarf to get this point and as the estimated age of the universe is 14.7bn years old, none have formed yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think so.
Some stars can appear green due to an optical illusion, but due to stars giving off a black body spectrum of light, they will never appear green. The closest you could get would be our sun, whose spectrum peaks in green wavelengths.
I'm not sure what you mean by a black star.. for something to appear black it needs to not emit any light, which would therefore make it not a star as it wasn't undergoing any fusion, or all of the light is somehow being stopped from escaping. You get brown dwarfs which are those that never got big enough to start fusing Hydrogen (although some can fuse Deuterium and Lithium) and so I suppose these could potentially be what you're thinking could be a black star?
Hope this helps somehow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Regarding black stars, how do we define &quot;star&quot;? If a star has burnt out and essentially has no energy generating nuclear activity would it technically still be a star, or an ex-star? If it is a star then what is the difference between a black star and a very large planet?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
