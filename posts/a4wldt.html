		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The chemistries we see here on earth are least partly due to the physical conditions of our environment: ambient temperature, pressure, etc all constrain the possible chemistries that elements can do (other, more universal properties provide more general constraints, but these should be valid everywhere), so it's possible that if an environment were radically different and stable over a very long period of time, it could lead to the emergence of life with vastly different chemistry than what we observe here on earth. For example, it has been shown that spontaneous membrane formation is possible in the methane-rich environment we think exists on Saturn's Moon, Titan. As far as we know, membranes are essential for life. </p>
<p>The challenge with this idea is that life formed via radically different chemistries than those possible on earth would likely not be observable to us without very specific technology, because we could not exist in the environments it requires (and it could not exist here on earth). For example, the membranes that can likely form on Titan would require the exact same conditions here on earth to exist, and currently those conditions only exist in a computer.</p>
<p>Now, even if we could observe life formed via radically different chemistries, we might not be able to comprehend that it is even alive, because these radically different chemistries might operate on timescales that make no sense to us. Gradual changes caused by life forms like these imaged ones could be too long for us to understand them as being due to living processes vs a geological process, for example.</p>
<p>So, I guess my answer is that yes, radically different chemistries than what we observe here on earth could lead to life elsewhere in the universe, but all of the questions that immediately follow from that answer are deeply fraught. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's okay as a scientist to say that we don't know things. Your question presents one thing that it seems we may not yet know. No answer provided here has any source that verifies whether the answer to your question is yes or no. I can't provide a source that verifies &quot;we don't know&quot; but I will give a recent example of how the conventional wisdom of biological chemistry has stringent rules that are difficult to overcome and would require an understanding of chemistry beyond what anybody is doing right now.</p>
<p>DNA contains nucleic acids chained together by a phosphorous-sugar backbone. DNA is necessary for living organisms because specific traits of the organism must be given to the next generation; with no information, there would be no way for the subsequent generation to grow and function. Phosphorus is considered necessary, yet a recent paper in Science, funded by those at NASA, suggested that perhaps the <a href="https://cen.acs.org/articles/88/i50/Arsenic-Bacteria-Breed-Backlash.html" target="_blank">phosphorus can be substituted with arsenic</a>. However, studies trying to replicate or verify the results have failed. Why? Because it is very unlikely that arsenic can perform the same function as phosphorus as <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cb2000023?src=recsys&amp;journalCode=acbcct" target="_blank">arsenic molecules will fall apart quickly</a>.</p>
<p>So take this into consideration when people talk about other elements possibly being useful. Heavier elements often don't have the same stability or rate of formation, whether it be electronic or steric principles. Though elements down a column on the Periodic Table may function similarly, they are not the same in terms of their reactivity because their electron density is not going to be the same.</p>
<p>I nor anyone else who has a healthy dose of skepticism on non-carbon-based life forms can prove a negative. All we can say is that we don't know since there's still a lot of chemistry left to explore. But remember: we can't even prove that <em>phosphorus</em> is not necessary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simple answer is yes. A number of alternatives to carbon have been proposed such as silicon. But they lack certain features like a good blend of stability and reactivity (silicon, for example, has such a strong affinity for oxygen that silicon dioxide is almost inert). Consider reading up on xenobiology and astrobiology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've read that scientists have considered six different combinations of solvents and macromolecules that could create life.
