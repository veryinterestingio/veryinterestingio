		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dolly the sheep didn't die from cloning related complications, and she lived a long enough life to give birth to 6 lambs. Ultimately she died of lung cancer caused by Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV), a virus that was infecting the rest of her herd. She was euthanized due to the tumors in order to prevent her from suffering.</p>
<p>People often think that because her life was about half of the expected length that cloning must have been responsible, but it turns out she just had some bad luck and got sick. Was she more susceptible because she was cloned? Perhaps, but her non-cloned herd-mates didn't really fare any better, so I don't think so.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, most clones don't make it until birth, and there are numerous explanations, largely depending on how the cloning was undertaken.</p>
<p>Typically, as with your examples, a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_cell_nuclear_transfer" target="_blank">somatic cell nuclear transfer</a> is undertaken. In short, cells are taken from adult animal, the nucleus containing the DNA is carefully scooped out, is then inserted into egg cells, which are finally induced to develop. The trouble is, the DNA you're inserting has already aged, often considerably. Take DNA from a 12-year old sheep and insert it into a sheep egg and you can be said to have a '12-year old sheep egg'. The years only continue piling on after that.</p>
<p>To get into the details, there are two major influencing factors (amongst others):</p>
<p><strong>i) Epigenetics:</strong></p>
<p>We're all reasonably familiar with the basics of DNA. A DNA sequence represents a string of 'letters', or nucleotides, which encodes information - information used by cellular machinery to make stuff. Simple enough. However, on top of this genetic code there lies a secondary layer of annotation, which helps inform the cell when/where/why etc. to use the genetic instructions. This is the epigenetic code.</p>
<p>Think of it a bit like a Word document; the main body of text is your genetic code, and let's say this doesn't really change. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics" target="_blank">Epigenetics</a> is akin to someone reviewing your document, and writing comments, corrections, annotations on the side. And this higher level of annotation changes considerably throughout your lifespan; arguments going back and forth between different reviewers, suggestions written then hastily scribbled out, bits of text highlighted in different colours. A big ol' mess you now have to untangle.</p>
<p>A developing embryo reading this annotation is going to struggle interpreting how it should proceed with understanding the main body of the text. It will do some things a bit early, it will do things a bit late, it might not do some things at all. Extremely few cloned individuals make it to birth for this reason, and those that do often continue to express problematic phenomena such as gene dysregulation, over- or under-expression etc. etc. ever after.</p>
<p>This 'aint no recipe for a healthy animal.</p>
<p><strong>ii) Telomeres:</strong></p>
<p>DNA in cells is typically organised into structures called chromosomes. I mentioned above DNA sequences encode information? Well, that's not <em>quite</em> true. Only a small fraction of your DNA actually does - the rest can have a whole buncha' other 'non-coding' functions.</p>
<p>At the end of your chromosomes, you have a section of some of this non-coding DNA called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere" target="_blank"><strong>telomere</strong></a>. The purpose of this telomere is to act as a buffer during DNA replication, which happens every time your cell divides, in order to protect the rest of your DNA, including all the coding regions, from accidentally being chopped off. Every time your cell divides, a little bit of this telomere is removed instead, until eventually they no longer remain and your cell divisions could start cutting into important coding regions. This is bad.</p>
<p>Embryonic stem cells are capable of preventing this telomere degradation. So, y'know, normal embryos start development with a lovely long pair of telomeres. In a cloned individual, they can often start development with a severely shortened set; and they'll only be getting shorter. As such, many young cloned animals are disproportionately more likely to suffer premature cell line quiescence or self-destruction.</p>
<p>As with a dodgy epigenome, this 'aint exactly great for their health either.</p>
<hr />
<p>More recent advances in cloning technology have meant we can better deal with the above considerations, and we've successfully and sequentially cloned, for example, several generations of mice without any telomere length loss. It tentatively looks like it kinda' depends on which tissue you got your original sample from. Likewise several epigenetic barriers that impede cloning processes are in the process of being overcome.</p>
<p>Cloning is slowly but surely becoming increasingly viable. Maybe we can try again with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrenean_ibex" target="_blank">Pyrenean ibex</a>, who knows?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> To clarify, this was intended as a broad explanation for the difficulties rearing cloned animals to adulthood historically and <em>in general</em>; none of this was written with respect to, nor applied to, Dolly herself, beyond perhaps the tangential fact she was the lucky 1 in 277 attempts that successfully navigated the challenge of epigenetic reprogramming to reach birth. Until, of course, she was unlucky. RIP, gal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>A relatively high proportion of clones also fail to successfully make the transition to extra-uterine life, some harbouring congenital defects, such as observed in the kidney. <strong>For those clones that survive beyond the perinatal period, however, the emerging consensus, supported by the current data, is that they are healthy and seem to age normally.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The study I linked goes in depth into the process. The short version is that the cloning technology might introduce defects that cause congenital defects (low efficiency process) which make the clones incompatible with life. But when everything goes right, there aren't differences in terms of life span between clones the and the donor.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not that it answers the general question, but Dolly died of a lung condition which is common in sheep who are kept indoors. Other (non adult cloned) sheep who lived at the Roslin Institute were infected in the same outbreak</p>
<p>“It was thought that Dolly had shorter telomeres because her DNA came from an adult sheep and the telomeres had not been fully renewed during her development. This could have meant that Dolly was ‘older’ than her actual age. However, extensive health screens on Dolly at the time did not find any conditions which could be directly related to premature or accelerated ageing.“</p>

<p>I guess it remains to be seen if they have the same lifespan as horses produced by sexual reproduction, but polo is a tough sport and these animals have to be close to physically perfect to succeed at an international level like this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
