		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bolt action is simpler and, with fewer things moving around, can be more accurate. They also tend to feed ammunition a little more reliably meaning a wider variety can be used. Mechanical simplicity can mean lower cost and greater durability.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in manufacturing and in firearms industry.  And have done some competitive shooting. </p>
<p>The more basic/simple the design the cheaper it is to make.  So dollar for dollar you can make a more accurate long range rifle as a bolt action.  Reducing variables reduce failure/wear points. </p>
<p>I have very accurate semi auto rifles that will beat most bolt action guns without question,  but are way more costly. Generally if you are hunting you're not planning on many shots, just one good one, so a bolt action is going to work well for you. </p>
<p>This is very generally and you'll find many gun guys could go on for hours about many more points to consider.</p>
<p>However your main question is why do they exist,  it's because they fit the intended use the best.  I build derringers, 2 shot break neck pistols that fit in your palm.  Little to no functional difference  to how they were made over 150 years ago. How else can you buy a brand new easy to conceal firearm for 100usd?  They're not accurate and terribly slow to reload, however having something easily at hand that let's an intruder/thug/rappist/etc... know you have means and are ready to fight back is why many people still buy these guns.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Easier to clean, get less dirty, hand re-loaded ammunition shells can  be tighter tolerances (since you are using your hand to pull out the rounds versus using gas/blowback reactions).  If you use a form-fitted round (previously fired and expanded to *perfectly* fit your chamber, it's pretty tightly in there, and a semi-automatic will sometimes not have the force to eject the form-fitted brass casing after firing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
