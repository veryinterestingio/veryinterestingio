		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hearing scientist here.  This one gets asked in various formats quite a bit (I've answered it a few times).</p>
<p>Basically, everything we hear is a stereo (LR) signal by the time it gets to our ears.  But our ears (and brain) are very good at decoding this to work out position.</p>
<p>In terms of surround sound, etc., the aim is to create a soundscape in the room that is as similar as possible to the real world, from the perspective of the relevant listening position(s).  That is, if you're sitting in just the right spot, the waves arriving at your ears is as close as possible to if that bird was actually real, or if that car really drove past you, etc.  This is done using complicated maths that makes the sound waves from different speakers interfere with each other, adding up of cancelling out in just the right ways.</p>
<p>As for how your ears work out where thing are (real or virtual), there are a few different ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>We can detect tiny differences in arrival time between the ears.  A sound on your left reaches your left ear before your right ear.  This is called the Interaural Time Difference (ITD).</li>
<li>We can detect tiny differences in volume between the ears.  A sound on your left is louder in your left ear than in your right ear (partly due to your head casting a shadow).  This is called the Interaural Level Difference (ILD).</li>
</ol>
<p>Both of these help discriminate left and right, but not front/back or up/down.  If a sound is anywhere on the flat plane between your ears, it'll sound the same to each ear.  So directly in front will arrive simultaneously at L and R, as will directly behind.  So, we also use:</p>
<p>3)  Motion cues.  By moving your head around (which you're constantly doing, even if you're trying not to), you break the symmetry.  Turning left will mean a sound in front of you is now to your right, but a sound behind is to your left.  Tilting to one side or the other breaks the up/down symmetry in a similar way.  We use balance organs in the ears to work out how we're moving, and interpret the apparent motions of sounds.</p>
<p>4)  Spectral cues.  As other have mentioned, the shapes of your <em>pinnae</em> (the flappy bits of your ears) play a role.  These act as filters to different frequencies of sounds depending on location.  For example, a complex sound will sound slightly tinnier (more high end) in front of you, but more bassey (more low end) behind you.</p>
<p>Each of these has its limitations.  ITDs only work for low sounds or complex sounds.  ILDs only work for high sounds.  Motion cues rely on...motion, but also balance.  Spectral cues need to be for complex sounds, preferably higher pitched.  But, together, they mean we are ridiculously good at pinpointing sounds in front of us.  Off at the side, we're not so great, but we can at least turn to face the source.  After all, of a lion is somewhere on your left, you probably don't care too much about a 5° difference!</p>
<p>Edit:  Thanks, kind strangers :)</p>
<p>Edit2: Rule 4 - Don't literally explain to a 5 year old!  But <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/ldzj17/eli5_in_8d_audio_how_is_the_audio_able_to_sound/gm9sr07?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">here</a>'s an attempt anyway!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The term 8D is a marketing gimmick.  It only uses left and right inputs because it is actually just stereo sound, and stereo only uses left and right.</p>
<p>Now, having said that, they can use digital sound mixing technology to manipulate the sound in ways that simply sticking two microphones in front of a band can't.  In a modern recording studio, every instrument and every singer is recorded separately.  So, by adjusting the volume of each singer/instrument in the left and right channel, they can &quot;position&quot; each singer/instrument anywhere along the left/right dimension.</p>
<p>Now, here's where the illusion starts.  Imagine there is a singer in front of, and a bit to the left of you.  Now, when she sings, you will hear her voice in your left ear a little bit before you hear it in your right ear. So far, this is what normal stereo does.  Now, imagine that there is a wall to your left.  What will you hear?  You will hear the singer in your left ear, then the right, then you will hear the echo of the singer as the sound bounces off of the wall, first in your left ear, then your right.</p>
<p>Now imagine a violin player is standing beside the singer (to your right).  The sound from the violin is going to hit your right ear first, then the left.  In this case though, the sound bouncing off the wall is going to hit your left ear first, and then the right.</p>
<p>A computer can easily calculate all of those timings, working out the math of sound in order to place musicians anywhere.  A computer can coordinate the sounds from multiple musicians (and computing the echos off multiple virtual walls) to make it seem like the band is circling around you.  It's basically the same ray tracing math that graphics cards do to compute an image and its reflections, except it's done with sound instead of light.  </p>
<p>However fancy it may be, it's still just stereo, so all it needs is left and right.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very simple and maybe a bit inprecise ELI5-ish answer:</p>
<p>Sound changes on its way to your eardrums, as it hits obstacles etc on its way (head, ears, etc). Your brain then recognized how the sound has changed in order to determine where it came from.</p>
<p>By changing the sound beforehand, the directional “information” can be imitated, tricking your brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you're getting different answers because some people don't know what 8D audio Is (I didn't know about it until I saw this and looked up an example). The top comment is good, but it is answering a different question (it explains why we can detect if a sound is behind or in front of us in REAL LIFE scenarios, not with headphones in, like the &quot;8D&quot; audio). </p>
<p>With headphones on, as far as I'm aware, there's no way you can detect if a sound is behind or in front of you, because you can't turn your head (see the top comment for how this helps in real life).</p>
<p>Instead, it is more like an auditory illusion. Think of it like that optical illusion of the ballerina spinning: some people tend to see it spinning in one direction, others tend to see it spinning the other way. The same thing happens here. The sound is moving from side to side, but your brain wants to interpret it as moving in a circle, so sometimes it sounds like it's in front of you, and other times behind you. But just like in the case with the ballerina, some people might think the sound is moving around you clockwise, and others might think it is going counter clockwise.</p>
<p>So while you might hear the sound as &quot;in front&quot; of you, someone else might hear it as &quot;behind&quot;</p>
<p>Edit: I should say this applies if you're wearing &quot;regular&quot; headphones. If you have headphones that have speakers aimed at different parts of your ear, then it might be possible to simulate sounds being in front/behind, based on the spectral cues mentioned in the top comment by u/TorakMcLaren</p>
<p>Edit #2: I suppose an audio engineer could also simulate the spectral cues (ex. Add bass to sounds to make them sound behind you) but I don't know how effective that would be, since the ability to turn your head is much more important for distinguishing where sounds come from.</p>
<p>In either case, these &quot;8D&quot; audios are almost certainly not doing the things I mentioned in my edits, so the explanation is probably just the auditory illusion</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
