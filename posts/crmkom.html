<p>You can have what’s called a “colicky” pain in the abdomen, this is pain that comes in waves, which is due to peristalsis (the intestines basically contract in waves to help push food) and if there is an irritant in the tract, you will feel the pain on the contraction. </p>
<p>Now, related to this is the fact that nausea is based on the gut brain axis. Your gut actually produces neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin, these communicate with the brain to tell it to vomit. For example, a common drug for nausea is metocloprimide which is a dopamine blocker. </p>
<p>How these neurotransmitters interact from the gut and brain is very complicated and is based on our outside world (like our interpretation of possible anxiety causing scenarios) as well as what’s inside our body (something toxic). </p>
<p>So, I think it is dependent on why you are feeling nausea in the first place. Spit balling now, in my experience, if I have something like food poisoning, I just slowly get more nauseous until a vomit response is trigger. If I’m feeling nauseous from anxiety, well, then likely my brain is trying to combat that nausea with other neurotransmitters or maybe by reducing neurotransmitter receptors in the brain as a way to try and balance the system, if that makes sense. The ladder, I suppose could be like a wave sensation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Proximal answer (how): The neurons that conduct those impulses (the brain of the gut) are all slow and unmyelinated.  They generally control phasic contractions of smooth muscle (as opposed to tonic contractions, like those around resistance arteries that maintain blood pressure).  This is essentially slow pain, type c fibers IIRC.  Similar to the pain you get after being kicked in the testicles, rather than fast pain you get from a needle prick.  </p>
<p>Ultimate answer (why it evolved this way): no idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>MD here. Most of the sensations we experience do t function well as sustained stimulus. If we raise a level of neurotransmitter in a particular distribution for a period of time, eventually we will become desensitized to it. Many bodily functions have cyclical rhythm such as our sleep ale cycles over larger spans of time or our attention span of much shorter duration. When we feel nausea, it should be serving a purpose as all experiences do whether we perceive them
Positively or negatively. Just as pain gives us insight to injury and ongoing process of repair that we may favor our wounds until they heal without reinjury, so does nausea serve a comparable purpose and paradigm. We need to feel nausea so that we do not eat and straight. The system if our stomach is irritated or if our bowel
Is obstructed with compromise of transit of contents. It would be counterproductive to add more food in such s scenarios that whether due to mechanical obstruction, I adequate blood supply, or other factors, the bowel responds well to decompression and rear in these scenarios. Nausea is a status indicator for this process of recovery. If the irritation or obstruction resolves, the nausea eventually abates to let you know the problem is resolved. Additionally it might be useful for the nausea to wane down to test the system periodically even before resolution to still hydrate or replace electrolytes as needed from oral intake historically, though in hospital settings we now manage such things effectively by intravenois corrections. But ultimately if the problem doesn’t fully resolve, we need the wave of nausea to remind us a problem of some kind may persist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
