		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its like getting your hand stamped when going to a fun park with food. You have to buy a ticket, but after you do, they stamp you so they know you've been inside the park. If you wash off the stamp, they'll have to see your ticket again, but with a stamp, you can just show them your hand and be back to riding fun rides super quick. In fact, you can leave the park and come back, show them the stamp, and they'll let you in right away!</p>
<p>edit: please note that this is very simplified. read some of the discussions to get a better grasp of why they do this in the first place, how this can violate privacy, and why that can be a problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First a definition: A cookie is a short piece of data - less than 100 bytes typically - that the server assigned to the browser. Then for each page loaded from the same web site the browsers sends that same cookie value back to the server as a way for the server to say &quot;this is the same browser/person as last time&quot;. This will usually persist as you turn your computer off/on, change internet providers, or just roam between Wifi and cellular in the case of phones.</p>
<p>It's essential for web pages where you can log in with an account so that you stay associated with your account, but any web site can do it for any reason. Some web sites let you have preferences without an account - these are stored in the cookie in some way. Other web sites just give everyone a unique number in a cookie and let the analytics bot have its way with them.</p>
<p>Since this constitutes user tracking there are privacy laws that get involved and this is the disclaimer. It's really picked up since the European GDPR law came into effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You agree to let them put tiny files on your computer that they can later read again.</p>
<p>Normally when your computer talks to a website each new page you open is like the computer talks to the website for the first time.</p>
<p>Imagine having a conversation with a complete amnesiac. </p>
<p>Every time you introduce yourself and start talking to them they immediately forget what you just said and you either have to start over again or live with the fact that amnesiac you are talking to has no idea who you are or what you have been talking with them about.</p>
<p>This sort of works for the sort of stuff the web originally was designed for: Static stuff that is completely anonymous and without context.</p>
<p>It works less well for modern websites where you want to adjust what they show you based on who you are and remember what you have done before and even do stuff like e-commerce in a non stupid way.</p>
<p>You could preface each sentence you say to the amnesiac with your name and where you last where in the conversation, but that gets cumbersome really fast, requires you to remember stuff that ideally the other side should remember and has big security flaw in allowing somebody else to imitate you and pretend they are you.</p>
<p>Cookies are a way to work around the amnesia.</p>
<p>It is like the web-server guy handing you a name badge when you first start talking and asks you to put it on. the badge may contain your name and an identifiable number and some other info, so every time you start talking to the amnesia they look at the badge as you talk to them and immediately remember who you are and may even be able to look up what you said before.</p>
<p>It makes things easier.</p>
<p>Of course there are potential threats too.</p>
<p>Some people may enjoy their anonymity and having a complete stranger slap a name-tag on you as you walk by to track who you are seems rude.</p>
<p>This is why the EU mandate that websites should at least ask people first before they put a tag on them and not just do it without asking first.</p>
<p>A website like reddit needs to use cookies to tag their users and tell them apart, but other websites that you don't really want to remember who you are and build a profile of you and what parts of their website interest you have less of an excuse.</p>
<p>It is balance between being useful to make websites easier and more secure to use and simply tagging users like wildlife to track them  and study their behavior. You may want one but not the other.</p>
<p>Ideally only the websites that put a tag on you can see that tag. So CNN.com does not know what tag Reddit.com has given you, but in practice people have found ways around that. Especially advertisers with their ads on all sorts of sites you visit have an interest in figuring out all sorts of personal stuff about you that you might not want them to know.</p>
<p>In a perfect world we would only let websites put cookies into out browsers when it is necessary to make the site work, but too many websites claim that they need it to work when they really don't in order to invade your privacy.</p>
<p>Even worse big advertisers have found ways around the whole needing a cookie to track you think.</p>
<p>Normally a webserver is not just amnesic, but also completely faceblind. To prosopagnosic amnesiac everyone looks alike and without the cookies they should have no way to figure out who is who. However they do notice certain things about the person they are talking to, like what webbrowser they are using and stuff like that and based of that they might be able to built a profile of everyone they talk to tell people apart without needing cookies.</p>
<p>This is bad if you care about privacy and don't want google to know what weird shit you are into and sell that info to the highest bidder.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
