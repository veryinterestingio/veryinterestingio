<p>This gif probably shows it best. Three double pendulums, starting at almost exactly the same state, will have wildly different speeds and locations only a few seconds in.</p>
<p>Chaos theory, in a nutshell, is the study of how such systems behave, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>When/how fast such systems diverge (for example, the pendulum example is mostly similar for the first few seconds)</li>
<li>When they <em>don't</em> diverge (because many chaotic systems only have regions where it is chaotic; going back to the pendulum, 3 pendulums starting close to the bottom obviously is not chaotic)</li>
<li>How strongly such systems diverge, with respect to differences in the starting condition</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quantum magic aside, if you have 100% knowledge about state of system, you should be able to predict its future using physics. In practice, you never have 100%, you are limited by the accuracy of measurements you can take. Usually, this is good enough. Approximate information about the system allows us to make approximate predictions. For example, we may be able to predict that a cannonball will fly somewhere between 100-110m. We would know the exact number if we knew how every single air particle it hits on its way is behaving, which we don't. But on the whole, it's a useful prediction.</p>
<p>However, if a system is chaotic, predictions based on approximate data will not just be mildly inaccurate, they will be so wildly random they are basically useless. For example, the movement of single grain of sand in a sandstorm. It's so light and surrounded by so many particles of similar size bumping into it, a tiny variation will send it off on a completely different course. It's pointless to even try guessing where it ends up.</p>
<p>Some systems fall somewhere in-between: in short term, we can make reasonably good prediction, but the accuracy steeply falls off with longer-term predictions, until the system becomes completely chaotic. Examples of such systems are weather and the movements of celestial objects.</p>

<p>Edit: u/bluebell_sugarslay raises good points in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/mj70p9/eli5_what_is_chaos_theory_and_what_is_it_used_for/gt97r70/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">his comment</a>. I maintain my example is correct, though, if my explanation is a bit lacking. If we were talking about a single grain riding an invisible predetermined roller-coaster, so to speak, the system would indeed not be chaotic despite its complexity. However, the many grains of sand and air molecules themselves in a sandstorm interact with each other constantly, which I believe does make the system chaotic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chaos theory is the theory that there exist certain mathematical and indeed natural systems that are highly erratic and diverse, to the point where they may seem to be totally random, but are in fact entirely predicted by the underlying equations. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_pendulum" target="_blank">double pendulum</a> is one such system, a <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/2000/001228/full/news001228-2.html" target="_blank">dripping tap</a> is another. </p>
<p>The issue is when such systems exist then an absolutely tiny change to the initial conditions can have massive effects. Two almost identical double pendulums will have completely different motions for example, or the absolute tiniest difference in how tight a tap is closed will be the difference between different drip patterns and indeed whether the pattern is regular or erratic. </p>
<p>Chaos theory has multiple uses. For example most modern cryptography is based upon mathematical processes that produce radically different and thus impossible to guess outcomes but which can be recreated if you have the exact initial conditions. In other words you need a system that looks random but isn't. Which is what Chaos is. Various systems in biology and economics also involve chaotic behaviour: it looks random and is exceptionally difficult to predict, but it is responding to underlying equations, it's just that those equations are highly chaotic.</p>
<p>Finally chaos theory is useful at the interphase between physics and philosophy to explain how our universe can be entirely deterministic (ie the end result of various knowable physical processes) but also contain such diversity and unpredictability. Tiny changes in the initial condition of different parts of the big bang can produce all the diversity that is the universe we see. And combine chaos theory and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle" target="_blank">Heisenberg's uncertainty theory</a> which holds that it is impossible to perfectly measure the initial conditions, because on a quantum level you change the conditions by trying to measure them, and what you're left with is an explanation of how the universe can be completely impossible to predict, and yet fully explained by laws that we understand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is used mostly in mathematics to explain systems that are highly sensible to early conditions. Imagine throwing a marble from the exact same point 1 million times. The conditions of air resistance and other variables will change the course of the marble every time. Chaos theory is just that, scenarios that by having just slight early changes lead to completly different outcomes. Its studied because it can help us understand aerodynamics and particule movement more precisely</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I recently had to explain this to my 10 year-old as we received a chaos engine from Kiwicrate. </p>
<p>What I said was the idea behind chaos theory is the tiniest, unknowable variations at the start of a process can magnify until they have massive consequences at the end. Having the chaos engine I could demonstrate that even if we held the arms in what looked like exactly the same way we'd never be able to replicate the shapes it made thanks to tiny variations in weight distribution, even air currents and bearing heat etc. She loved it. </p>
