		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesnt stain things.  It just leaves a residue of anything that was dissolved in it as it evaporates.    Pure (distilled) water doesnt do that.   The water we drink isnt pure (even when its purified) it has minerals dissolved in it.   Ive heard drinking distilled water isnt good for you.  Ive got a few bottles for my humidor (its exepensive and comes from a pharmacy) and it doesnt taste good at all</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There might be a couple methods at play here but the two I'm thinking of are polarity and impurity. Water is a polar molecule. One side has a slightly positive charge and the other is slightly negative because of the relative locations of the hydrogen and oxygen atoms in the molecule. This polarity helps water act a solvent. Even though it has no pigment, things inside a fabric <em>do</em> and they're soluble. When water evaporates, those dissolved molecules come out of solution and are re-deposited on the fibers of your fabric at the perimeter of the water stain, and at different rates, depending on the particular chemicals. The other method is impurity. Water has all sorts of stuff in it and some of that can interact with the fabric and alter is color profile a little bit. </p>
<p>A great example would be lined paper. Water won't change the color of paper but if you get a droplet on a line, the ink dissolves, diffuses through the paper, and when the water dries you end up with a big smeared spot where there used to be a nice crisp line.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
