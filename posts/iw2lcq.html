		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see a little gap in what people are saying, so I'll try to explain the process of &quot;hard-wiring&quot; others are mentioning in a simple way:</p>
<p>When the embryo is just a couple of cells, the DNA is being read by a long process that eventually works as like an instruction manual on how to build all sorts of different proteins. Proteins do everything and anything kinda, so they can act as signal molecules that tell all the cells how to develop and such ie there are cells that give off more of a certain protein that tell the cells around them to start making arms, legs etc. In the process of building a body from scratch, these proteins also dictate how the brain works, and what chemical stimuli the brain should respond to. One of those signals is the light from the moon, or tragically, light posts, flashlights, etc. The light hits their eyes and sends chemical/electrical signals to the brain which is primed to send the turtle in that direction (whether or not that's the ocean) at that early(ish) stage in the brain's development.</p>
<p>Edit: For those asking for more details and/or a more authoritative or generalized explanation of some of this, u/PotatoBasedRobot shared <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/irxncu/how_does_a_cell_know_what_to_become_if_they_all/g54ffw9?context=3" target="_blank">this</a> link to another reddit comment I found to be informative and clearly written.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Responses to certain stimuli are &quot;hard-wired&quot;. This happens in humans too. Genetics guides how pathways develop in the brain (idk if this is even well understood yet, lots of brain stuff is poorly understood and a lot of theories about even well known neurological diseases are just educated guesses). </p>
<p>Take a cat for example. They naturally develop a response to certain movements indicative of prey. Nobody taught them that. Just put a prey-like thing in their field of view and they will reflexively look at it and you can see their pupils reflexively dilate too. The turtles are likely hard-wired to follow the light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don’t follow the moon. They follow light. It’s just that moonlight reflects off the ocean really well.</p>
<p>There’s a problem here in that now there are other light sources- namely cities. So you’ll get baby turtles following lights across busy streets instead of going down to the ocean.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The instinct they have is &quot;move toward the light&quot;.  When they hatch the moon shines off the ocean and that direction is brighter than the darkness of plants and dunes at night.  The light is attractive and they move toward it.  Moving toward light is one of the simplest possible instincts, even plants can do it...heck even some single cell organisms do it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Daniel Dennett discusses the analogous behaviour of frogs eating flies to illustrate the (under)determination of meaning. In brief, it seems that frogs don't really see flies; they just detect black blurs moving in front of them. But changes in circumstances (such as an invasive species of fly arriving) cause adaptive responses in frogs, so changes in meaning emerge (not in individuals but across the species) as nature selects the optimal fly detectors. If sea turtles don't go extinct too quickly, we will see a similar recalibration of their instincts, as meaning and function distinguish between moonlight and boardwalks. (See Intuition Pumps, ch. 47.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
