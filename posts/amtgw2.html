<p>You're actually a bit mistaken. Gold IS toxic to us, and can cause heavy metal poisoning. It's just that in it's solid state it's extremely stable/nonreactive and is hard to absorb into the body. This type of poisoning was featured on an episode of house. You generally have to eat a salt of gold very often to get the poisoning.</p>
<p>As for why gold is so non-reactive? Well in chemistry orbitals that are full or half full are very stable. Gold has a fully filled outer D shell, and a half filled outer S shell. The D orbitals steal an electron from the S orbitals so you end up with a full shell and a half full shell. That makes it pretty non-reactive. </p>
<p>Mercury, on the other hand, being a liquid is easily absorbed into your body (especially as an organometallic compound) and will also kill you via heavy metal poisoning. Mercury isn't actually all that reactive, I'd say it's pretty average on the &quot;reactivity&quot; scale. Other elements (such as the alkali metals or halogens) are much... much more reactive. </p>
<p>TL:DR: Both gold and mercury will kill you via similar mechanisms, mercury is just MUCH more easily absorbed by your body through your skin and more easily exists in gaseous form for you to breathe in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It changes the electronic properties of the element. Gold and Mercury exhibit relativistic effects in their electron orbitals. In gold this results in a colour change, in mercury it results in the inter atomic bonding being weaker.</p>
<p>In mercury the 6s2 orbital is contracted relative to the 5d10 so there is not a significant amount of electron density of high enough energy (compared to the next orbitals down) to contribute to metallic bonding so van der Walls dominates. Think of it like sanding down the studs on Lego bricks and trying to build a strong interlocking structure. This is also why mercury is a poor conductor, not enough of a contribution of the 6s2 orbital to the conductance band. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
