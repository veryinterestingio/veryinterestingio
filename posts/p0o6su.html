		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The white steam in bathrooms is actually a condensed liquid mist.  It forms because the air in the bathroom is <em>cooler</em> than the air in the shower.</p>
<p>How did the water vapor get in the air in the first place?  Hot water evaporates.  Air that is 40 C (104 F) can hold up to 5.5% water.  While more room temperature air 25 C (77 F) can “only” hold 3.1% water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water doesn’t need heat to evaporate, it just speeds it up. As long as water is in a liquid state and exposed to air, it’s evaporating. You never see a puddle boiling (hopefully) but you see it evaporate over a few days. Your shower is still warm enough that there will be quite a bit more evaporation happening than if you were just running a cold sink. And like the other commentor said, the colder air makes it condensate where you can see it. It’s like fog, or a cloud.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Boiling is when molecules <em>inside</em> a liquid start turning to gas.  Evaporation is when molecules <em>on the surface</em> of a liquid start turning to gas.  Liquids can only boil when heated to their boiling point, but can evaporate at any temperature (although they'll evaporate faster when hotter).</p>
<p>When you're showering, the water coming from your shower head has a lot of surface area per unit volume, and has probably been heated to be at least a bit warmer than room temperature, so you get more evaporation than you would from a similar quantity of water that was just sitting around in a puddle or a bucket.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some small number of liquid water things are always moving fast enough to exit the liquid and turn into a gas. Most of the water things aren't moving fast enough so they stay liquid instead.  The number that can turn into gas goes up as the water gets hotter.  But sometimes those gas molecules can stick to dust in the air, and that's what makes the fog. More water can stick the cooler the air is. You can see the same thing happen with a cold mirror and a hot shower.  This also happens more with showers than baths because more of the water is in the edges of the shower drops than normally would be on the top of the bath, so even at the same temperature water overall can turn into a gas faster from a shower than a bath.</p>
<p>At 100 C there are so many water things moving fast enough to turn into gas that many of them turn into gas all at once, which is why water in a pot can boil.  But if there's no heat still going into the water, the water left behind gets colder. That's why when you take a billing pot off a burner it quickly stops boiling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A question in return: why do clothes dry out on a clothesline on a windless day? Sun surely doesn't heat it enough.</p>
<p>Consider a glass of water, and a spoonful of salt. Salt is solid, but you can dissolve it in the water, turning it liquid. There's a limit of how much you can dissolve; any further just won't do anything (otherwise such beautiful sights as <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamukkale" target="_blank">Pamukkale</a> in Turkey could not exist). It's not very obvious but the hotter water is, the more you can dissolve in it. Finally, if there's dissolved salt and you change something so that it's more than water can handle, the extra will crystalise. In case of water being cooled, some of it will coat the bottom of the glass - or more commonly, if you boil the water, you'll end up with nothing but residue soon enough. Finally, note that dissolving did not require reaching a melting point for salt.</p>
<p>Now all we did was a solid dissolved in liquid. But all the same things happen one state up - liquids in gas. Water evaporates (dissolves) in air given the chance. There's a limit of how much water air can handle - the measure of how much it's holding is known as humidity. The hotter air is, the more water it can hold; hence why saunas can be so damp, and why cold winter air (~0°F) feels dry; because it literally is, very little water vapour can exist in the cold. If air cools, excess water will coalesce back into liquid: fog/mist if it has no surface, or the steamed mirror covered in water 'residue' (which in reality is a thin layer of water droplets; their shape scatters light and makes reflection blurry). In winter, this makes your breath visible as humid air from your lungs rapidly cools and can no longer hold the water in gaseous form. Finally, note that evaporating water did not require reacing boiling point for water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
