		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple of things at play here. One is that your body manages vitamins differently depending on whether or not they are fat soluble. Vitamins A,D,E, and K are the common fat soluble vitamins. Since these can be stored in fat, they can be stored for a longer period of time and you can consume more of them at once but less often and be just fine. If you have ever heard about high dose vitamin D supplements that are taken once a month instead of lower dose daily, it’s because of this principle. The fat solubility allows you to hang onto the vitamin because there is an area for it to be stored (fat tissue). </p>
<p>Other vitamins, such as Vitamin C, are what are known as water soluble. Because water is pretty mobile in the body, it’s hard for the body to hang onto these type of vitamins (water soluble) long term without having them get flushed out of your system. This is what you are describing above where vitamins are discarded by the body when there are more than are needed. It’s not really a choice, there just isn’t a good way to store them longer term. </p>
<p>Finally, the salt and bacon part. So in the short term yes, your body will hang onto extra salt for a few hours or a day. This is because when you eat a lot of salt your body/kidneys can sense the increased concentration. In order to keep the water and salt balance just right, your body then sends signals to hold onto more water, thereby lowering the ratio of salt to water. This increase in water retention is why sometimes people can feel a bit bloated after a really salty meal. Over the next day or so though, the body can compensate and get rid of the salt and water through adjusting the concentration of the urine appropriately. The system actually works amazingly well overall, it just has trouble with the chronically high levels of salt that are consumed eating the “modern” diet.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's not entirely true. Too much of anything is a bad thing. This applies to vitamins as well. Vitamins A,D,E,K are fat soluble which means you can end up getting complications from having too much of the same over time. It has been reported that eating a polar bear's liver could kill you because it contains an extremely high concentration of vitamin <strong>A</strong>. Ingesting the <strong>liver can</strong> cause vitamin <strong>A</strong> poisoning known as acute hypervitaminosis <strong>A</strong>. This results in vomiting, hair loss, bone damage and even death.</p>
<p>Vitamins B,C are water soluble so they are more easily flushed from the system. Even then, megadoses of Vitamins B and C can lead to complications as well. </p>
<p>A slice of Bacon has around 220mg of sodium. A pack of bacon would have around 20 slices which equals 4400mg of sodium. More than twice your daily requirement. Regular high sodium diet leads to fluid retention causing the feeling of bloating. Fluid retention could lead to higher blood pressure causing your heart to have to work a lot harder. A harder working heart can cause damage to blood vessels and the heart muscle itself which in turn leads to stroke, heart attacks etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That isnt true.</p>
<p>Vitamin D poisoning exists.</p>
<p>There is a difference between a small overdose that the body can filter out, and saturating the body to the extent that it cannot flush out the excess before it starts to destroy your organs. Take enough of anything and you will die, be it vitamins, minerals, water, you name it.</p>
<p>(Also, Sodium isn't a vitamin, it is a mineral when in a compound :-) )</p>
<p>(Edit: as mentioned, it varies on the chemical too)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
