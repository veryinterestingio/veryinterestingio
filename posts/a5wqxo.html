		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cell is an oily bubble with an inside and outside. In nerve cells, there's a fat end with the fiddly bits of the cell, and a long tail extending from it (called an axon). There's basically salt water on both the inside and outside, but the inside has the bits that are the cell, and the outside is the bits outside the cell (like other cells).</p>
<p>Salt water is water with salt. Salt is made up of a positively charged part and a negatively charged part. For example, table salt is Na (sodium),  which has a positive charge, and Cl  (chlorine) which has a negative charge. When dissolved in water, positive and negative bits move around separately.</p>
<p>Nerve cells have little pores made out of protein that poke through the fat bubble (cell membrane) so that they touch either side. These proteins act as little gates and push the positively charged bits from the inside to the outside. This means that there's a difference between inside and outside, with outside having more positive bits, and the inside having more negative bits -- kind of like the + and - ends of a battery. We call that difference an &quot;electrical potential&quot;.</p>
<p>At some point, the main part of the cell sends a chemical signal that triggers the gates to open wide and let the positive charge back inside to mix with the negative again. That starts at the fat end of the cell and works its way down the tail bit -- and that's an impulse. When that happens, it knocks off neurotransmitters at the end of the cell  and if they touch an adjacent nerve cell, that can trigger that adjacent cell to cut loose too. A whole bunch of these cells bunch together to form a nerve, and when they all fire off at once, we call that a nerve impulse, and you can use electrical equipment to follow the movement of the charge in the nerve.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are pumps and gates in your cell membranes, which control the flow of ions. Ions are charged particles (positive or negative), so their movement creates a current and thus electrical impulses.</p>
<p>One example of a pump is the sodium-potassium pump. This pump exchanges 3 Na+ (soidum) ions for 2 K+ (potassium) ions, making the cell lose 1 positive ion each time. This makes the cell more and more negatively charged over time. This effect is slow-ish and mostly constant.</p>
<p>Now we come to the gates. These have a “threshold”, like a plug in a broken dam holding back the water. Once the threshold limit is crossed, everything just bursts through.</p>
<p>In the sodium-potassium example, the sodium gate will open when the cell reaches a certain threshold of negative charge, which will instantly draw the sodium from outside the cell back into the cell to balance the concentration lost by the pump. This causes a massive shift of ions, creating an electrical impulse.</p>
<p>The electrical impulse can also trigger other gates in neighbouring cells to open, causing a “cascade” where the first signal spreads out and travels down the nerves to muscle cells.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Positive little particles like to go to space full of negative little particles.
The Brain cells have the power to create a space full of positive particles (out of the cell) and a place with less positive particles (creating a negative space inside the cell). These spaces are separated by a wall called the cell membrane. When the cell is stimulated by something there are tiny doors throughout the wall that get open and allow the movement of positive particles to the inside of the cell creating an electric charge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In your body you have little power plant workers (ions) some of whom are more positive than others and others who are less positive or even negative! When there are more positive workers than negative workers in the power plant (neurons) the whole power plant begins to work and becomes a huge positive place to work. </p>
<p>They send some of this positivity to the power plants (neurons) nearby which then also become positive. It's contagious and soon all of the factories in a chain become positive which eventually gets electricity to the town (muscles, organs, etc.) and activates them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
