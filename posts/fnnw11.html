		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Picking at scabs and other skin abnormalities actually releases reward endorphines related to our self-cleaning reward system. </p>
<p>Cleanliness is an evolutionary trait because it reduces the risk of infections and reduces the spread of disease, which directly impacts our ability to reproduce in a very positive way. Picking at scabs, scars, and other minor skin irritations is similar enough to picking off ticks/parasites/dirt/etc that it triggers our cleanliness response. </p>
<p>It's also a <strong>displacement activity</strong>, which is the fancy term for &quot;something that staves off boredom/relieves stress but does little else&quot;.</p>
<p>So long as the behavior doesn't become obsessive or harmful (excessive picking), there's really no downside to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>New skin growth can also cause itchiness. As collagen cells expand and new skin begins to grow on the wound, it results in a scab. When a scab is dry and crusty, it stimulates an itchy sensation.</p>
<p>These  messages of itchiness from your brain are ones that you should ignore.  Scratching a wounded area or picking at a scab can tear new skin cells  that your body is producing to heal the wound. Scratching the itch can reinjure the wound and set back the healing process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't help myself. If I feel any kind of bump on my skin, I feel the almost uncontrollable urge to pick at it.  Even someone else's, so it's not a pain or feeling on my own body. If I scratch someone's back and there is a bump, I'm going to scratch it if I don't stop myself or get yelled at</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Havent read many comments yet, so I'm not sure if this specifically has been mentioned, but I'm someone who suffers from dermatillomania and trichotillomania. These disorders are classified as BFRB's (body focused repetitive behaviors) Did you know that a lot of people with BFRB's aren't diagnosed because its written off as a bad habit? Now you know!  </p>
<p>Basically, I compulsively pick at scabs and hair. For me personally, the sensation of plucking hair and scabs is extremely enjoyable, and is akin to stimming, as it originated as a way of relieving stress (bad coping mechanism tbh). As plucking hair and picking at injuries releases endorphins, it's like a drug to me, and something I think about CONSTANTLY. I literally crave the sensation of plucking hair.  </p>
<p>For some people, I can assure you it's likely BFRB related, but skin picking can also just be an activity that's done out of boredom (Displacement activities). It's something that has a high payoff (endorphins) for minimal effort (pick at skin)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
