<p>That's why some trainers ask people who have lost some weight to carry that same weight in a backpack for a mile: just to realize how much was weighing them down is eye-opening and helps them keeping the extra pounds away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer your question, yeah they usually are a lot stronger. </p>
<p>But keep in mind that your lungs don't get any bigger; moving more weight means exerting more energy, which means more oxygen demand. So while fat people are generally pretty strong, they don't have the same level of endurance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fat guy here, and in addition to what other people have said, I just want to point out that when we talk about how muscular someone is, we are often thinking about body parts that have relatively little to do with moving around. It's not like my upper body has much to do with moving around, and how much muscle there is up there primarily depends on my exercise routine and not my daily life. On the other hand, my legs have a lot more muscle, especially my thighs, because that is what I'm moving around with, and if you put me on a leg press machine, I can do a lot more weight than the average person. But thighs tend to be the least visible part of a person's body, and someone who is overweight may also have an extra layer of fat on them, so you may not even realize that they are particularly muscular there. Also, even then, if someone doesn't spend much time standing or walking, there's nothing to say they will have much extra muscle even from that. If your life is bed, office chair, couch, bed, you're not moving around much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
