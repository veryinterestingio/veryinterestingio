		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These are two different ways in which we move our eyes. </p>
<p>The first is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_pursuit" target="_blank">smooth pursuit</a> and is primarily driven by visual motion (which is why it's hard to do in the absence of a moving target). It is the slow rotation of the eye to keep an object on the fovea (highest packing of cones --&gt; greatest detail/resolution) to minimize blur. </p>
<p>The second is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade" target="_blank">saccade</a> which is a discrete movement (i.e. sudden change in orientation) of the eye to focus on a new location. Such eye movements are location-based (as opposed to movement-based). Saccades are the typical way in which we move our eyes and we normally make several saccades per second unconsciously to foveate (move eyes so light from target location falls on the fovea) different parts of the world. We can of course also move our eyes consciously in this manner as when we fixate on some new location. This allows us to see different areas in high resolution. We also move our eyes because if they were stabilized, the receptors would habituate and we would just see a uniform field. <a href="http://psylux.psych.tu-dresden.de/i1/kaw/diverses%20Material/www.illusionworks.com/assets/duplicate1/fi1.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a> is an example of this. Stare at the little black dot and try very hard <em>not</em> to move your eyes (this is actually quite difficult -- those little movements that your eyes are making involuntarily are saccades!). After a second or two, the gray area will start to fade into the background.</p>
<p>Traditionally (<a href="https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1113/jphysiol.1961.sp006811" target="_blank">Rashbass, 1961</a> &lt;- great name!), it has been thought that these are two different pathways / mechanisms, although recently, some have been arguing that there's a single underlying functional mechanism (Krauzlis <a href="https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jn.00801.2003" target="_blank">2004</a>, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1073858404271196?casa_token=zu99-soAj1MAAAAA:4YXFf5XJlxjkg1TXOOoZPU7UUR9zk5jUmEn-Kd7bjHP1Q5_AZ60r53m3Ql6A4fKyeJmFgLmQScmmrKo" target="_blank">2005</a> &lt;- pdfs!). </p>
<p>And yes, you can train yourself to engage in smooth pursuit in the absence of a target (<a href="https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jn.00869.2002" target="_blank">Madelain and Krauzlis, 2003</a> &lt;- pdf!). (This perhaps isn't the best example because here observers start with a visible moving target which disappears and then reappears at a later time. With training, they are able to smoothly pursue the target while it is invisible for longer and longer durations.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
