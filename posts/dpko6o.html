		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How porous and rough it is.</p>
<p>Glass, very smooth paint, metal, plastic, all can be erased. On the opposite side, paper is too absorbent and brushed-on paint is too rough for the eraser to get into all the nooks and crannies.</p>
<p>As an example, I worked at a tutoring center where you could write on the tables. Had these super-slick tables that were basically a whiteboard with legs. Center director tried painting this new non-whiteboard table with a special paint, but he used a brush, and the final result perserved the brush strokes, making it unusable.</p>
<p>Looks like most whiteboards are made with a top coat of melamine (type of plastic), glass, paint, or porcelein.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dry erase markers work by leaving a still-wet residue on the surface of an object. If the surface is too porous (such as paper), it'll get absorbed and bleed through, but since it's not on the very top layer, it's there forever.</p>
<p>Most whiteboards are made with melamine, which keeps the board smooth allowing it to be erasable. It also turns the board white.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>several years ago, my office whiteboard had been used so much (and erased with inappropriate materials like paper towels &amp; windex instead of an actual dry erase eraser, etc) that the surface had roughened up and dry erase markers wouldn't erase any more without something like Windex.  It was a permanent whiteboard at this point.</p>
<p>I had recently bought a new bottle of Rain-X to keep my car windshield clean.  Rain-X is a hydrophobic coating that fills in micropits &amp; scratches on your windshield so it smooths out the glass surface and essentially makes rainwater bead up and run off the windshield.  If you're going anywhere above 30mph or so, you don't even need to run your wipers because the water just runs off the window.</p>
<p>So I figured &quot;This stuff would be perfect for my whiteboard - it'd smooth out the roughness and basically refresh the plastic coating on it!&quot; - so I applied the Rain-X to my whiteboard.</p>
<p>It worked PERFECTLY.  TOO perfectly.  It made the dry erase ink bead up and just... melt away.  You could draw a line across the board and watch the ink absolutely disappear about 2 inches behind your pen as you drew.</p>
<p>My whiteboard went from unerasable to unwriteable.  As such it was totally unusable!!  That rain-X just wouldn't come off either - it stayed unusable until I moved offices a couple of years later and as far as I know, it's still an unwriteable whiteboard :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dry erase board manufacturer here... Low quality dry erase surfaces at some point will wear down to a point where the ink cannot be removed from the surface which is called ghosting. There are many surfaces of low quality that will eventually ghost include melamine, dry erase paints, dry erase laminates, painted steel, dry erase vinyls and more. The highest quality surfaces used for dry erase are porcelain enamel steel &amp; tempered glass. Both surfaces are fired at temperatures over 1400 degrees &amp; have varying gloss levels. The higher the gloss, the better dry erase functionality. The surfaces should never ghost unless they are scratched/damaged. This is why they offer a forever warranty for porcelain enamel steel. Functionally, glass is an equal for dry erase performance but here are a few negatives: normal magnets cannot be used, only rare earth, the glass can be broken and costs over 5x more than porcelain steel boards. Both surfaces can also be ruined with Simple Green or any wood furniture polish. Those products will permanently in-fill the pores of the surface and cannot be removed. The ink smears forever. Even some &quot;dry erase cleaners&quot; can leave a residue. Just use a basic window (glass) cleaner that has no additional features like &quot;streak free&quot;, etc</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Roughness, porosity, hydrophobicity.  Many surfaces have microscopic holes or grooves that will trap the ink, making it very difficult to remove.  Almost any surface that is smooth enough can be cleaned with alcohol, but dry erase boards (especially new ones) have the advantage of being both very smooth, and being hydrophobic enough that the ink never gets properly attached.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
