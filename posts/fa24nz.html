The vaccine acts as a practice run of sorts.</p>
<p>What exactly is it that stops us from just getting a sample of the virus and, say, irradiating it with x-rays or dunking it in some sort of “virus-killer” chemical (if such a thing exists)? Do we have to figure out how to weaken each virus on a case-by-case basis?</p>
<p>I know there obviously must be some reason, and it’s not as simple as just <em>bake virus for 15 minutes, until golden brown</em>. Otherwise disease just wouldn’t be an issue, and that’s obviously not the case. I’m wondering what makes it so hard.</p>
<p>Edit: Thank you for the answers everyone! To sum things up: it’s complicated! (Who knew?) But it basically comes down to a whole host of biological factors that I now have a very vague grasp on but am not qualified to summarize (see comments if you want competent biological information), plus a bunch of administrative hurdles.</p></div></div>

<p>Some viruses are not really good targets for vaccines because they are too variable and mutate too quickly. This is the case for Hepatitis C and HIV to an extent (although there are other difficulties with HIV).</p>
<p>Also, most vaccines today are not killed or live-attenuated pathogens, but conjugated antigen or toxoid vaccines. These eliminate the risk of infection but require you to identify a unique and stable antigen associated with the virus/bacteria and biochemically engineer a complicated molecule to elicit an immune response in vivo.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I run clinical trials for a living at a major cancer center in the United States.  Firstly you need to provide evidence that your vaccine works in culture  and if possible animal models.  Then you need to submit to the FDA for an IND exemption.  Once you complete that process which from start to finish can take months/years, only then can you start clinical trials in humans.  These start at Phase I (very limited only for safety), Phase II tests efficacy, followed by Phase III large scale trial in thousands of people.   Then after all of that is complete and analyzed and only then can it be approved for use in regular medical practice in humans.  At any point in the process there can be setbacks that can take years to fix.  18 months is a ridiculously short time frame, I wouldn’t bet on that actually happening.  In theory if everything works at every step it could be possible but with very long odds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a specialist, but from my understanding:</p>
<p>We need to figure out what part of the virus our immune system will reliably react to, <em>without</em> including something dangerous. We don't just inject the entire virus, but rather a specific piece cut off from the rest.</p>
<p>Traditionally, that meant cutting the DNA up, splitting the different pieces, and then testing each one. These days, we're moving to a new approach where we just share the genetic code and build the pieces (so researchers don't need their own samples of the actual virus).</p>
<p>Once all of that's done - clinical trials take time. Prove it's safe among a few people, then also prove it probably works. Once we know those two things, you then need a big enough outbreak in the general population to test it at the population level. Only then do we have a fully developed vaccine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Safety is partly although I think that’s mostly settled for some types of vaccines. I’ll touch on inactivated viral vaccines.</p>
<p>The bigger issue is manufacturing quality control. It’s a non-ideal process that involves laboriously infecting cells with virus them harvesting that virus then doing it over and over while maintaining the same purity, safety and activity profile. This is why the flu vaccine is determined well before fu season starts and why the CDC doesn’t change the composition mid-year to be more effective. Then for new vaccines once you have a manufacturing process you go into clinical trials, which means first you have to develop a chemical formulation (plus guidelines how do you store it and such) then then you have to accumulate sometimes years of data on stability.</p>
<p>It’s incredibly complex and I’m not doing it justice with my description. So please don’t sow vote me too badly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good question! Not an easy thing to answer with any degree of brevity though. I've given it a good old college try, and I hope it helps clarify things some. Full disclosure -- I'm currently finishing my honors undergraduate degree in immunology and infection. While I'm sure some folks with a bit more education behind them can give a more in-depth answer, I hope my overview helped! If you (or anyone else for that matter) has any questions to specific things I talked about, feel free to ask questions and I'll do my best at answering them. </p>
<p>Vaccines are a way of programming our immune system to react in a specific way against pathogens (bacterial or viral). They help our body's immune system to learn what a specific pathogen &quot;looks like&quot; so to speak and facilitate generation of memory immune cells that can rapidly respond against the pathogenic agent when exposed. In order to understand why they take so long to develop, needless to say a background in immunology helps a lot. As such, I'm going to give you a crash course in how the immune system works in order to answer your question. While a bit wordy, I hope it helps.  </p>
<p>Our immune system is divided into two main branches: innate immunity, and adaptive immunity (the branch we stimulate with vaccines). Innate immunity is nonspecific; it encompasses immune cells (called leukocytes) that don't have immunological memory and results in immune responses against things which leukocytes are programmed to detect as foreign or what our bodies see as 'non-self' -- exogenous material that is not native to our bodies (e.g. proteins that are not expressed by our cells and only by bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc.). Our cells express a lot of proteins and surface markers that are used by other body and immune cells to signal that &quot;we're one of you, please don't kill me&quot;. Bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc. on the other hand don't have this luxury -- they lack these cell surface proteins and are rapidly detected as foreign. When our immune system sees something that it recognizes as foreign or non-self, it responds immediately (within seconds and minutes to hours post infection) and tries to eliminate whatever it is through initiation of an innate immune response. If the innate immune system fails to prevent a pathogen from establishing (e.g. the infecting bacteria or virus evades immune detection and is still actively replicating inside us), adaptive immunity kicks in. </p>
<p>The adaptive immune system is highly specific; it is comprised of highly specialized cells called lymphocytes that are tailored against a specific pathogen. The main types of lymphocytes pertinent to this discussion are B lymphocytes (which produce soluble molecules called antibodies which bind to pathogens), and T lymphocytes (which kill infected cells and help modulate other immune cells). These guys are pretty potent, and generally speaking pretty good at their job at clearing infections that are dragging on before the pathogen kills you. The main reason these bad boys don’t get involved immediately is because they take anywhere from 2-5 days post injury to become active and get online and involved. During an infection, some innate leukocytes that are constantly fighting the resident infection will process the pathogen into things called antigens and mount them on their cell surface (on things called MHC complexes). These cells, bearing the bodies of their enemies, migrate to lymph nodes where they proudly present them to resident, non-active B and T lymphocytes. Each B/T lymphocyte is characterized by slightly different cell surface receptor (B cells have B-cell receptors, T cells have T cell receptors) which recognize different targets on a pathogen. In the context of say, a viral infection (e.g. HIV), you want to activate B and T lymphocytes which can recognize HIV virus antigens -- lymphocytes which cannot do so would be useless if activated and a waste of time and body resources. As such, the innate leukocytes that are wearing antigens from processed pathogen on their cell surfaces literally go cell-to-cell showing their chunks of viral antigens to lymphocytes and ask, &quot;do you recognize this?&quot; If yes, then the lymphocytes become activated and start proliferating and initiate an adaptive immune response. If they don't, the innate cell moves to the neighbor and keeps on searching until it finds a cell that does. After an infection is resolved, from the adaptive immune lymphocytes that were activated we get a small pool of memory cells (which can be short or long-lived) which remain inactive and circulate through our bodies until they see whatever pathogen initially led to their activation. Once they see the pathogen again, they immediately reactivate and initiate a stronger and faster adaptive immune response than you would get if you were seeing the pathogen for the first time. </p>
<p>Vaccines themselves come in a variety of shapes and forms. While not an exhaustive list, vaccines can use (A) inactivated/dead versions of pathogens (e.g. formalin-inactivated viruses), (B) live, weakened &quot;attenuated&quot; pathogens (e.g. viruses which are mutated to not cause disease, but can still initiate a robust immune response), or (C) constitute a single pathogen protein (e.g. a bacterial toxins like pertussis toxin, or viral like particles used in yearly influenza vaccines). One thing I'd like to point out is vaccines don't solely exist to stimulate antibody protection -- for pathogens which infect cells (e.g. viruses like Hepatitis B), you need to stimulate lymphocytes which can recognize and kill infected cells. While stimulating B cells which produce antibodies may help, they won't result in pathogen clearance. Good vaccines have three main features:
(1) they should be effective at preventing infection via inducing the required immune response for that particular infection, (2) they should be safe, and (3) there needs to be an achievable delivery strategy to get your vaccine to the population that you want to vaccinate. </p>
<p>With respect to getting a sample and inactivating them, that could work in theory, but in practice not so much. Viruses in particular are a bit tricksy in this regard. Even if you mount an immune response against a inactivated virus (treated with &quot;virus-killer&quot; chemicals such as formalin), your body might mount a response against viral protein X, while your neighbor might mount an immune response against viral protein Y. Both are present in the vaccine you and your neighbor took, but you responded against protein X, and your neighbor protein Y. As such, there is no consistency in terms of immunological protection between you and your neighbor, and that lack of consistency is just a tad problematic if you are trying to make something which generates a protective response in almost everyone you vaccinate. </p>
<p>Vaccine development is a long, arduous, expensive road. The first thing scientists need to do is identify something which they think might be protective if your body responds against it. For instance, does the bacteria you want to vaccinate against produce a toxin? Does a virus have an envelope protein which is needed for its life cycle? Typically speaking, first we try to identify components which are protective and relatively constant for the pathogen in question (e.g. a structure or protein which they can't easily change). This is easier said than done.</p>
<p>Let say for simplicity sake that we identify protein X as a possible target. From there, you want to see if an immune response it is protective -- that is to say, if you introduce this protein into a patient, do you activate adaptive lymphocytes? If so, do you even activate the right lymphocytes? For instance, if you activate antibody-producing B cells, but your pathogen is intracellular (that is, infects your cells and hides within them), antibodies might do squat all. As such, you need to ensure whatever your target is, that it is protective, and stimulates the right type of lymphocytes. We can somewhat dictate what lymphocytes are activated by using things called adjuvants, but that adds another layer of complexity to the equation that I won't get into. Let say protein X stimulates the right type of lymphocytes and results in a protective immune response. Great! Now what? Use an animal model. Is it still protective in mice, or is it toxic to them? These are but a few of the many barriers vaccine projects run up against -- you can often find a potential target, but they often end not being protective, are toxic in the animal models tested, have undesirable side effects, do not produce long-term immunity, etc. Oh, don't forget that depending on what you are trying to vaccinate against (be it bacteria, viral, etc.) will impact how your approach, what you can/cannot target, and how you can go about this whole process. At this point, its important to factor in economics.  Conservatively, vaccine development can cost hundreds of millions of US dollars to develop from inception through all phases of clinical trials.</p>
<p>While at times vaccine development can seem daunting, they are an extremely important component of modern public healthcare. Though vaccine development is a long arduous, frustrating road, there are a lot of success stories -- through them, we've managed to prevent a lot of disease and suffering as a consequence of infectious microorganisms. </p>
<p>Note: the above explanation is at times an over-generalization with respect to immunology and does not fully represent what we currently know is going on in terms of our understanding of immunology or how vaccines work. I've also neglected to include citations for all of the points I've made because that is way too time prohibitive for me right now (If I did, I might as well be writing a review article). As such, the information I'm discussing is drawn from my education and the classes I've taken thus far.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
