		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electrons have a fundamental property called the quantum mechanical spin. This spin can be understood and described as an intrinsic angular momentum.</p>
<p>The spin creates a magnetic dipole moment with a certain magnitude. In non-interacting electrons, these dipole moments are randomly oriented such that in average all magnetic moments cancel each other and the net magnetization is vanishing. If the electrons are brought inside an external magnetic field, the spins partially align such that a rather small net dipole moment is created which is aligned in the same direction as the external field. This is called paramagnetism. As soon as the external magnetic field is removed, the electrons lose their alignment and the overall magnetization is zero again.</p>
<p>If the distance between the electrons is reduced they start to interact with each other. Either through their direct magnetic interaction between the dipoles (dipole-dipole interaction) or through a quantum mechanical effect called exchange interaction. This causes the electrons to align with respect to their direct neighbor, either in a parallel or anti-parallel configuration. In the former case (ferromagnetism) the individual magnetic moments add up and a large net magnetization is maintained, even in the absence of an external magnetic field. In the anti-parallel case, it is called antiferromagnetism and the net magetization is cancelled even in the presence of an external magnetic field.</p>
<p>In ferromagnets, the spins do align only within certain volumes, called the magnetic domains. Between these domains, these large net magnetizations may again be randomly oriented such that the overall magnetization of a piece of ferromagnetic metal is zero. If such a material is brought inside a sufficiently strong magnetic field, the domains rearrange such that all their magnetizations add up. The domains' orientations may be effectively &quot;locked-in&quot; so that when the external field is removed, the material maintains a significant amount of net magnetization and a magnet is obtained. This is called persistence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

My version of the question is, why do electric fields/electric forces exist at all? Also, why are there two types of electric charges and not more or less?

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Each electron fundamentally has its own intrinsic dipole moment. Then the electrons and nuclei combine to form atoms, which have some total dipole moment.</p>
<p>Then many atoms assemble into a macroscopic piece of material. In a ferromagnetic material, neighboring magnetic dipoles interact strongly with each other so that an overall magnetization Can exist even if there is no external magnetic field.</p>
<p>The magnetic field that the object produces is just the sum of many small magnetic fields due to the dipole moments of the particles that make it up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have addressed the issue why electrons get their magnetic dipole moment, but let me try to rephrase it a bit. </p>
<p>The quantum mechanics (QM) has a few postulates (these things are like axioms, you cannot challenge them from within the theory, because the whole theory is built on top of them), and first postulate dictates that the entire information about the system is contained in something called a <em>wave vector</em> (which is, for practical purposes, the same as a <strong>wave function</strong>). And hence, knowing the wave vector at one point allows you to calculate the entire future and past of the system. That's the reason Schrodinger (and Dirac) equations are first order in time derivatives. Another postulate is that there exists a <strong>positive-definite</strong> probability density function which together with a probability current satisfies <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_equation#Quantum_mechanics" target="_blank">continuity equation</a>. Problem arises when trying to marry QM and Special Theory of Relativity (STR). To have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_covariance" target="_blank">Lorentz-covariant</a> 1st order quantum mechanical theory which satisfies these 2 postulates, it <strong>must</strong> describe particles with spin.</p>
<p>So basically spin 1/2 particles are a consequence of a fundamental symmetry of nature - the O(3,1) Lorentz group (fancy way of saying that the universe obeys the laws of special theory or relativity).</p>

<p>[2] <strong>How do electrons get their electric fields?</strong></p>
<p>This is a tough one - from what we know, it's just the way it simply is. As far as leptons are concerned, we discovered there's no need for a massive fermion to have charge (neutrino). What in Quantum Field Theory we say is that electronic field simply couples to photonic field (electromagnetic field) with coupling constant Î± (1/137).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
