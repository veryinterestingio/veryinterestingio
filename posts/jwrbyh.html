		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hard is not the same as tough is not the same as strong.</p>
<p>Cybertruck's stainless steel body panels are hard; they're probably also tough, although that's usually not very relevant for body panels. They're not any stronger than they need to be though (since that's what drives weight), so their crash behavior shouldn't be meaingingfully different.</p>
<p>Hard = how easy it is to scratch. This is obviously really relevant for vehicle body panels, we want them to stay looking nice, harder materials are harder to scratch and stay good looking for longer.</p>
<p>Tough = how easy it is for a crack to grow. Body panels don't usually crack so this isn't a big deal. It's a huge deal for fatigue-critical structure (stuff that goes through a lot of stress cycles) but that's also not usually a big deal for body panels, they're mostly decorative and not carrying nearly as much load as the chassis.</p>
<p>Strong = how much stress it can carry without yielding (permanent deformation). Cybertruck doesn't need to be 30x stronger...it might be 1 or 2x stronger because of the extra battery weight, but nowhere near 30x. That would just be wasted weight, which drives down range and drives up costs, so there's no reason to do that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is probably a difference between the stuff and design used as the energy absorbent crash structure versus the internal frame that has to hold the load of the vehicle. You can absolutely make crash absorbent structures even out of very &quot;hard&quot; material - it is more about the shape than the materials used. Nonetheless, it would seem intelligent to only use the very strong and expensive material for load bearing internal structures and not the &quot;outer&quot; part of the vehicle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Contrary to popular belief, modern cars are WAY safer than decades-old cars. Modern cars have stronger frames and stronger internal occupant protection cages, plus crumple zones that give way and safely absorb energy upon impact.  Older cars have heavier external sheet metal, but their occupant compartments are far more easily compromised in the event of a collision and they are far less effective at safely dissipating energy bc they lack crumple zones.</p>
<p>For anecdotal proof, ask an extrication specialist (think jaws of life) who regularly has to cut into the occupant compartments of crashed vehicles to remove injured or dead people.  Theyâ€™ll tell you that cutting into older cars is way easier bc the steel is softer.</p>
<p>For a crash test, see <a href="https://youtu.be/TikJC0x65X0" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/TikJC0x65X0</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The passenger compartment on today's cars is stronger than past cars. There is a ton of crash test data to support this. Body panels are weaker but their function is cosmetic and for aerodynamics, they don't contribute to much to crash resistance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those who say cars are &quot;Weaker&quot; are entirely incorrect. Classic cars will, very slightly, resist a sub 5-mph impact better as the bumpers are usually solid steel and bolted directly to the frame. Beyond that nearly every modern car will basically destroy a classic one in a head-on crash. As stated elsewhere, the Cybertruck's body has a high surface hardness, but it's not the major structure of the vehicle and will deform readily in a crash.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
