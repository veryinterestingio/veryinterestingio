		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s because of the way color was added to the original U.S. TV standard. (I’m assuming you are referring to the now-obsolete analog system; it obviously doesn’t work like this in the current digital systems.)</p>
<p>Color TV had to be made compatible with the original black-and-white system. </p>
<p>Color TV signals are a little bit different than black-and-white TV signals - a certain frequency band within the signal is used to transmit color information. That band corresponds to high frequency horizontal detail (patterns about 1/200th of the width of the screen). In a Color TV signal, those details are elided and the information used to carry hue and saturation information instead. </p>
<p>This meant that Color TVs had to be able to correctly display a black and white transmission, one in which no color information was present. The way this was achieved was the addition of a “color killer” circuit, which detected the signals that indicated a color TV transmission and forced the set to behave as a black-and-white receiver when those signals (specifically, the “color burst” signal, which is a brief burst of the color sub-carrier frequency transmitted during the horizontal blanking period) weren’t present.</p>
<p>Having a signal of the correct frequency at the correct time for that period of time is extremely unlikely to occur by chance (and even if it did, it would disappear again before you had the chance to notice it). So when the TV is showing static, it thinks it's showing an old black-and-white movie and turns off the color interpretation circuitry, leading to black-and-white static. </p>
<p>Of course, if you’re not tuned into ANY signal, those color signals aren’t present, so even”static” looks just like it would on a black-and-white set. Later, the dominant European system (PAL) would behave in a very similar manner.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main signal on a PAL or NTSC TV is the luminance, the brightness. This is what you see in static. The AGC is running maximum trying to pull out a signal which isn't there, so all you see is natural background radio noise. Some of it part of the cosmic microwave background, left over from the Big Bang.</p>
<p>Chrominance is a distinct part of the carrier which requires synchronising and decoding. Obviously in static this isn't present.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a kid, we had an old TV with a wheel to adjust the frequency of the desired station. The closer to the correct frequency you got, the better the picture was, but only on the exact frequency, there was color.</p>
<p>What I want to say is: The color is an added feature to a black/white signal protocol. If it doesn't come to a specific time in the signal, the TV won't interpret color to the signal. Static noise will highly unlikely replicate a color signal for longer than your eye (or the TV) can notice it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a follow up question because I feel like I read something interesting and now I can't remember what it was. It was something to do with how TV &quot;snow&quot; isn't as random as it appears. It always creates <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/%D0%9F%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA_%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B5.jpg/1920px-%D0%9F%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA_%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B5.jpg" target="_blank">this kind of pattern</a>. Where as if it was truely random you'd get more clumps of solid black and solid white. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Random_static.gif/250px-Random_static.gif" target="_blank">Like this</a>.</p>
<p>Can anyone remind me why this happens? I'm sure I remember reading there was some significance to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I once heard that the static observed and the noise made was proof of the Big Bang. That the “white noise” found from television set specifically the antenna(bunny ears) and the resulting image can be found at any point in space... no matter where they tested in space that noise and observed black and white pattern would occur. I appreciate the most voted response but I’m curious now if there is any truth behind what I was told awhile ago. Any one got an answer for this?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
