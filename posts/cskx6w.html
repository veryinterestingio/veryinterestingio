		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It varies depending on the type of nut, but generally speaking they go through a machine with a rotating drum inside a stationary drum: the gap between the drums is slightly smaller than the whole nut with its shell but bigger than the nutmeat inside.  This gently cracks the shell, and then the nutmeat and shell pieces fall out through the bottom.</p>
<p>Typically the shells are separated from the nutmeats using an air blast, which blows the light shells away and leaves the heavy nutmeats behind.</p>
<p>How do they do it without harming the nutmeat?  Well, they do harm a lot of them, but they use screens and air flow and manual inspection to sort them by size and weight, so the intact nuts get sold in the snack aisle, while the broken ones get sold as chopped nuts, butter, meal, or oil.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For sunflowers, there's a machine called a &quot;dehuller&quot; which looks like a giant disc brake rotor.  The machine is spun up to well over 1,000 RPM, and the seeds are dumped in the middle (at a carefully controlled rate).  The huge amount of centrifugal force from the machine throws the sunflower seed out the side and against a steel or ceramic ring around the rotor, smashing the hull apart.</p>
<p>It doesn't get the seed out perfectly, and a lot of them end up smashed into little pieces.  The smashed shells are also still mixed up and have to be separated.  This is done with a series of air-based machines, and the shells are sold as an alternative to coal for heating buildings.</p>
<p>The seeds are then sorted out by size using a machine called a Gravity Table (google it, it's too hard to explain here).  The tiniest pieces are called &quot;fines&quot; and are used to make the birdfood that comes glued to plastic sticks at pet food stores.  The ones that are just broken in half are called &quot;mediums,&quot; which also go to birdfood and/or oil, and the whole seeds are called &quot;Coarse chips,&quot; which are sold as food to go in multigrain bread/everything bagels, salad bars, or as birdfood.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Peanuts are shelled kinda like grating cheese.  There is a set of screens (like holes in cheese grate) in which the whole in-shell peanut is on with holes large enough for peanut meat to fall thru. Then on top is a set of bars that rub the peanuts one direction then other like grating cheese...  the shells slowly breaks up allowing meat inside to fall thru. Hulls are blown/vacuumed off and you are left with raw shelled peanuts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
