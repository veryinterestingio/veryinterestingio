		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. Short term memory really only refers to what you are paying attention to right at that moment. Right now, the words that you’re reading are in your short term memory. Pretty much everything else - the post you looked at before this one, what you ate for breakfast, the last text you got - that’s all already in your long term memory.</p>
<p>So you can think about STM as attention in a certain moment, and LTM as what we usually think of as memory. Attention is housed in a different area of the brain than memory is. So yes, when you move something from STM to LTM (a process called “encoding”) it’s moving from one area to another. </p>
<p>But if you’re thinking more about the difference between being able to remember what you ate for breakfast this morning vs what you ate for breakfast 3 Tuesdays ago, that’s all in the same place! And in fact, both of those things have been encoded to your LTM and the reason you can’t remember what you ate 3 Tuesdays ago isn’t because you didn’t <em>store</em> that information, it’s because you can’t <em>retrieve</em> that information. It’s all in the same place, it’s just a matter of being able to retrieve it. </p>
<p>Get this: our LTM is limitless. Everything is in there. That’s why sometimes you’ll be walking down the street and smell a certain food and suddenly you’re transported back to a meal you had 15 years ago. It’s in there, it’s just a matter of being able to access it. </p>
<p>(This is, of course, in brains that are normally functioning and don’t have damage to parts that store memory.)</p>
<p>(If you want the specifics, memory is largely <del>stored in</del> encoded by the hippocampus, which is pretty close to the middle of your brain.)</p>
<p>EDIT: Clearly the limitless claim is not cut and dry, as evidenced from many good arguments in the comments (ignore the mean ones, for your own good!). Our memory is certainly limitless in that we don’t have a limit on being able to make new memories - it’s not like we can only hold a certain amount and once it’s full we can no longer remember new things. But the claim I made that everything is stored for forever is harder to <em>prove</em>. To be fair, it’s also hard to <em>disprove</em> because it’s hard to delineate  between storage and retrieval on memory tests. </p>
<p>For those who question my distinction between STM and LTM, read <a href="https://open.lib.umn.edu/intropsyc/chapter/8-1-memories-as-types-and-stages/" target="_blank">here</a> for more. My description is accurate. Also the distinction between working memory and short term memory is largely <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3425965/" target="_blank">conceptual</a>, and not as clear cut as many comments claim.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>BTW the evidence does not support the pop psychology/Freudian idea that everything you perceive is transferred from short term memory into long term memory. I mention this only because the current best answer attests this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain is a neural net which stores things very differently then say a library. It's not like taking a library book from the new stack of books and filing it in the correct spot in the library's shelves. Instead the book is first broken down into it's component parts like characters, story line, settings, events, notable quotes and descriptive passages. These components are all linked to each other and scene by scene in the book is linked to the next scene. However also linked to those memories will be how you were feeling, what you were smelling, what you were hearing and what you were thinking about at the time. These individual components also get cross referenced which other long-term memories such as similar stories or movies or characters.</p>
<p>Let say that your were reading Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. And while you were reading part of it there was a raging storm outside and you were annoyed because you'd have to go tidy the yard tomorrow. All that sense memory gets cross referenced with your new memories of the book. So in future when there's a bad storm you might well trigger to think about Mr Weasel's flying Anglia. Now you've seen the movies already and read the first book so you've already got some memories of Harry, Hermione and Ron and you've got a visual reference for them as well, but yet you also have a different visual reference being the artwork of the books' cover, but the movies actors are much more strongly referenced so they spring into your mind whenever you're visualizing the story not the cover art of the book. You get to the Basilisk at the end but as you're reading you're thinking and visualizing Smaug from the Hobbit films. So even though a basilisk and a dragon are two separate things your mind may still link them together. Bizarrely you might land up dreaming about roller skates that night because you've linked the memory of Ron being very afraid of Hagrid's former pet Arogog with the memory of Ron in the following film casting Riddikulus on the Bogart. A month after reading the book you might want to try recall the story in full, but you struggle. You can vividly remember particular scenes and things that were said and character descriptions but remembering the book scene by scene may be very difficult. You'd fall back to recounting the film scene by scene as best you can because that's a more intense memory for you. And yet you may be able to recall about Nearly Headless Nick's Deathday Party because that stood out for you at the time by not being in the film, but you'd have no idea where exactly it fits in the story.</p>
<p>Memory is extremely messy and highly interconnected. Parrot-style-learning layers things into our memory in a very weakly connected way. Memories are only strengthened as you use them and interconnect them multiple ways. We do understand bits and pieces of how the mind stores memories but we're yet to understand the full process but it's not as simple as grabbing the next book from the pile and shelving it in the right place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's not how it works, OP.  Things don't move from short-term to long-term; they're completely separate processes.</p>
<p>I used to work in a mental health center, one resident had severe brain damage that completely destroyed his short-term memory.  Other than that, he was mostly fine.  Notably, his long-term memory was <em>excellent</em>.  (he was pursuing a PhD at Oxford, on a Rhodes scholarship, when he had the accident).  He couldn't tell you what he had for breakfast today; but he could tell you what he had for breakfast 3 weeks ago.</p>
<p>You could tell him the same joke, over and over, and he'd laugh, each time, as if hearing it the first time.  BUT... a few days later, he'd be quite angry with you.  AND, it'd take a few days for your apology &amp; more respectful behavior to result in forgiveness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
