<p>This might get into game theory or statistics, but how could they be sure that the Germans would not 'get wise' and switch their code? How often could they change their behavior before it became suspicious?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is more a history of science question, but there were a few big factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The British were extremely successful at keeping the operation a secret, even within their own government. Only the highest commanders were cleared to know the source of the intelligence they received, and they kept it a closely guarded secret, even from their allies and their own officers. They were also extremely successful at both intelligence and counter-intelligence operations, and there was effectively no Axis spy network in Britian. Prominent members of the codebreaking operation were unable and unwilling to divulge their association with the codebreaking group for decades after the war ended, sometimes at great personal expense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wherever possible, conventional intelligence gathering was used to provide a plausible alternative explanation. For example, Enigma might reveal the presence of an Axis naval convoy, and then Allied reconnaissance planes were sent to independently find and report the convoy on their own. Once these searchers were observed by Axis forces, they provided a cover for the true source of the information. In addition, to go along with the point above, care was taken to prevent Allied forces from guessing that something was up. Multiple search teams would be sent out so it wouldn't appear as though they were getting luckier than they should have been. In another example the British concocted a fictitious spy and fictitious reports from that spy, who was then exposed to the Axis forces via radio traffic so as to provide a plausible explanation for enigma intelligence. </p>
</li>
<li>The Axis cryptanalyists knew that attacks against Enigma were possible in theory, but thought these attacks were too laborious to achieve in practice. They additionally conducted their own reviews of the Enigma system and found it to be secure. They even decrypted Allied communications and did not find any reason to suspect their device had been broken, because operational security was very tight. In light of that, they looked for alternative explanations of Allied successes and found scapegoats in technology like radar (of course, radar advancements themselves were also significant during the war, so they weren't off the mark so much as measuring effect strength poorly).</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If memory serves, there was no statistical formula. They decided as a loose rule, that any action they took, based on information gained from the team at Bletchley Park (where they broke the enigma code), had to be based on information they would've been able to learn from another source. It was really up to the higher ups, such as Churchill, to decide when and where to use the information they got. As long as their actions wouldn't give away the fact that they'd broken the code they would proceed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The secrecy wasn't just kept by the British, but also by the Polish. </p>
<p>Alan Turing was always up front with this, that Polish mathematicians cracked the code shortly before the war broke out, and relayed that information to British Intelligence. </p>

<p>I've had the pleasure and honor to be allowed to not only see, but to touch and play with a genuine Enigma machine from WW2. Amazing machine, and gave me a new appreciation for the amazing work the Polish mathematicians and Alan Turing and his staff did to crack this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It wasn't so much as statistics that kept it secret it. They did it more by not letting people know they had done it. Even very very high military personnel didn't know. Picking and choosing when to use the knowledge so that it wouldn't be obvious that they had broken the code. If they had to act on specific knowledge from it then they would create cover stories along with them to cover it up. The British had been able to flip every single German spy which helped. The Germans never took any thought of breaking enigma was possible seriously so they always trusted it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
