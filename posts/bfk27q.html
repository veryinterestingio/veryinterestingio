		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, typically a single bacterium will not be able to cause any infection.  The number that is needed is highly variable depending on the type of bacteria and probably on the strength of your immune system though.  Of course, it's not like there's an exact &quot;cutoff&quot; at which point a certain number of bacteria are guaranteed to infect you, it's a function of probability.  The Wikipedia article for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_infective_dose" target="_blank">minimal infective dose</a> actually does a pretty good job of explaining it, and showing how much it can vary (e.g., compare number of bacteria needed for 1% chance of infection between enterohemorrhagic <em>E. coli</em> vs. <em>Listeria</em>, which is over a billion times higher).  And if you want to read into it more, here's <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2042013/" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3280976/" target="_blank">papers</a> that discuss the relationship between virulence and infective dose for different pathogens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is definitely a certain number needed, but it varies wildly from germ to germ. On a purely statistical level, odds of infection go up with more germs just like your odds of getting shot go up with more flying bullets, but specific germs have different tactics that can change the odds. For example, if you ate a salad, most of the germs on it would die in your stomach acid, but some of them may be able to resist your stomach acid long enough to get into your intestines where they can make you sick. </p>
<p>Other tactics can depend on their numbers. Germs can communicate with each other and will change how they act based on how many of their friends are around. This is called quorum sensing and the basic idea is that they won't do certain things if they don't have any buddies around to back them up. So its possible to have some nasty bugs inside you, but they might not have the numbers to do any damage. </p>
<p>Other things to consider include where the bacteria are (in your gut vs in your bloodstream) and how healthy the person is (normal and healthy vs on their deathbed). So basically, while you might be able to drink a whole glass of some germs and be fine, others can get you sick even if only 100 cells got inside you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, it depends.  You immune system will hunt down and destroy individual germs before they make you sick, but if a single manages to multiply fast enough, that will make your sick.</p>
<p>The key is that you need enough in your body to start doing damage.  Whether that many enter or body, or multiple to that level later, it still makes you sick. The exact number also varies from germ to germ, and the type matters too.</p>
<p>In other words, it's complicated and there is no simple answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone has already said, most infection causing bacteria are already on or in us. I use the car thief analogy to explain opportunistic pathogens to students,
The thief is casing lots of parked cars, the first is locked and has a high end alarm system so no way in, the next has a window open, the thief gets in but leaves when the alarm goes off, and then finds an unlocked car with an outdated security system that they can disable,
It also helps to understand the difference between colonisation and infection, just because the bacteria are there, they're not necessarily causing harm and many are beneficial, but breaks in skin integrity or invasive devices (in a medical scenario!) allow organisms to get to places where they can take advantage and cause infection</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
