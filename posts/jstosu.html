<p><strong>Could a hippo survive a shipwreck in the middle of an ocean?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fun fact: hippos <em>can't swim</em>.</p>
<p>Whaaa- ?</p>
<p>Well, at least, not very well. Like, at all. They're poorly streamlined, have little to no limb modification for swimming, and their bones are far too dense (on purpose) to permit buoyancy. Instead, hippos essentially treat bodies of water like 'terrestrial zones with microgravity', and walk or gallop along the bottoms of lakes, rivers and the like (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYQ0m6DV1uY" target="_blank">video here</a>), reaching the surface in order to breathe by jumping or standing somewhere shallow enough for their heads to poke through the surface. Further, they can only hold their breaths for about ~5 minutes.</p>
<p>A hippo dropped into the open ocean would flail about, sink like a stone and drown. RIP. </p>
<p>They'd be fine on the moon though.*</p>

<p><strong>Bonus Hippos:</strong> But wait, how did hippopotamuses arrive on Madagascar if they couldn't swim?</p>
<p>Good question, I ask myself! Until very recently, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malagasy_hippopotamus" target="_blank">several species of dwarf hippo</a> could be found on Madagascar, an island currently separated from continental Africa by ~260 miles of open ocean. Dwarf hippos were once similarly found on the Mediterranean islands of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippopotamus_creutzburgi" target="_blank">Crete</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_dwarf_hippopotamus" target="_blank">Cyprus</a>, and others. If they can't swim, how did they get there?</p>
<p>Nobody really knows. Some authors have suggested the previous existence of land bridges or island chains which would have shortened crossing distances considerably. It's certainly the case oceanic sea levels were lower (by up to ~130m) during the early Holocene, cutting the distance between shores and possibly presenting several currently submerged peaks as islands along the way (i.e. the David Ridge on the edge of the Madagascan tectonic plate). Nonetheless, deep, broad troughs still remained separating any islands, posing a formidable barrier for terrestrial animals.</p>
<p>As far as Madagascar is concerned, a more likely explanation is given by the fact extinct Malagasy hippos were morphologically similar to the contemporary, and more terrestrial, pygmy hippopotamus, rather than the larger, more aquatic, common hippopotamuses. They were more cursorial (adapted to 'run'), with fossil evidence placing them equally at home in forested highlands as swampy lowlands - perhaps not dissimilar to modern (likewise semi-aquatic) tapirs which, you guessed it, are positively buoyant and can swim. Consequently, given the (almost) unique negative buoyancy in modern hippos is a selected adaptation to their current aquatic lives, and palaeontological evidence suggests the extinct hippos were considerably less aquatic, rather unintuitively it's therefore the hippo lineages less well adapted to aquatic life (e.g. being buoyant, the default in mammals) that were the ones that conquered the sea and made it.</p>
<p>Add to this the fact that oceanic salinity was higher during the early Holocene (n.b. it's not sufficient enough today to keep a hippo afloat, no), particularly in the Mediterranean, and it's not too hard to imagine swimming hippos that could casually hop to an island or three. </p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Modern hippopotamus cannot swim, no, but it's not inconceivable extinct lines of 'forest hippos' with less dense bones could, and it's they who explored new island frontiers. If Pi had Jurassic Park-ed one of those instead, maybe it'd be okay?</p>
