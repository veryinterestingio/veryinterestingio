		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spanish Flu was signficantly more deadly than any other known influenza. Where a &quot;normal&quot; flu rarely has a mortality &gt;0.1% , that of Spanish Flu is estimated to have been &gt; 2.5% - so significantly higher than Covid-19.</p>
<p>It also had a strange mortality curve. Nearly all influenza show a &quot;U curve&quot; when plotted against age. So high deaths among under 5s lowering as age increases - flattening out, then rising sharply with after 65.  Spanish flu showed a &quot;W&quot; curve - similar to a U curve , but with a &quot;hump&quot; peaking at 35. (one of the panics about early reports of 2009 Swine Flu was the number of younger people it killed)</p>
<p>With modern treatment, undoubtedly the Spansh Flu deaths would have been lower - one of the main causes of death was probably secondary bacterial infection as there were no antibiotics. That said, subsequent mutations were significantly less deadly, so something in the virus itself must have been responsible.</p>
<p>An educated guess would be that a modern Spanish flu would still be deadlier than Covid, and would likely still kill millions despite improved medical care.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's definitely difficult to say.</p>
<p>As you noted, artificial respiration wouldn't be figured out until 10 years later, but that's not all the trouble. Nutritional sciences were only finally starting to take hold, there was less access to clean water, and PPE was still pretty basic. Then there's the obvious difference of population density and urbanization.</p>
<p>And that's before we factor in WWI, which was the biggest part of the problem: refugee communities, rationing of food and medicine, and the constant cycling of thousands of soldiers to and from the front on a regular basis on top of wounded people having to also fight the disease, not to mention the intentional bar on posting accurate numbers of infections. There was just a lot of things going on that made the Spanish flu, which is now called H1N1, pretty much a perfect storm.</p>
<p>Edit: a pair of typos</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctor with my first publication being on H1N1 Spanish Flu, as well as my most recent publication on COVID-19. Granted, my background is in trauma surgery and critical care but my parents are both senior doctors in infectious diseases and virology, so I suppose they taught me a thing or two over the years.</p>
<p>Short answer - yes Spanish Flu today would be deadlier.</p>
<p>For the people saying that technology has improved significantly, yes it certainly has but by and large, treatment even today is primarily supportive. Sticking someone on high flow oxygen or a ventilator and waiting until they recover by themselves. </p>
<p>As for ventilators, and as a last chance saloon - ECMO - there are absolutely nowhere near enough to go round. To put it into perspective, the UK has six centres nationally that can provide ECMO. Technology can be as advanced as you like it to be, but when there are millions of people in respiratory failure all at once and only a comparative <em>handful</em> of very complex machines which people commit to for periods lasting weeks, they aren’t much use.</p>
<p>To make matters worse - Spanish Flu killed young adults in their prime. People would go to sleep breathless and in the morning family would wake up to find them cold, blue and dead.</p>
<p>EDIT: There are quite a few posts on here I would disagree with to varying degrees. Happy to allude to the difference between pandemic flu and seasonal flu, if anyone’s interested.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spanish Flu was more deadly depending on the population it affected. Overall Case Fatality was estimated around 2.5% overall based on some estimates, but others I've seen place the CFR as high as 30% in young adult men. </p>
<p>Coronavirus seems most deadly in older people and those with weakened immune systems or major comorbidities. Estimates place the CFR in a similar range between 1.5% and 3% but the number for young healthy people is probably below 0.1% whereas the mortality can be as high as 30% in the most vulnerable.</p>
<p>Spanish Flu killed young, healthy people through triggering a hyperactive immune response and probably would not have been significantly helped by a ventilator</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two things to remember about Covid:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The real danger of Covid is the potential for overwhelming hospitals if everyone gets sick at the same time. The Covid mortality rate is low, but other diseases still exist and other injuries can still happen. If the hospitals are filled beyond capacity there’d be no bandwidth to treat non-Covid patients.</p>
</li>
<li>Asymptomatic infections are very common (roughly 40% of cases). When you have the flu you know you have the flu, and so does everyone around you. With Covid you can walk around infecting everyone else and you’d never know anything was amiss. </li>
</ol>
<p>The 1918 influenza virus was more deadly, but SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible and more unpredictable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
