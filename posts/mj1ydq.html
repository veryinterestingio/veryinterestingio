		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lets say I want to make almond flavored cookies. I can grind up a bunch of almonds for that, but to get the flavor I'm looking for, my cookie will be pretty much just crushed almonds. </p>
<p>What I want is just the chemical responsible for the almond flavor. Then I can add a tiny drop of it and have my cookies taste as strong as I want. I want an extract!</p>
<p>But almond extract is principally just one chemical - benzaldehyde - and benzaldehyde isn't unique to almonds. Lots of plants make it in varying amounts. So why extract it from expensive almonds when you could extract it from apricot pits, which are essentially free?</p>
<p>I can use benzaldehyde and a few more chemicals and make a cherry flavor (ever notice almond extract kinda smells like fake cherry flavor?)  Theres a ton of overlap in nature. The chemical responsible for the smell of a not-quite-ripe melon is the same as the smell of freshly cut grass (cis-3-hexanol, best described as &quot;green smell&quot;). Vanillin goes into everything, and acetaldehyde is in practically every fruit.</p>
<p>A flavor house will source a few thousand of these chemicals, along with various exracts, oils, fractions, and oleoresins, and a flavorist will mix them together to make it taste like whatever. </p>
<p>They're listed as natural flavor because 1. The mix is a trade secret. 2. Complex flavors have like 60 ingredients and ingredient decs would be a mile long 3. The substances used have been individually vetted as safe by either the FDA or the FEMA GRAS panel.</p>
<p>So what do flavors look like?</p>
<p>A natural vanilla flavor with other natural flavors  would be something like:</p>
<p>A little vanilla extract</p>
<p>Vanillin</p>
<p>St. John's bread extract</p>
<p>Propenyl guaethol</p>
<p>Fenugreek extract</p>
<p>Maltol</p>
<p>You can keep adding to make it more convincing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ol>
<li>It's expensive</li>
<li>Vanilla derived from other natural vegetable resources is cheap</li>
<li>Almost all natural flavors sold by large flavor companies are vegetarian, kosher and halal to make them easy to use worldwide.</li>
<li>If they did use it, there would be a public relations disaster.</li>

<p>The article is short and it's worth reading the whole thing, but the most important snippets:</p>
<p>&quot;...a fruit, vegetable, meat, fish, dairy product, herb, spice, leaf, root, bark or bud that is then processed, fermented or distilled in some way &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because the FDA hasn't defined the term, companies can use it to refer to pretty much anything derived from a plant or animal.  And natural flavors can also include a variety of chemical additives, such as preservatives. The FDA doesn’t require companies to disclose what additional chemicals a particular item contains&quot;</p>
<p>They aren't listed as individual ingredients because if they listed &quot;anal excretion of beaver&quot; you probably wouldn't buy it</p>
<p>(<a href="https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/lifestyle/food-and-drink/where-does-vanilla-flavouring-come-beaver-castoreum-explained-and-why-we-use-it-cakes-and-icing-3030071" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/lifestyle/food-and-drink/where-does-vanilla-flavouring-come-beaver-castoreum-explained-and-why-we-use-it-cakes-and-icing-3030071" target="_blank">https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/lifestyle/food-and-drink/where-does-vanilla-flavouring-come-beaver-castoreum-explained-and-why-we-use-it-cakes-and-icing-3030071</a></a>)</p>
<p>Spices are listed separately because the FDA has a separate category for them.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?fr=101.22" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?fr=101.22" target="_blank">https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?fr=101.22</a></a></p>
<p>(a)(1) The term <em>artificial flavor</em> or <em>artificial flavoring</em> means any substance, the function of which is to impart flavor, which is not derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, fish, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof. Artificial flavor includes the substances listed in §§ 172.515(b) and 182.60 of this chapter except where these are derived from natural sources.</p>
<p>(2) The term <em>spice</em> means any aromatic vegetable substance in the whole, broken, or ground form, except for those substances which have been traditionally regarded as foods, such as onions, garlic and celery; whose significant function in food is seasoning rather than nutritional; that is true to name; and from which no portion of any volatile oil or other flavoring principle has been removed. Spices include the spices listed in § 182.10 and part 184 of this chapter, such as the following:</p>
<p>Allspice, Anise, Basil, Bay leaves, Caraway seed, Cardamon, Celery seed, Chervil, Cinnamon, Cloves, Coriander, Cumin seed, Dill seed, Fennel seed, Fenugreek, Ginger, Horseradish, Mace, Marjoram, Mustard flour, Nutmeg, Oregano, Paprika, Parsley, Pepper, black; Pepper, white; Pepper, red; Rosemary, Saffron, Sage, Savory, Star aniseed, Tarragon, Thyme, Turmeric.</p>
<p>Paprika, turmeric, and saffron or other spices which are also colors, shall be declared as &quot;spice and coloring&quot; unless declared by their common or usual name.</p>
<p>(3) The term <em>natural flavor</em> or <em>natural flavoring</em> means the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional. Natural flavors include the natural essence or extractives obtained from plants listed in §§ 182.10, 182.20, 182.40, and 182.50 and part 184 of this chapter, and the substances listed in § 172.510 of this chapter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
