		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You go to kindergarten for a few years, usually when your kid is between 3 and 6 years.
This is not in the educational system, however. This is somewhat socializing with others, learning to follow basic rules, get a routine and stuff like this. </p>
<p>After that, you go to the elementary school (Grundschule), which basically teaches you the basics of ... well, everything. Simple math, spelling, pronounciation, ... you get the idea. </p>
<p>In my case, the first half (2 years) were not graded. When we wrote a test or something like this, it was simply marked as &quot;read&quot; or &quot;done&quot;.
Starting in the 3rd year, we go our marks. Depending on your grades, the teacher then recommends you to a school. You don't have to follow that advice, but it is.. recommended. </p>
<p>Usually, you get to chose between 3 schools: </p>
<ul>
<li>Hauptschule</li>
<li>Realschule</li>
<li>Gymnasium (for english-readers: this has nothing to do with working out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the school, the stuff teached is different and the amount it takes to finish that school differs: </p>
<ul>
<li>Hauptschule takes you 5 additional years to complete (class 5 - 9) --&gt; Berufsreife</li>
<li>Realschule 6 additional years (5 - 10) --&gt; Mittlere Reife</li>
<li>Gymnasium basically 9 additional years (5 - 13) --&gt; Abitur</li>
</ul>
<p>You might argue, that each school has a different pace and difficulty to it, when it comes down to effort. Ending one of this schools, awards you with a &quot;title&quot; which is important for your further applications, since you are partially selected on these. </p>
<p>If you finish a &quot;lower&quot; school successfuly, you can still &quot;upgrade&quot; your highest, educational level.
Also, you need an Abitur to study in an university. </p>
<p>To add a bit more to this: You are only allowed to study at a university, if you have your &quot;Abitur&quot;, which is basically the highest, educational level you can achieve (from the basic schools).
If you finished with your &quot;Mittlere Reife&quot;, you can still study in a so-called &quot;Fachhochschule&quot; (probably best translated to college of higher education or something like this). </p>
<p>If you study further in the university, (a few years / semesters) you get your &quot;Bachelor&quot;-status. This for example could be &quot;Bachelor of science&quot;. The amount of semesters is depending on what you are trying to achieve. After successfully obtaining this title, you are capable of going even further to get your &quot;master&quot; (master of sience&quot;) and <strong>after that</strong> you can make your &quot;Doctor&quot; (PhD). Usually, the intention for making this, is to teach at universities. You get another title as well (Professor). </p>
<p>One more thing, which I don't know is common in other countries:
You have a <strong>Schulpflicht</strong>. It is mandatory that you visit school for &quot;at least&quot; 9 years (hence the Hauptschule takes 5 additional years). After that, you aren't &quot;forced&quot; to go further. Everything after that is on a voluntary base.</p>
<p>It is hard to explain everything, specially in ELI5-Mode. Basic rule is: if you want to get a better degree, you always have to chance to. It doesn't matter how old you are or what you finished with. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
As /u/s0nderv0gel stated: There <em>are</em> some states, where the duration of school differs. There is no direct &quot;law&quot; for this. States have a mediocre level of impact on how they want to have their educational system built (up to adjusting the things you learn). This is kinda important as well, since <em>some</em> of the companies value your success depending on the state you are living in, since the difficulty is so variable. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I want to add another thing to DasDaffles's comment: The German educational system is not based on getting kids to college for higher education, there are basically two paths, one academic path and one based on trades. If you want to learn a trade you usually leave school after year 10 at age \~16 and start to work as an apprentice for about 3 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok. I'm not gonna go over the while thing again. u/DasSaffe did a pretty good job but they could have included a bit more detail on what you can do with the &quot;Mittlere Reife&quot;.</p>
<p>The &quot;Mittlere Reife&quot; is probably the most common degree (if you wanna call it a degree) and it's the requirement for most apprenticeships.If you don't want to pursue an apprenticeship however, you can go to the &quot;Berufliches Gymnasium&quot; or to the &quot;Fachoberschule&quot;. Both of these school forms are typically found in vocational school centres.</p>
<p>The &quot;Fachoberschule&quot; takes an additional 2 years (12 years in total) and awards the so called &quot;Fachoberschulreife&quot; or &quot;Fachabitur&quot;. It enables you to go to a University of applied scienes/vocational university and you may only enroll in courses of study that are related to your kind of Fachabitur (e.g. Economics).What's special about the Fachoberschule is the fact that you have a partner company. In the first year you will alternate between going to school and working as an intern. Many companies will hire their interns as apprentices once they receive their Fachabitur.</p>
<p>The &quot;Berufliches Gymnasium&quot; takes 3 (13 years in total) years and awards the &quot;Hochschulreife&quot; or &quot;Abitur&quot;, which is the same degree as the regular Gymnasium and it enables you to go to any University you want (as long as they also want you).  In the regular Gymnasium you can choose 2 major courses with (i think) basically no restrictions (as long as there are enough other students to form these courses). In the berufliches Gymnasium you get to choose one vocational major course (e.g. mechanical engineering, computer science) which starts in the first year. In the second year you get to choose your second major course, but you only get to choose between English, mathematics and german.</p>
<p>Many germans don't exactly know the differrence between these two.</p>
<p>With your &quot;Mittlere Reife&quot; you can also just start an apprenticeship. Most apprenticeships in Germany use the dual system. You apply for apprenticeships like you would for a regular job. You then work for that company but you also go to school. I believe it's something along the lines of a 2:1 ratio (work:school). The best thing: you usually get paid. It's not a lot in most cases, but it's definitely better than having to pay. Most appranticeships take 3 years to complete but you can also finish earlier if you can manage to pass the exam. Apprenticeships award the &quot;Facharbeiter&quot;.</p>
<p>Some schools also offer the &quot;Berufsausbildung mit Abitur&quot; (Apprenticeship with Abitur) which takes 4 years and awards a Facharbeiter and an Abitur. Not a lot of companies are too keen on this one though, because they don't want to invest into a dude for 4 years who then just goes to university. It's not really a smart investment.</p>
<p>When you have your Facharbeiter and at least 2 years of experience you can go to the &quot;Fachschule&quot; receive a higher degree of vocational education for example: Meister, Techniker.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: Whene you have a certain degree of vocational education and a few years of experience, you can also go to university and get a Masters Degree.</p>

<p>I really hope I didn't miss anything. If you find any errors in my little text, keep 'em, I have more than I could ever need.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer your second question if it is unique, it is not - we have almost identical system in Czech Republic and I assume a lot of countries around this part of the world have similar systems as well. The differences obviously depend on what you are comparing to, so you would need to be more specific in order to give more complete answer which systems are similar in that regard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You will have to explain what you found to be different and unique
in those articles before this part of your question can be answered.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
