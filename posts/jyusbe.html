<blockquote>
<p>Brosh said that this does not mean the vaccine changes peopleâ€™s genetic code. Rather, he said it is more like a USB device (the mRNA) that is inserted into a computer (your body). It does not impact the hard drive of the computer but runs a certain program.  </p>

<p>Why we can not have RNA vaccines to regenerate for example burned skin, or even heal heart related problems?</p></div></div>

In the case of an mRNA vaccine, the protein your cells are being told to make is an inactive part of the COVID virus, that teaches your body to recognize it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>mRNA instructs cells to produce a protein, and rebuilding injured tissues is much more complicated.  If you think of a cell as a factory, mRNA is an order to produce a simple raw material, like bricks.  No matter how many bricks the factory makes, they can't spontaneously assemble themselves to make a bunch of new factories.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are fine answers here about mRNA, but they haven't touched the issue of delivery yet. Even if you had a magic mRNA molecules that could regenerate heart, you need to direct the mRNA to only heart cells. You don't want heart cells growing elsewhere in your body. Only targeting a specific cell type is almost impossible to do, so instead we use viruses that will infect all the cells around the injection point. The virus (typically AAV) will actually insert it's DNA into your genome unlike the mRNA molecule. The trick here is that the inserted gene, let's say your heart regeneration gene, is put under the control of a promoter that is heart cell specific. Thus, you now have your heart regeneration gene expressed only in heart cells, and any of the off target cells can't express the gene. There are of course drawbacks to this method. The hottest approved method of this right now is Luxterna injection into the eye to replace non-functional RPE65 genes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The only connection between the mRNA technology and regenerative medicine I can think of is cellular reprogramming (also partial cellular reprogramming).</p>
<p>Here's a simplified overview of cellular reprogramming as a means to regeneration. mRNA molecules inserted into cells initiate protein synthesis. The 4 major proteins in cellular reprogramming are Oct-4, Klf-4, Sox-2 and c-Myc. These proteins create other cascades of action that completely transform the cell. </p>
<p>Think of it as reinstalling the operating system of the cell to factory settings. Age-associated cellular problems are eliminated and regeneration on both cellular and tissue level takes place. In this case, yes, mRNA technology could revolutionise medicine. But there are enormous obstacles to overcome.</p>
<p>At a certain point, the cells reach the so-called point of no return, at which point their operating system is completely reinstalled and they become embryonic cells. In essence, you send them back in time to when you were a foetus. This causes chaos and cancer. </p>
<p>Current research experiments with so-called partial cellular reprogramming, which attempts to stop the &quot;reinstalling&quot; before the point of no return is crossed, alrhough it's not sure yet whether the benefits of this reprogramming would still be present in partial reprogramming.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They tried to use synthetic mRNA (like that used in the vaccine) for other purposes but the high doses were producing a toxic immune response (to the mRNA).  They switched to vaccine therapy because they can give it at a lower dose that wasn't toxic.  If you regenerate tissue you would need a massive amount mRNA to generate a significant amount of tissue.  A vaccine is ideal because you only need to produce tiny bits of a virus and therefore need a much lower dose mRNA.  </p>
