		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the early days of the internet there was a lot going on. When what we now call &quot;the web&quot; (meaning websites) was being spun up it was supposed to be more organized and you could tell by what suffix it had.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>.org - was for orgs and non-profits</p>
<p>.edu - education</p>
<p>.com - commercial sites</p>
<p>.net - networks/internet infrastructure companies and sites.</p>
<p>and so on</p>
<p>However, pretty much the one that caught on during the &quot;.com&quot; boom of the 90s was... well, .com.  So .com instead just because the universal standard and no longer had any deeper meaning.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>A website its entire address, just like your home address (in the Us) needs a house number, street, city, state, and zip code</p>
<p>Take this: 3600 Las Vegas Blvd.
Las Vegas, NV 89109</p>
<p>Now what if we changed just the state:
3600 Las Vegas Blvd.
Las Vegas, <strong>FL</strong> 89109</p>
<p>Now thats an entirely different place right? Maybe it doesn't even exist.</p>
<p>A website that is www.reddit.com and one that is www.reddit.edu are to wholly different sites. The whole address matters</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer your second question:</p>
<p>A complete lookup of a domain name actually runs backwards, starting at the end.</p>
<p>So say you're looking up foo.random.com and you're wanting to do a full lookup rather than trusting your immediate DNS server.</p>
<p>First off, you would start by consulting a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_name_server" target="_blank">root name server</a> and asking it who controls .com.</p>
<p>That server will then answer and direct you to a server run by Verisign, who own the .com domain.  If you were instead looking up random.org, it would send you to Afilias, who runs .org.  Or if you looked up random.xxx, it would send you to Uniregistry.  Or if you asked for random.app, it would send you to Google.</p>
<p>You'd then ask Verisign's server &quot;Who is the nameserver for random.com?&quot; and it will tell you the answer.  This will typically point towards a server owned by a domain registrar, like Namecheap or GoDaddy, though large sites will often operate their own.</p>
<p>Then you ask that server &quot;What is the IP address for foo.random.com?&quot; and it gives you an answer.</p>
<p>Lookup complete, you now know who to connect to to get the site (or other service) that you were wanting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The suffixes also matter for reputation even if indeed technically it doesn't matter whether a domain is website.com, website.info, website.biz</p>
<p>.com has a better &quot;reputation&quot; for SEO purposes, it is seen as more trustworthy by search engines like Google etc....so that .com domains usually rank better in the search engines.  (There are many more factors, like domain age, how often it changed owners, this and that, but you get the idea).</p>
<p>So if someone wants to make a new website, it is simply better and looks more professional to use .COM rather than have a site like politics-news.info  or something which looks already spammy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Top Level Domains (TLD) are like private clubs, some with very strict rules on who can be a member - .gov, .mil - and some pretty chill about who can join - .com, .net. The Domain Naming Servers (DNS) don’t care what the TLD is as long as they know how to get the mapping to the IP address.</p>
<p>As a website builder it is your choice which club you want to be member of, buy the ‘membership’ from the club owners (domain registrars or resellers), and then update the DNS config to point to your website.</p>
<p>.com historically represented ‘commercial’ but now is available more generally to everyone.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;commercial&quot;.  People got the phrase &quot;dotcom&quot; in their heads in the early days of the Internet.  It doesn't matter what you use, but some of them are supposed to have different restrictions (org is supposed to be non-profit organisations, etc.).  It's just a free-for-all mess nowadays as they just charge more for the most popular ones.  Some countries top-level-domains are more strictly regulated, but not always.</p>
<p>Although, in every non-US country, lots of people will consider .com to be inappropriate unless you're a large multi-national corporation (technically the US companies should be using .co.us but they never do).  If you're french, you're gonna prioritise .fr sites for French companies over .com - it just looks tacky and amateur to just register the .com blindly.</p>
<p>I have had this argument at several prestigious companies who &quot;had to&quot; have the .com and every extension they could get their hands on (.eu and so on).  Eventually they all realise that you only need one, it makes no difference what it is, and having one controlled by your own country's legislation works out far better (e.g. all the uk companies just got booted off .eu, .com's can be shut down by the US registry whereas .co.uk has to go through Nominet, and so on).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
