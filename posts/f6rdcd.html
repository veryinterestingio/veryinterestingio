		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best argument I’ve heard (which did not totally convince me, but has certainly influenced how I write) is “If you need more commas for the sentence to make sense, then re-write your sentence. You are better off focusing on reducing ambiguity in your writing.”</p>
<p>Edit to add: Yes, I am aware that my use of parentheses is inelegant.</p>
<p>Edit to add 2: I can think of a real world example of the Oxford comma introducing ambiguity and having severe repercussions. I once saw a lawsuit where the parties fought over whether the winner was entitled to attorneys fees under the contract. Certain conditions had to be met in order for this to happen, but there was also a list of exceptions. Due to an awkward use of the Oxford comma and the overall poor writing, one side misunderstood their position and lost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First priority should always be clarity.  If a sentence is unclear, it doesn't matter if it's grammatically correct.</p>
<p>In some cases, the Oxford comma adds clarity.  In those cases, it should always be used.<br />
EX 1a:  This comment is dedicated to my parents, Ayn Rand, and Joseph Stalin.  (clear)<br />
EX 1b:  This comment is dedicated to my parents, Ayn Rand and Joseph Stalin.  (unclear)</p>
<p>In other cases, the Oxford comma removes clarity.  In those cases, it should never be used.<br />
EX 2a:  This comment is dedicated to my mother, Ayn Rand, and Joseph Stalin.  (unclear)<br />
EX 2b:  This comment is dedicated to my mother, Ayn Rand and Joseph Stalin.  (clear)</p>
<p>The real debate is whether it should be used when the meaning is clear either way.  Some argue that it should always be used in these case, while others argue that it should always be left out.  In most cases, it's just a question of consistent style.</p>
<p>Personally, I consider it optional, except in the cases listed above.  I prefer to use it, but have no problem with others leaving it out.</p>
<p>Either way, clarity always wins over grammar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The wikipedia page (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial\_comma" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial\_comma</a></a>) goes into details about it. But here are the main arguments against:</p>
<ol>
<li>The comma may introduce ambiguity: If you want to thanks 3 entities, if you don't use the Oxford comma you get &quot;To my mother, Ayn Rand and God&quot;, which is <del>clearly</del> a list of 3 entities (mother; named girl; God), while if you use the Oxford comma you get  &quot;To my mother, Ayn Rand, and God&quot; which could be interpreted as 2 entities (named mother; God) instead of the 3 intended.</li>
<li>Where space is at a premium, the comma adds unnecessary bulk to the text.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'd also add my own additional point of view: A comma in a sentence means that you're expected to make a pause when reading aloud. I would not read &quot;I like apples, bananas and chocolate.&quot; and &quot;I like apples, bananas**,** and chocolate&quot; exactly the same way. And I will in writing the one I would have used when talking at this moment (which depends on the emphasis I put on words, and probably many other things).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
