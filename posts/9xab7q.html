		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We give sleeping-aid type meds to patient. Small dose = make sleepy. Larger dose = slow down brain activity. Even larger dose = stop brain activity completely. Somewhere between larger dose and even larger dose is comatose state.</p>
<p>Brain activity consumes oxygen. If brain is very active (seizures) or body don't have a lot of oxygen to give (cardiac arrest), then brain gets unhappy when active. We make patient comatose to keep brain slow and happy. </p>
<p>Those are the 2 big reasons.</p>
<p>There are other reasons, like when your lungs are injured (acute hypoxic respiratory failure), or the brain is sick and sending out garbage signals to your body (acute encephalopathy). In these cases, it's a good idea to turn off the body for a while, until the injury heals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Coma is a slightly outdated term that is used a lot in the media but not in hospitals. </p>
<p>What I think you are talking about is when patients are heavily sedated in ICU. We do this for several reasons, including to prevent agitation/discomfort, to prevent dislodgement of the various tubes and lines that are attached to the patient, to lower the blood pressure/heart rate/ metabolic demands of the tissues. </p>
<p>For example if somebody is ventilated, and would die without that support, but is agitated and flailing around, we need to sedate them so they don’t pull the ventilator tube out. If someone has had a heart attack but is stressed and agitated, we need to sedate them to keep their blood pressure low so their heart isn’t working too hard. </p>
<p>In the above examples, we use just enough sedation to achieve what we need without oversedating them. They would probably still be slightly rousable. </p>
<p>If someone has had a cardiac arrest, a brain haemorrhage, or major head trauma it is important to sedate them properly so that they are not rousable - this is probably what you understand as a “medically induced coma”. This is done to slow down brain function to the point where it is not using much oxygen and needs little blood flow. This is done to minimise the chances of ongoing damage to the brain from an increased metabolic demand that is unmet. </p>
<p>In terms of how this is done, there are several agents available. Propofol infusion is the most common in the UK. Others may include midazolam, opiates, ketamine, thiopentone, dexmedetomidine, or even inhaled anaesthetic vapours. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If someone hits their head really, really hard, or if their heart stops beating, the best way to let their brain and body recharge is to put them in battery saver mode, like on your iPad. This way their body uses very little energy and gives them time to recharge. We put them in battery saver mode with medicine that makes them sleep. This medicine makes the brain and body use less battery power so that more battery power can be spent on healing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My father was in an induced coma due to a brain injury caused by infection. It was hard to safely awaken him and I remember there were several attempts (eventually successful!). Why is it difficult and what problems/signs of problems might have been encountered? </p>
<p>I tried to ask the nurses/doctors but this happened in Spain and my Spanish vocabulary at the time didn't extend to medical terms. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ICU RN here. Sometimes we not only sedate a patient, but we also cool them down. Referred to internally as ‘hypothermia protocol’, but officially as ‘targeted temperature management’, the procedure involves someone who has had cardiac arrest, CPR, their heartbeat returning, but they aren’t neurologically 100%. To maximize the brain’s ability to recover its recent brief stint without oxygen, we slow down the body’s metabolism by cooling it.</p>
<p>By cooling the body’s core temperature to &lt;95F, the brain can do whatever it needs to do in an environment where the body isn’t using so much of the energy that that brain can otherwise use for healing. This is done with cooling blankets, ice, and more recently a cooling suit.</p>
<p>Now, this is extremely uncomfortable, so the patient is managed by sedating them into a coma-like state. Technically a coma is defined (at least in our charting) as a lack of any response. We typically prefer our patients to be in a ‘happy place’ of sorts where they are able to open their eyes to stimulation, but not strong or aware enough to keep them open. This means the medicine is providing the amnesiac effect while minimizing other problems. Although to fight shivering, and to make sure the patient is never strong enough to pull out their endotracheal tube, it’s sometimes safer to sink into a deeper sedation until we can balance the amount of sedative needed for the 24 hours of cooling required by protocol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
