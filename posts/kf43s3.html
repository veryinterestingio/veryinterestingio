<p>Amazon is lousy with fake reviews. Sure, they have policies for sellers if they're caught, but they, as far as I can tell, don't go looking and don't usually follow up on reports from customers (I know I've reported a handful of blatantly obviously fake reviews and they didn't get taken down).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>YSK about fakespot.com. Put in a link from one of their supported sites (including Amazon) and it gives the reviews a grade for authenticity. They've helped me avoid a lot of crap products with high review ratings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You buy item, write review, take pic, show proof, they refund you almost instantly. </p>
<p>I got like 20+ pairs of cheap headphones, knock off fit bits, bike lights... literally anything I wanted. </p>
<p>I delete the reviews after though.  Scamming the scammer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>An ex girlfriend use to write reviews for companies on amazon. They did this for a ton of major and small businesses.</p>
<p>LPT: don't base anything off the reviews unless you can tell the person is genuine. If you think it's bullshit, it likely is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do not. And to make matters worse many of the reviews left from real customer are either fake or coerced. In my own personal experience I left a three star review on google for a local building company I spent around one hundred thousand dollars with. I then I received a letter from the companies lawyers demanding I either amend or take down the review I left because it would cost their revenue. I hired a lawyer who said this happens all the time and said companies that have only 5 star reviews are more likely to engage in faking reviews or suing to maintain their stats. Personally I trust companies more who leave up those low star reviews. If they have thousands of 5 star I think they are fake.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
