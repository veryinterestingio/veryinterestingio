		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They have the same genome yes. And it shouldn't be that surprising, the same genome that produces your eye is the same genome which produces your kidneys, two very different organs. One of the biggest discoveries from the human genome project was that the absolute number of genes is not that high, it's the regulation of expression and splicing which allows for the huge amount of diversity in tissues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they are the same organism and share the same genome.  However, there are certainly major changes in gene expression that occur during metamorphosis as various developmental genes are activated or inactivated respectively.  I recommend <a href="http://www.biologiaevolutiva.org/xbelles/pdfs/2011-Belles-ELS.pdf" target="_blank">this review article</a> by Belles 2011, which is a good source of general information about insect metamorphosis.</p>
<p>For several decades now, it's been know that this process is initially triggered by hormonal signals, the most important of which are <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/AllJH.svg/1280px-AllJH.svg.png" target="_blank">juvenile hormones</a> (JH).  As the name implies, juvenile hormone is present at high levels in larvae, and metamorphosis begins once levels of JH drop below a certain threshold; this also means that exposing insects to JH can indefinitely prevent them from maturing to adulthood (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022191008000267?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">source</a>).  This property was somewhat unpleasantly discovered by Vincent Wigglesworth when he attached larvae of different stages together so they shared body fluids, which you can see in <a href="https://imgur.com/WMvyI0H" target="_blank">figure 3</a> from the Belles 2011 article I already linked.</p>
<p>So we know that the levels of hormones like this are responsible for <em>causing</em> metamorphosis, but the mechanics of how it happens on a genetic level are somewhat more complicated.  The main group of genes associated with metamorphosis appears to be the &quot;Broad-Complex&quot; of genes, named after the <a href="https://www.wikigenes.org/e/gene/e/44505.html" target="_blank">broad gene</a> in fruit flies.  This family of genes encodes transcription factor proteins that go on to regulate the expression of over 100 other genes (including themselves), and some of those downstream genes regulated by the Broad-Complex are themselves transcription factors (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8076529" target="_blank">source</a>).  There has been some work done to trace the labyrinthine web of relationships among these various developmental genes to figure out some of the finer details of how metamorphosis actually happens, but it's beyond the scope of my knowledge on this topic and this post is already long enough as it is.</p>
<p>In summary then, caterpillars and butterflies do indeed share all the same genes, but the changes that occur during their life cycle are based on the selective activation and repression of different groups of genes at different times.  From the outside, a freshly emerged butterfly may appear to be a completely different organism, but careful study has shown that there are clear anatomical connections between the larval and adult stages.  For example, insect larvae have blobs called <a href="https://www.sdbonline.org/sites/fly/lewheld/fig11.jpg" target="_blank">imaginal discs</a> composed of cells that already have specific preordained fates in the adult stage (<a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(10)00291-5.pdf" target="_blank">source</a>).  And to reference another neat experiment, it's been shown that memories from the larval stages can be retained as adults, so there definitely isn't any kind of sneaky switcheroo going on in between (<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001736" target="_blank">source</a>).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The insect genome will include instructions to build a larva, instructions to build a pupa, and instructions to build an adult. No need to change the genome during life. There's no known mechanism for that sort of large-scale rewriting anyway. And if there was, the information for the new version would have to come from SOMEWHERE, and therefore would need to already be in the genome.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>More interesting (to me anyway) is they don't just grow some parts and lose others, they completely break down to a slimy goo and reassemble as a butterfly. However, if you teach the caterpillar a particular behavior the butterfly still remembers it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other posters have answered the question, but I want to include an interesting side point: a few years ago there was an infamous paper published in PNAS that claimed butterflies and caterpillars were different species. It was so obviously wrong that there was a big controversy about how it got published in the first place.
