<p>100 people is about 100x the energy, which will <del>triple</del> add 20 to the decibels.</p>
<p>The scale is built that way because your ears aren’t linear either.  You can hear a fly buzzing and the roar of a passing freight train.  One is billions of times more energetic than the other, but you don’t experience it as a billion times louder and explode your skull.</p>

<p>Theres more to it though. </p>
<p>Sounds are pressure waves travelling through space. Lets define the normal pressure of the atmosphere as zero (it isnt strictly, but the math gets easier). At the 'peak' of the pressure wave, we have a pressure of +A. At the lowest point, we have a pressure of -A. What you perceive as 'loudness' is essentially this value A.</p>
<p>Not imagine you have two waves and &quot;add&quot; them. </p>
<ul>
<li>It could be that the peak of wave 1 is in the same position as the peak of wave 2. In this case, you get a new wave, with an 'Amplitude' (Amplitude is essentially the &quot;height&quot; of the wave) 2A. </li>
<li>It could also be, that the peak of wave 1 is exactly where the valley of wave 2 is. In this case, the waves cancel each other out completely. Thats how noise cancellation headphones work btw.</li>
</ul>
<p>In reality, its usually something in between, and it gets further complicated by the fact that not all waves have the same frequency, so they cancel each other out in some places and amplify each other in others.</p>
<p>I hope this gives you an idea why sound waves just down simply add up linearly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>There are really 3 ways to measure sound levels.  The sound pressure level is where your intuitive math works, this is measuring the height of the pressure waves in the air and they'll add a lot closer to how you expect.  dB converts the sound pressure into a more useful scale because there are 10 zeros between the quietest thing you can hear and the loudest sound something can make.  Perceived loudness is a scale factor on top of the dB measurement, again because there are 10 zeros between loud and quiet your brain/body hear logrithmically rather than linearly so something 10 dB louder sounds 2x louder to you.</p>
<p>If your baseline is one person singing a single note at 60 dB then they're creating a sound pressure swing of 0.02 Pa.  If you have 100 people all singing exactly the same note and exactly in phase then you could get up to 2 Pa which is 100x higher, but a 2 Pa sound pressure level is just 100 dB so it sounds about 16x louder</p>
<p>In reality you'll never get them singing exactly the same note perfectly in phase so your real measurements would all be lower, but that example should help with some of the weird math you see in sound measurements</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
