		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to a 2014 study published in JAMA Internal Medicine, an increase of added sugar in the diet has a correlation with a a higher risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. The exact mechanism is unknown but is thought to have multiple pathways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sugar can overload the liver - the liver metabolizes sugar and converts carbohydrates to fat. Fatty liver disease is a factor in developing diabetes</li>
<li>Sugar raises blood pressure and inflammation</li>
<li>Sugar intake contributes to weight gain</li>
</ol>
<p>All of the above are correlated with heart disease</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don’t have my sources in front of me, but you can look up the Metabolic Syndrome. Here is an abstract of a review:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24711954/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24711954/</a></p>
<p>In short, prolonged high sugar intake causes increased insulin release. High levels of insulin leads to insulin insensitivity because your cells “get used to” the high levels and it is less effective. While this is happening, your body enters a pro-inflammatory, pro-clotting state because of an increase in certain cytokines and enzymes in circulation. Bear in mind that other thugs are happening with this as well.</p>
<p>These pro inflammatory changes affect the blood vessels and cause them to not function as well. This leads to inflammation of the vessel walls and deposition of cholesterol and fatty acids in the vessel walls (atherosclerosis). Chronic buildup can lead to vessel occlusion or rupture and clotting, that can lead to coronary artery disease.</p>
<p>Decreasing sugar intake and improving physical health to a level to no longer qualify for the metabolic syndrome can improve or even reverse some of these changes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fructose, a sugar present in a lot of sugary foods, has been shown to increase metabolic syndrome, a collection of symptons that can include or lead to heart disease.
As fructose is broken down in the body it turns into Uric acid and so increased fructose consumption can lead to &quot;hyperuricemia&quot; which has been independently shown to be a major contributor to metabolic syndrome.
While this is not a perfect answer, and I'm not entirely sure on the relationship between metabolic syndrome and heart disease, it could be a way in which high fructose consumption can lead to increased chance of heart disease!
I'm on my phone at the moment so can't easily link sources but can add some later! (Google fructose hyperuricemia metabolic syndrome etc  if you're interested!) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s not directly from the sugar compound itself. It’s from the long term effects that comes with consuming excess sugar (arteries clog up with fatty deposits, blood pressure rises etc.) that leads to cardiovascular diseases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
