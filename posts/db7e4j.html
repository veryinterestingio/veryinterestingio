<p>This question, often referred to as the &quot;baryon asymmetry problem&quot;, is one of the major open questions in elementary physics.</p>
<p>It's natural to assume that matter and antimatter would've been created in equal quantities in the big bang, but the fact that there seems to be a very large imbalance implies that some physical laws apply differently to matter than they do to antimatter. For now, it's an open problem and no complete answer to the baryon asymmetry  problem has been found.</p>
<p>So the solution to this problem is left as an exercise to the reader.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The matter/antimatter asymmetry is one of the big open questions in modern physics. The leading explanation is baryogenesis, which requires the breaking of the charge conjugation (C) and parity (P) symmetries. CP-violation is present in the Standard Model, but the amount appears to be too small to explain the observed matter/antimatter asymmetry, suggesting new physics remains to be discovered. Many Beyond the Standard Model theories include additional sources of CP violation that may account for this, and there is significant experimental and theoretical effort in the community to more precisely measure CP-violating processes to look for evidence of deviation from the Standard Model, although at the moment no clear evidence exists.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Related question, how do we know there is more matter than anti matter?  How do we know some of the galaxy clusters and superclusters we see are not anti matter galaxies?  </p>
<p>It seems possible to me that matter and anti-matter could have been distributed unevenly by the Big Bang and over time areas with more matter eliminated all the anti-matter and vice versa.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If there must be symmetry in nature, and time is a dimension just like the three for space, then from the Big Bang at the origin of the universe (say, 0,0,0,0 in all dimensions), when a certain amount of matter is exploding forwards in time, maybe the same amount of antimatter would be exploding backwards in time.  Then you end up with a universe that has the exact same history as ours (assuming hard determinism based on all matter and energy working like a Rube Goldberg machine), but physically reversed and time flows backwards (though seemingly &quot;forwards&quot; from anyone's perspective there) and is made of antimatter.  </p>
<p>While that wouldn't explain why the universes before and after the Big Bang have either more matter or antimatter depending on the &quot;side&quot; you're on, it would mean there's an equal amount if you look at all of spacetime as a whole.  Also explains why we can't observe it, because it's existing on the other side of the Big Bang, that is, in the past from our perspective, and moving farther (and earlier) away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
