Surely holes in masks are the same size no matter whether the germs are heading in or out, but I'm guessing it's not about the holes and I'm missing something.</p>
<p>Obligatory disclaimer: I'm not an anti-masker, I'm still wearing it in shops for example. This is just me wanting to understand.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so many people in here are saying that you primarily catch Covid from surfaces.</p>
<p>This is very much <strong>not true</strong></p>
<p>We don't. It's actually extremely rare.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00251-4" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00251-4</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7333993/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7333993/</a></p>
<p>The more important reason here is the aerosol concentration in the air. When there's a lot of particles that carry Covid in the air, some of those particles will simply find a way to squeeze by your mask, be it through a crack or some of the fibers of a non-FFP2 mask.</p>
<p>This is obviously more likely to happen at higher concentration.</p>
<p>This is the biggest thing: The amount of Covid is in the air is the most important factor.</p>
<p>By wearing masks, <strong>most</strong> of the particles you exhale will be trapped in your mask. This reduces the concentration in the air around you and makes it safer for every other person in the room.</p>
<p>Guys, I say this very often on here, but please validate what you are saying before saying it. There's large amounts of misinformation in here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's imagine that you are not wearing pants, you are drunk, and you just randomly piss.  You might randomly piss on someone else.   And no one else is wearing pants either so when they piss, they piss on you.   Now imagine that you put on pants.  And now when you piss the piss is mostly stopped by your pants and very little of it will get on anyone else.  Other people would have to touch your pants to get your piss on them.    But other people can still piss on your pants if they are not wearing pants.  You still get their piss on your pants and it will soak through and your legs get wet from piss.   Now imagine that everyone is wearing pants.   Everyone pisses on their own pants and no one gets pissed on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Partly the saying is overselling a bit, masks do help both ways, they're just more effective at stopping spreading than they are at stopping catching.</p>
<p>It's because when you cough/sneeze/breath it's not just gases that leave your mouth, there's lots of small water droplets as well.</p>
<p>The water droplets either fall straight to the floor because they're too heavy or they float around and might slowly evaporate away leaving just the virus and whatever else behind.</p>
<p>Masks are very good at stopping droplets which have recently been released but they're less effective the smaller they get, the droplets are biggest when they're first sneezed/coughed so that's when a mask has the best effect.</p>
<p>Also not all masks are equal, if you get yourself a good enough mask then it will basically be just as good either way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The flat masks that the majority of people wear are designed to simply stop us from projecting all of our germs on everyone else. Instead of blowing out a large plume of respiratory particles we just have small cloud around our faces. Air is still able to flow around our masks and thus we can still breathe in what is in the air around us.  A respirator or n-95 type dust mask needs to be fitted, and when worn correctly will filter particles from the air. This will effectively reduce infection rates.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
