		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because &quot;two by four&quot; is easier to say than &quot;one and a half by three and a half&quot;. Long ago, the wood was just raw cut from the sawmill and whanged together into a house. But raw wet wood has bugs and moisture. As it dries it warps. Consumers don't like warped houses or bugs, so to satisfy demand they started pressing, straightening and drying the wood before hand. But they never changed the size or jigs of the saws that cut the wood out of the log, which is always wet.</p>
<p>Carpenters, happy to not have to deal with warped buggy wood simply adjusted to the fact that a 2x4 was really 1.5x3.5, and made the corresponding adjustments when they were drawing out their framing etc.** Any carpenter or framer who is any good knows the true dimensions of a board and can deal with it probably without even thinking about it. Us weekend warriors though have to be careful to do real world lumber math. </p>
<p>Having said that you can get true size treated lumber (a 2x4 that is actually 2x4) but it will cost you a fortune.</p>
<p>**and this adjustment happened so long ago and just became &quot;standard&quot; accepted practise that noone ever bothered to go back and change it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the west all douglas fir framing lumber is sold and used wet.  Dry DF is as hard as a rock and hard to work with.</p>
<p>My experience says all rough cut DF is near, but not exact, labeled dimension. One side is planed off 1/4, perfectly smooth. The next side is planed exactly to the reqquired  dimension, (1.5 for instance). 1/4inch, more or less, is removed, leaving a perfectly smooth surface.  All dimensioned lumber is &quot;cleaned up&quot; like this.  A &quot;4x6&quot; is 3.5 x5.5.  Framing is a system where a 4x6 must sit perfectly on a 2x4, the sides remain exactly flush. This rule follows all dimensions. larger or smaller, used in construction. If it varies more than 1/16 it's a problem.</p>
<p>Rough cut means the 4 sides do not have to be planed or be perfect dimension so it is less expensive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the UK it is based on whether the timber is planed or not. Unplaned  timber is called the nominal  size, so  50mm x 100mm (which is near enough 2 x 4)  actually is 50 x 100.  Unplaned timber has a rough finish and is generally  used a lot outside or where it can't be seen.</p>
<p>Planed timber, (finished)  is now mostly sold as 50 x 100 but is actually 44 x 94 ish. (Sizes differ a bit between different timber merchants.) The 50 x 100 unplaned timber is run through a planer thereby losing 3 mm on each side.  In some places you can buy accurate stated sizes. Planed timber feels smooth and doesn't need much finishing. You could paint straight onto it generally. Its the wood you would see inside your house - skirting boards, plank, floorboard, door liners, trims and architraves. (Your doors, windows and furniture are probably not made from planed timber since joiners who make these tend to size and plane their own better grade lumber.)</p>
<p>Sheet material sizes are accurate.</p>
<p>It's a pain basically, especially when you are using a lot of different sizes and trying to design and cost something. It's another 'economy' passed onto the customer to sort out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A  couple of points to add, and this from a former NELMA Lumber Inspector. They use 'green lumber' sizes{i.e. that from the saw first into a plank or? to use a reference point. The sizes have changed over the years, I think they are getting smaller now- tho I have been retired for some years. The standard, planned, sizes were needed for mass production methods, and mass transit needs. And do not forget the extra money that comes from the shavings sold. If the mills sawed, dried, and sold a real '2x4' where would the extra profit come from? Thankfully for me, my little town has a Real sawmill; I can get any size I need to restore my circa 1812 house, without the horrors of plywood, chip board, and the Big Box 'lumber.</p>
<p>And a further tidbit; this same house has wall studs that are rough cut on just two sides, and used for studs in the house. This saves time and work, in addition, leaving the bark on is better for the wood, and it  helps to keep the bugs out of the wood. The original sub floor, is one standard thickness, but random width, the thickness determined by the saw, and not a planner.  We are quite spoiled in this era of power everything tools</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
