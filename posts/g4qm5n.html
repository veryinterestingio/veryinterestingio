		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's always a balance.</p>
<p>Number of blades:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fewer blades = More efficient shoveling of air because of turbulence (air swirls) created by other blades reduces efficiency. Usually simpler to make.</li>
<li>More blades = More stable because the force is spread out over more blades and shovels more air compared to how long the propellers are.</li>
</ul>
<p>Propeller tips breaking sound barrier is bad (because of lots of turbulence). The longer the propeller the faster the tips go compared to the center. But having too short blades means more loss of energy at the blade tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Longer blades = Better at generating lift, shoveling more air at lower speeds. Longer propellers also less stable and vibrate more.</li>
<li>Smaller blades = Allows higher top speeds since the propeller can go much faster without breaking the soundbarrier with the wingtips. More stable.</li>
</ul>
<p>So basicly.WW1 airplane: We can't make so good engines. So we're gonna go with efficient short two-bladed propellers because that gives is the most thrust for our weak engines.</p>
<p>WW2 airplane: We gots a lot better engines now. But two-bladed propellers can't shovel enough air to take our planes as fast as we're going to go. So we're going to go with 4 short blades!</p>
<p>Helicopter: We gotta generate lots of lift. So we're going to go with longer and slower rotating blades!</p>
<p>Modern helicopter: Uh. Those blades aren't generating enough lift. MORE BLADES! More blades is harder to make, but more stable too.</p>
<p>Modern turboprop: Too noisy! We're making special 6 bladed propellers that are much quieter. And computer power and advanced materials allows us to make them special advanced shapes that generate even less noise and more power. So now they look more like ship propellers. But for air! Still kinda short blades because we gotta go fast!</p>
<p>Ship propellers: Water dense yo. So we gotta make blades short (or they'll break!) but we make them much wider to shovel a lot of water backwards.</p>
<p>P.S: Jet engines work entirely differently, even if they do have fans at the front they're for compressing air into the engine, not generating thrust.  </p>
<p>P.P.S: For ceiling fan. You're moving lots of air, but you want to do it slowly and silently. So lots of wide blades. How long the blades are depends on how mobile you want the fan to be. Big fan = more air silently. Small fan = Noisier, but more mobile.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Next time you’re in a swimming pool try moving your hand through the water as fast as you can. Change the angle a bit and notice that you push more or less water around. Now try it again with your whole arm under water. You can push more water around but it also requires much more effort. </p>
<p>Propellor optimization (fans are just propellers) involves striking a balance between the amount of fluid you want to move at the energy used to move it. Increasing the surface area of the propellor will move more fluid but require more energy to operate. This can be achieved by increasing either the size of the blades, the number of blades, or both. </p>
<p>A house fan only needs to move relatively little air at high efficiency. A speedboat propeller is going to be optimized to move water. Many airplanes also have the ability to change the angle of their blades, taking a larger or smaller “bite” out of the air without changing the surface area exposed to the medium.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's my best shot at an ELIF: </p>
<p>Generally, the more blades you have (and the larger they are) the slower and quieter the fan will be. It all has to do with resistance. You'll notice that a lot of helicopters only have four really skinny blades; Super fast, and SUPER loud. </p>
<p>Very interesting question, kid!</p>
<p>Edited to say it wasn't as hard as I thought to make it simple lol</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its a balance between a lot of factors</p>
<p>Each additional blade adds more weight and cost which requires stronger($$$) engine components to overcome the increased drag from additional blades trying to move through the air.  They also disturb the air they pass through so having 8 blades instead of 4 won't give you twice the power because the extra blades are now passing through disturbed air and not working as efficiently.  Generally you get better results from increasing the length of the propeller but this requires a stronger propeller($$$)</p>
<p>Generally the better option is to have a second cheap engine/propeller set (think twin engine propeller planes or the Chinook), or to use more elaborate propeller setups like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra-rotating_propellers" target="_blank">Contra-Rotating propellers</a> which boosts propeller efficiency giving you more thrust with the same horsepower despite driving two different sets of blades.  This was used on the later Spitfires to get the most power possible out of their limited propeller diameter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One video I remember and is kind of relevant (wind turbines) could maybe help you slightly.</p>
<p>I don't know how to link on mobile but the video is on YouTube by &quot;Real Engineering&quot; and is called &quot;why do wind turbines have three blades&quot;. There's also a second video with the same title on the channel called &quot;DOB-Academy studio&quot;. They give you some more info.</p>
<p>The videos should take you around 3 minutes to watch and they can explain the topic much better than me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
