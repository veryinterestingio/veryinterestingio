		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An international team of astronomers, including researchers from the UK, US and Japan, has found a rare molecule - phosphine - in the clouds of Venus. On Earth, this gas is only made industrially or by microbes that thrive in oxygen-free environments. Astronomers have speculated for decades that high clouds on Venus could offer a home for microbes - floating free of the scorching surface but needing to tolerate very high acidity. The detection of phosphine could point to such extra-terrestrial &quot;aerial&quot; life as astronomers have ruled out all other known natural mechanisms for its origin.</p>
<p>Signs of phosphine were first spotted in observations from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), operated by the East Asian Observatory, in Hawai'i. Astronomers then confirmed the discovery using the more-sensitive Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), in which the European Southern Observatory (ESO) is a partner. Both facilities observed Venus at a wavelength of about 1 millimetre, much longer than the human eye can see - only telescopes at high altitude can detect it effectively.</p>
<p>Details on the discovery can be read here: <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso2015/" target="_blank">https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso2015/</a></p>
<p>We are a group of researchers who have been involved in this result and experts from the facilities used for this discovery. We will be available on Wednesday, 16 September, starting with 16:00 UTC, 18:00 CEST (Central European Summer Time), 12:00 EDT (Eastern Daylight Time). Ask Us Anything!</p>

<ol>
<li>What is the likelihood of such life being ejected off earth by major impact events in that time, finding their way onto other worlds and thriving under the right set of circumstances? </li>
<li>Is there a possibility of life to have evolved first on Venus and then get carried over to earth seeding it with life?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1, Given how little we know about Venus's interior and ongoing volcanic activity, how confident are you that it's not the source of the phosphine? I.e. is your stance more &quot;Based on some reasonable assumptions, volcanism is unlikely to be the source,&quot; or &quot;There is no reasonable possibility in any model of Venus's volcanism that it could produce anywhere near this much phosphine&quot;.</p>
<p>2, Presuming the phosphine is biotic, could we place any constraints on the biochemistry of that life based on the nature of the environment and the fact it's producing phosphine?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
