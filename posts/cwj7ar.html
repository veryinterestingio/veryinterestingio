		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My name is Margaret Race, and I work on the behind the scenes prepatation for planetary protection in planning human missions to Mars.</p>
<p>We just celebrated the 50th Anniversary of the Apollo Moon Landings, a milestone in human achievement. We've gotten so used to headlines about new technologies, far out exploration and diverse science discoveries, that we hardly think about what goes into the planning and preparation behind the scenes. It involves way more than just rocket scientists and astronauts! (How else would a marine biologist and ecologist like me end up working with NASA on missions to Mars and planetary protection!?)</p>
<p>It's surprising how many different types of people and careers are involved with NASA and the space community as they plan future missions, whether in Earth orbit, to the Moon, and someday, even to Mars. The careers and challenges will surprise you: it involves all the STEM fields -- science, technology, engineering and math-- and also includes input from an assortment of other fields, from law, ethics, and emergency management, to communications, movie making and even philosophy. To paraphrase Dr. Seuss: Oh, the places we'll go... and the careers we need! AMA about the assorted questions that are addressed in planning long duration space missions beyond Earth.</p>
