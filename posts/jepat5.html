		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don’t work with individual particles at a time, we create beams of many particles. The particles start in a source, where you usually heat up some material, maybe shoot microwaves at it, and create a plasma. Once you’ve got it in a plasma form, you can manipulate it using electric fields to pull out particles of a certain charge (positive or negative). From then on, it’s just guiding the beam around with electric (at low energies) and magnetic (at high energies) fields, and accelerating them with electric fields.</p>
<p>The process of extracting particles from the source is not 100% efficient, but you still get a beam out.</p>
<p>When the beam is still at low energies, focusing is done with electrostatic fields. Once the beam is moving pretty fast, it becomes more efficient to focus them with magnetic fields. In either case, electrodes or coils of wire are shaped in just the right way to provide focusing of the beam just like a lens focuses light.</p>
<p>As for other particles getting in the way, everywhere the beam propagates is usually held under vacuum (for charged particle beams).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR:  By analogy, this is a bit like setting up an experiment to study the debris field after a high speed collision of a truck and a train, and asking &quot;how do we know the truck didn't hit a car instead?&quot;  The answer is that there's lots of info in the wreckage that tells us how heavy the target was.</p>
<p>First, the accelerator is kept at a very high vacuum to avoid having the accelerated, high-energy particles accidently slam into some random atom.  It still happens, but it's usually at some random place in the accelerator that is far from where the fancy detector stuff is, so in that case, you just lose an atom out of the beam and create a little dangerous radiation at some random location far from anywhere that matters.</p>
<p>The science is done at a few key locations along the accelerator,  typically using large complex machines with many detectors.  It's possible for a beam atom to hit a &quot;bad&quot; atom inside one of these machines, which could create a confusing result.  However, the electronics are designed to really only &quot;trigger&quot; and save data when a collision occurs that matches a bunch of conditions.  A collision creates an explosion of particles and radiation coming from the place the collision occurs.  So one condition is that the particle tracks come from the tiny region (maybe a few cubic millimeters?  (depends on the accelerator) where the beam is supposed to hit a target.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If it's the kind of accelerator that uses two atomic beams that are traveling in opposite directions, they are mostly kept on separate paths which are focused to cross in this tiny volume.<br />
Also, if it's a two-beams-colliding system, you can figure out from the data if it was like a head-on collision between two equal size cars traveling at the same speed in opposite directions or like a car at high speed hit a parked car.  In the first case, the debris (particles and radiation) are scattered in both directions, but in the second case most of the debris is scattered in one direction only.  The detector electronics include circuits to spot this difference very quickly in the processing, and can make a decision to record the collision or not.  (Recording the collision takes time, so if it's not a good collision, it's best to just reset the detector quickly and wait for a good collision rather than read out all the data.</p>
<p>Finally, suppose a beam atom collides with an &quot;bad&quot; atom at the right location, and the circuits make a mistake so the data is recorded.  This can definitely happen for accelerators that use a single beam which strikes a fixed target, because, for instance, an atom of oxygen might be stuck on the surface of the target right where the beam is focused.  </p>
<p>In this case, the data gets recorded, but when all the data is analyzed, this one collision is probably going to be rejected because the analysis software is always looking for rare events that meet certain requirements that match whatever the scientists are looking for.  40 years ago, the detectors and electronics weren't as sophisticated, so this could be a problem.  Nowadays, these detectors are super complicated, typically with at least hundreds (more like tens of thousands) of separate detector elements and readout electronics.  That's mostly because they're looking for super rare events (like, the truck hit the train, and the truck driver and train driver both flew out, bounced off each other, and landed safely at least 20 meters away.)  But it also makes it pretty easy to spot the bad collisions (truck hit car).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A particle accelerator starts with an ion source that makes ions of some specific type. For example positive ions of hydrogen are just protons. These ions are accelerated by some means. Simple accelerators use a big electric voltages like in a Tandem or Van de Graaff accelerator. The ions are then focused into a beam. One measures the current in the beam to determine the number of ions per second being place on the target.</p>
<p>Now, there may be particles everywhere but most of them are due to the high energy particle beam. Those that aren't like natural radioactive decay or cosmic rays are much smaller in number and are treated as an unwanted but quantified background.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We cannot isolate certain particles whatsoever. It is a probability game and in reality we are performing many collisions a second. Basically if you have enough dice to roll at high enough energy, you might create these rare particles. Special detectors are built for different particle types, but it is common to use Electromagnetic filters. Magnets can filter based on charge to mass ratio, electric fields based on charge, and beam dumps high nuclear interaction cross-section. Most particles exist for such a small period of time that we can only detect their outgoing products, so we look for an excess of certain products at the given mass range. Examples include the Higgs: <a href="http://cosmologyscience.com/cosblog/wp-content/uploads/HiggsbumpCMS.jpg" target="_blank"><a href="http://cosmologyscience.com/cosblog/wp-content/uploads/HiggsbumpCMS.jpg" target="_blank">http://cosmologyscience.com/cosblog/wp-content/uploads/HiggsbumpCMS.jpg</a></a> or for more see CMS's spectrum <a href="https://www.quantumdiaries.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cms_DimuonSpectrum-300x209.png" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.quantumdiaries.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cms\_DimuonSpectrum-300x209.png" target="_blank">https://www.quantumdiaries.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cms\_DimuonSpectrum-300x209.png</a></a>.  A large part of being able to detect or measure something is separating the signal from the background.  </p>
<p>An example of a collider set-up is shown here <a href="http://collider.physics.ox.ac.uk/detecting.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://collider.physics.ox.ac.uk/detecting.html" target="_blank">http://collider.physics.ox.ac.uk/detecting.html</a></a> at the Atlas Detector. Notice how each particle group is separated based on how it interacts, and what it can pass through, muons being charged particles capable of passing through everything. A large part of what is sought when reconstructing an &quot;event&quot; is coincidence- multiple particles or a &quot;jet&quot; of particles occurring at the same time. </p>
<p>Getting the particles in general into an accelerator depends on the type of accelerator. The most well known are probably proton beams, but there are photon beams (TUNL), electron beams (Jefferson Lab), Neutron beams (Oakridge), and even specialty beams such as anti-proton and muon (Fermilab). You start with a source, for protons that is simply ionized  Hydrogen, for electrons that might be a hot cathode, and you start to step it up with electric fields using magnetic fields to focus the beam. Generally this goes though a few different accelerator phases until you reach the experimental hall or detector locations at the highest energy. The particles collide with another beam or a fixed target.   </p>
<p>If you want to learn more there are a lot of sources, but start with the basics of Electromagnetism. In the US there is probably a particle accelerator lab near you that has visiting areas, which is especially great if you can get into old experiments. Here is a quick list: California - SLAC at Stanford, Midwest- Fermilab in Batavia IL, MidAtlantic- Jefferson Lab in Norfolk VA and TUNL in Durham NC, Northeast -Brookhaven in Upton NY, Southwest- Los Alamos (less particle accelerator focused but a key research group for it and neutrons), and there are even more if you consider medical accelerators.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
