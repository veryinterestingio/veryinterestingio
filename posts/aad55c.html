The whiskey before it is put into barrels is just alcohol and water, so what gives?  </p>
<p>Also, why can't we find out what the specific compounds are in really expensive bottles of whiskey, synthesize them in a lab, and then mix them with alcohol and water to produce cheaper, exact replicas of the really expensive whiskeys?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, bear with me on this one.</p>
<p>The steps in determining the chemical process are extraction, oxidation, concentration and filtration. There's evaporation and colouration in there too, but we can safely ignore those as they're secondary.</p>
<p>The extraction gets the alcohol out of a mash. It brings with it esters, fusel alcohols, aldehydes, and organic acids which impart smooth vanilla flavours. Depending on exactly how this is done, determines the initial organics profile. Even the water used is important, Scottish distilleries prize the streams which run out of peat bogs, and use peat smoke to character their malt.</p>
<p>When whisky hits a barrel, the barrel itself determines what's going to happen. The barrel should have held some other, more flavoursome, alcohol in its previous life, such as port or brandy for a nice Scotch, but virgin barrels can be used for whisky too.</p>
<p>Alcohol and water are great solvents, and they leach chemicals out of the barrel. If the barrel has been charred (and if not, what you're making is drain cleaner or rocket fuel, not whisky!) then this imparts combustion products into the wood, from breakdown of lignins. (Edit: I should have noted this at the time, but whisky producers call this caramelisation. It isn't strictly caramelisation, but it's fairly close)</p>
<p>This charring gets you the esters and phenols. In time, the organics, including those from the charred barrel, will oxidise, as a barrel is not an entirely sealed environment and wood is porous. Alcohol will evaporate (the &quot;angels' share&quot;) and oxygen gets in. This is considered good. After about twenty years, everything that's going to oxidise probably already has.</p>
<p>The main &quot;whisky taste&quot; is cis-3-methyl-4-octanolide, a lactone very important for whisky, and responsible for the coconut aroma of a good Scotch. The other compounds important are congeners and fusel alcohols. Fusel alcohols are extremely bad tasting and too much is a fault, but you need some for the harsh character. Congeners are other organics, like branched alcohols, esters, aldehydes and ketones. These typically oxidise to aldehydes and ketones and can contain several functional groups as a result.</p>
<p>We know all of these and we can manufacture or isolate them.</p>
<p>So yes, you can synthesise a good whisky, but everyone's definition of &quot;good whisky&quot; is different, because it is art, not science. It's much like a lab diamond, it's &quot;not real&quot;, even if it is chemically identical.</p>
<p>What you buy in a bottle of single malt scotch is the result of many casks from many years, all blended by the master distiller and his blenders to produce that distillery's &quot;taste&quot;.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: So my first comment to get gilded combines my degree (BSc Chemistry) and booze. I think it speaks for itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Someone gave you your best answer, but if you're in a bar and want a good answer here's a simple one you can remember:</p>
<p>Casks sit on racks for years. In the summer, the liquid inside expands into the porous container, and in the winter in contracts. This happens over and over and each time the liquid brings in complex organic compounds from the wood called congeners. Each cycle a little bit is lost to the atmosphere, called the Angel's share. This is why the older a scotch is (or really any aged spirit) the more expensive. There's simply less volume to sell for more time and labor commitment. Some is also lost to the barrel and this is the Devils share, though this is more or less constant regardless of how much aging happens.
This interaction causes a lot to also happen, like allow O2 in for oxidation, and in turn atmospheric conditions. For instance, you can taste the sea salt of an Islay Scotch, which almost certainly had its rack house doors open facing the sea. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
