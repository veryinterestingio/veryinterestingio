		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A &quot;one way mirror&quot; is actually just a <em>partially transparent</em> mirror. For example, a mirror that reflects half of the light that hits it, and allows the other half to flow straight through.</p>
<p>It becomes a &quot;one way mirror&quot; only in specific circumstances - when the room on one side of the mirror/window is much brighter than the room on the other side. If it is a 50% mirror 50% window, then viewers in each room could see their own reflections (at 50% brightness), plus the transmitted light from the other room (also at 50% brightness). In this case, both rooms see the same image - they both get 50% of the brightness of each room. If one room is much brighter than the other, then that overwhelms the light from the dark room, and both rooms basically only see an image of the bright room. So it looks like a mirror if you're in the bright room, and looks like a window if you're in the dark room. This means that you can break the effect simply by turning off the lights.</p>
<p>So a one way mirror isn't a light &quot;diode&quot; that only allows light to flow one way. Light can escape through the mirror in both directions, and you won't build up light trapped between the mirrors. (And of course, no mirror or window is perfect anyway - light would get absorbed too).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of misleading answers here.</p>
<p>The answer is yes, you can, and you don't need 1 way mirrors either - but it won't work with sunlight.</p>
<p>What you are looking for is a Fabry-Perot cavity. You take two mirrors that are very reflective (say 99%) and align them to be perfectly facing each other. Now you shine a laser at the face of one of the mirrors.</p>
<p>To start with 1% of your light will go into the cavity, hit the other mirror, and 99% of that will reflect and come back to the first mirror.</p>
<p>If the separation of the two mirrors exactly matches an integer number of wavelengths of light coming from the laser then the electric fields of the input light and reflected light will interfere at the mirror, and more light will enter the cavity than you expect. This process will repeat with every bounce, and each time more light will be drawn into the space between the mirrors and less of the input light will be reflected. </p>
<p>Eventually the losses in the mirrors or in the medium between the mirrors will balance the input of new power and the cavity will reach steady state. Interestingly, at this point there is a lot of light flying back and forth between the two mirrors.</p>
<p>I suggest looking at an introduction to optical cavities or fabry -Perot etalons if you are interested. These devices are found everywhere in our modern world.
Lasers commonly use a cavity around the gain medium to generate light, and many telecommunications devices use cavities to selectively filter out light at one specific colour.
You can also find these same processes used to make the anti-reflection coatings applied to glasses or screens.</p>
<p>I personally have worked with a scientific optical cavity with a finesse of 600,000. This means that any one photon on average spends 600,000 times longer bouncing back and forth inside the cavity than it would otherwise over the length between the mirrors. </p>
<p>Also as an unrelated note, many people are telling you that one way mirrors don't exist. This is also not true: a Faraday rotator is a combination of a crystal and a magnet that can be used to build optical isolators: devices that allow light to pass in only one direction. These are commonly used to protect lasers from dangerous back reflections.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, because mirrors have loss, so everytime a ray of light hits a mirror, 1% (made up but its some non-zero number) is converted to heat, and 99% is reflected.  Since the rays are bouncing around millions of times a second the light would turn to heat quickly</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
