		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Accumulation area. Start at a ridge line and walk downward. As you move downhill, the area above you (in the sense of if water was flowing down hill, where would it go) increases. Couple large accumulation areas with even small amounts of rain and the amount of water flowing through a specific, lowland area becomes quite large. To put some numbers on it, imagine a relatively minor rain event that produced 1 mm of rain. As you increase the accumulation area though, this 1 mm of rain starts to become a large volume, e.g. over pretty small accumulation of areas of 1, 10, and 100 km^(2), this becomes 1e3, 1e4, and 1e5 m^(3) of water (or 1e6, 1e7, and 1e8 liters respectively). The total drainage area of the Colorado river is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_River#Watershed" target="_blank">618,000 km^2</a>, so it's not hard to see how even modest amounts of surface water spread out over large areas, when accumulated into a river, can equal significant flow rates/volumes. For completeness, if there was a rainfall event (unlikely) of 1mm that covered the entire Colorado river drainage, this would equate to 6.18e11 liters of water. Or, working backward, the average discharge of the Colorado is 680 m^(3)/s, so if you consider that in terms of the area and going through the dimensional analysis, that would only imply ~0.09 mm/day of rainfall on average throughout the watershed contributing to stream flow, which isn't that much.</p>
<p>Now, obviously for a watershed as large as the Colorado, not every area experiences rainfall at the same time (or at the same rate). Also, when rain falls, some of it will make it quickly and directly into streams (which in turn will flow into larger streams and so on until the water reaches the ocean and/or a lake). Other portions of the rainfall will saturate the soil, with this portion of the rainfall having a few fates, it could: (1) end up as groundwater (which some portion of will eventually make it into the stream as well after a long delay from the original rainfall event), (2) flow in the shallow subsurface downhill and end up in the stream but after a delay that is shorter than the groundwater, but longer than the &quot;overland flow&quot; that happens during the rainfall event, or (3) be utilized by plants and eventually returned to the atmosphere via transpiration. There are also long term contributions from snowmelt (i.e. precipitation falls as snow in upland areas, etc and then slowly melts, providing a steady trickle of water). But all of these contributions follow this same accumulation area relationship and what you end up with are contributions to stream flow over a range of timescales from quick (surface runoff during a storm event) to slow (groundwater and snowmelt) that are constantly contributing water to rivers.</p>
<p>EDIT: Yes, some of the water that falls as precipitation and that is either on the surface or the shallow sub-surface (soil) will also evaporate, which we often lump in with the loss back to the atmosphere from plants, i.e., evapotranspiriation. Folks can stop commenting and sending me messages about this now, hopefully.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to CrustalTrudger's explanation of how the river acts today, the Colorado River at its current volume (averaging 13-15,000 cfs and peaking at about 300,000 cfs) is not responsible for much of the downriver landscape. Toward the end of the last ice age, its volume was likely triple what we see today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've hiked a few streams, and as you go along you'll find a variety of side streams and springs that drain into it.  Keep going, and it gets smaller and smaller.  Followed a big one a couple miles into the hills, and it originated as a trickle of water coming from a storm drain.  Pretty anticlimactic, but fitting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
