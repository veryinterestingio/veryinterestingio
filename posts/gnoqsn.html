		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ferromagnetism (what most people think of as &quot;magnetic&quot; is a property of solids.  A liquid cant be magnetized in the same way.  </p>
<p>Metals are made up of a bunch of tiny little crystals.  Each crystal is a miniature magnet.  A permanent magnet has been treated in such a way that most of the mini magnets are all aligned in one direction, causing the larger chunk of metal to act as a magnet.  </p>
<p>When metal melts, it stops having crystals.  Even if the crystals survived in the liquid form, they would be able to move around and rotate, so that it would stop being magnetic very quickly even if it started all lined up.  </p>
<p>In fact, metals stop being magnetic before they melt, due to a change in the type of crystals within the metal as it heats up.  The shift in magnetism is called the &quot;Curie Temperature&quot;, and will be different for different types of metals.  </p>
<p>Blacksmiths use the Curie Temperature to estimate the temperature of steel as they heat it.  They will touch the steel with a magnet to see if it is still attracted.  When the magnet stops attracting the steel, they know it has reached a certain temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I only deal with solid-state stuff, and only peripherally with magnetic systems, but I'm not aware of any molten state that would allow for long-range ferromagnetism (what we colloquially refer to as &quot;magnetic&quot;). In principle, nearby atoms (their unpaired electrons, really) may still have short-range interactions that favour spin alignment that persist in a molten state. However, the amount of disorder in a molten state will probably be too large for the spin degree of freedom to have any effect. So no, I don't believe there would be any trace of magnetization left after a magnet melts.</p>
<p>Also, after skimming the answers so far, I want to clarify some stuff about magnetism:</p>
<p>-Materials can change their magnetic properties as a function of temperature. High temperatures destroy magnetic order due to thermal fluctuations flipping spins too much for neighbouring spins to respond to. Low temperatures will eventually quiet these fluctuations so that the spins can talk and align or anti-align (or some variant of that).</p>
<p>-Spontaneous spin alignment occurs at the Curie temperature, and the material is dubbed &quot;ferromagnetic&quot;</p>
<p>-Spontaneous anti-alignment occurs at the Neel temperature, and the material is &quot;antiferromagnetic&quot;.</p>
<p>-At temperatures beyond the magnetic ordering temperatures, where the spins are relatively independent from each other, then that can be called &quot;paramagnetic&quot;. </p>
<p>-We can also include some effects of an external magnetic field to help differentiate the response of magnetic states. Apply a field onto a ferromagnet will help align domains (portions of material with align spins), and one can observe magnetic hysteresis upon changing field. Apply a field to a paramagnet and the spins will start to align with the applied field - however, this magnetization (spin alignment) will become randomized once again when the field is turned off (after some time scale). Note that ferromagnets will retain their magnetization before/after field application, whereas paramagnets will lose theirs eventually.</p>
<p>-Nerdy tidbit: there are more magnetic states that are quite odd: spins aligning in neat textures (Skrymions), spins with glassy behaviour (Spin glass), spins that are very entangled with one another (Spin ice), and spins that want to order but are prohibited from doing so due to geometric constraints (Spin liquids)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
