		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An allergic response is a separate department of the immune response. We have antibodies called IgE that don't directly fight an infection, but will alert the body that something foreign that shouldn't be there is inside. They respond to chemicals and &quot;allergens&quot; like pollen and, depending on your make up, either don't respond to the foreign material at all, or respond negatively, or respond catastrophically where your body goes into shock and die. IgE sound awful in this perspective, but the antibody is quite important when you have foreign invaders with an agenda to wreck havoc in your body.</p>
<p>You can take a neat test at a clinic to see if you're allergic to anything. They'll give your skin a small taste of the chemical or allergen, and any redness, heat, or bumps is a sign that you respond negatively to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An allergy is an immune response involving an antibody called IgE. When this antibody responds to a threat, it alerts the body's immune system to attack. This causes your typical inflammatory response like swelling, itchiness, redness, etc. An allergy is a response to a non-dangerous substance. </p>
<p>A mosquito bite is technically an allergy that everyone has: non-dangerous substance enters your body, the area becomes swelled up, red, itchy. Some people barely feel mosquito bites, while others get huge ones.</p>
<p>As for how it develops, it's uncertain. One idea is that when a mother is exposed/consumes a variety of substances while pregnant, the fetus either recognizes that those substances are not dangerous, or the fetus dies before being born.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Simple answer: your body encounters something it doesn’t recognize or like, forms a response, next time your body sees it, remembers and overreacts. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So far most people in this thread answered what an allergy is, but not so much what causes it. I’ll try my best to put into Eli5 language.</p>
<p>Basically, your body has an immune system which is made of many types of immune cells, and these cells are constantly monitoring for foreign invaders. One type of immune cell is called the B cell. These cells are responsible for producing antibodies, which bind to specific foreign objects (like a lock and key, it has to be a match). During formation, these B cells essentially shuffle around their gene for the antibody to create randomized antibodies (the number of variations that can be made by a human has not yet been determined, but scientists argue it is at least in the millions, if not the billions!). Why does it do this? It is so that eventually ONE of them will find a specific foreign invader. Once this happens, that specific B cell will do something really cool.</p>
<p>It will multiply (mitosis) into two cells and will differentiate (change into a different cell type): A plasma cell to continue making the antibodies, and a memory B cell to allow for protection in the future. (These will continue multiplying until it’s basically an antibody factory ready to go)</p>
<p>Your body does not make all 10 million (let’s just say 10 million is the number of variations) antibody possibilities are once, because that would be wasteful. Imagine 10 million factories all running at once, but only 3 are actually needed. So in order to be efficient, your body keeps the unmatched B cells in small numbers, shuffling them around until they find a match. Then this specific B cell is multiplied and kept around in bigger numbers for the future.</p>
<p>However, these antibodies could bind to the wrong thing. Say, not a bacteria but an avocado. Or maybe that antibody binds to a certain parasite, but ALSO happens to bind to bananas. In these situations, you body has now made the MEMORY B cells and will always remember that foreign invader as a threat.</p>
<p>It is important to note that not everyone has the same genes to work with! This includes the antibody gene that B cells shuffle. So some people, based on their genetics, could never be allergic to some things, while others could easily make the wrong antibodies and thus be more susceptible to that specific allergy!</p>
<p>Gosh that was long winded, I hoped that helped somewhat! It’s tough because we don’t fully understand everything about allergy development. But most likely it is genetics, or one of your B cells accidentally got activated and now “remembers” a certain forfeit invader (avocado).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
