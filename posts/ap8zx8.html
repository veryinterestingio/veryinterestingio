		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think there are two aspects to this,both of which are talked about above.
First, there ARE common features of Down syndrome due to the affects of extra gene dosage.  This affects such variables as height (below average), weight (above average), tongue (thick), ear canals (stenotic) and eye shape.  The genes have been partially identified through individuals with only small areas of duplication.<br />
Second, we are bad at identifying differences among people with Down syndrome.  We are bad even at different ethnicities.  Down syndrome used to be called the prejudiced term Mongoloid even though the similarities to someone from Mongolia are very superficial.<br />
Still, some people with Down syndrome have mild enough features that the diagnosis can be very delayed.  It is typical for lay people (and medical students) to not recognize an infant as having down syndrome. I personally made the first diagnosis in a four year old!  At present, the diagnosis is usually made prenatally and, in many countries, it is rare for a fetus with Down syndrome to not be aborted.
Kids with Down syndrome have all the variances we see amongst ourselves:  platinum blonde to black hair, pale to dark skin, skinny to obese, muscular to scrawny, every ethnicity.  An Asian child with Down syndrome looks quite different than an African American.  Even Japanese and Chinese children with Down syndrome look different though this is very subtle to most Americans.<br />
Some individuals do not look very much like the typical at all. See this <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/metro.co.uk/2019/01/10/model-with-downs-syndrome-becomes-brand-ambassador-for-benefit-cosmetics-8330233/amp/" target="_blank">model</a> .   There was a time that cosmetic surgery was done to make a person look much less «Downsy». </p>
<p>TLDR-  there are many similarities but a host of differences!</p>

Not everyone affected will necessarily have all of the symptoms/traits as there is a spectrum. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
