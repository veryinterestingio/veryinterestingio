		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Archeologists and dentists have studied ancient skulls and discovered that while tooth decay did occur it was much rarer in the past.</p>
<p>The rise of severe and chronic tooth decay is traced to the 16th century when we added refined sugar to our diet.</p>
<p>Sugary foods feed the bacteria in our mouths which produce acid which in turn destroys our teeth. And these days sugar is in everything... cola, fast food, processed food, snacks, heck Subway bread legally can't be called bread in Ireland because it has too much sugar in it.</p>
<p>If we didn't eat sugar our whole lives our teeth would last a lot longer even with brushing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thousands of years ago:</p>
<ol>
<li>Acidic foods (and drinks!!) were not eaten every day by most people (or at all)</li>
<li>Refined sugar was not eaten in huge quantities every day by most people (or at all)</li>
<li>The diet contained much more rough fiber (plants, raw veggies, seeds) so there was a lot of scrubbing action even without brushing. Wild animals don't brush their teeth and are largely fine for this reason. Pets benefit from a rope toy they can sink their teeth into to replace this natural scrubbing from their &quot;normal&quot;/wild diet.</li>
<li>&quot;thousands of years ago when brushing teeth wasn’t a thing&quot; Dude the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_brushing" target="_blank">Egyptians were brushing their teeth with chewed twigs</a> literally 5,000 years ago. Ancient Greeks, Romans, Arabs and Indians cleaned their teeth with twigs too.</li>
<li>To answer the 1st part, they weren't &quot;meant to&quot; but yes, tooth problems were still a thing. Here's a description of a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0044904" target="_blank">dental filling done with beeswax</a> 6,500 years ago. Here's a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/07/20/scientists-discover-14000-year-old-evidence-of-dental-work-and-it-sounds-miserable/" target="_blank">record find of a cavity being painfully dug out using stone tools 14,000 years ago</a>. Anthropologists actually use the oldest-found cavities to determine when a society invented agriculture, because of the link to eating carbs, which are otherwise very scarce in nature.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not really.  Our teeth lasted longer because we didn't eat refined sugar.  We ate natural foods not processed foods.  So our teeth lasted longer.  Similar to how wild animals have teeth that usually last a while.</p>
<p>However, even thousands of years ago, there were teeth problems.  There is evidence we have uncovered of dental work being done on people even in ancient times.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Early humans ate a diet that was low in sugar and, obviously, devoid of processed sugars so tooth decay wasn’t as much of an issue. When your sugars come primarily from berries and fibrous fruit, it isn’t as damaging to eat every day as soda or cake.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your genes don’t ‘care’ if you live past procreation. Teeth never evolved to last your entire lifetime, because if they rot in mid/old age they don’t inhibit the propagation of your genes. The same is true for all age related illnesses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
