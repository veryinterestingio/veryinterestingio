So, imagining something like a terrarium bottle or something along those lines that you leave in the sun, how big would it have to be/how long would it have to be there to develop a micro-climate?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You really need to have a definition of micro-climate, which doesn't really have a standard one. For example the ability for it to rain can be done in an incredibly small container. Take a clear plastic to-go container from your favorite restaurant and poor some hot water in it and close the lid. Then put a bag of ice on top of it and you can see it rain. </p>
<p>Do you want the ability to have currents based on differences in temperature? You can do this with a large pot on your stove, fill it with water and just put a corner of it over a flame.</p>
<p>Maybe you think that using an outside heating or cooling device is cheating, well you could do all this with just the sun (another outside heating device) and some cloud cover (another outside cooling device) however it's really slow.</p>
<p>There's no definition and really it's just marketing for how big something could be. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think &quot;has its own weather&quot; means anything.  Any enclosure which is actually enclosed is going to have its own weather.  Who else's weather would it have?  A terrarium in the sun is almost certainly going to be hotter than its surroundings.  And probably either wetter or drier, too, depending on what you put into it.  What more is needed than that?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The Boeing everett factory, which is the largest building in the world by volume, had actual clouds and rain on the inside when it was first built before they installed an advanced air circulation system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
