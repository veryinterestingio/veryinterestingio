		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>> First of all, what do scientists mean when they say random?</p>
<p>In this context we mean completely unpredictable.</p>
<p>> I have heard that scientists can at least determine probabilities (of the location of a particle I think), if you can determine the likelihood of something doesn't that imply that something is influencing the outcome (not random)?</p>
<p>Not everything is equally random in any context in quantum mechanics. This has to do with the Heisenberg uncertainty relation that you might have heard about. It says that a particle cannot have a precisely known position and momentum at the same time. The more the position of the particle is determined the more undetermined is its momentum. So as you this doesn't tell you that you cannot have a particle with absolutely predictable position and indeed we can produce a very localized particle that has a well determined position, but it does tell us that such a particle will have a completely undetermined momentum.</p>
<p>So quantum mechanics doesn't tell us that everything is random, but says that not all degrees of freedom can be determined at the same time. You can put the randomness in whichever degree of freedom you want, but you have to put it somewhere.</p>
<p>> Could there be something causing these events and determining their outcome?</p>
<p>No, there cannot. They way to show this is using so-called Bell inequalities. By studying those, you can show that anyone who could predict quantum randomness, could use it that to communicate faster than the speed of light. Special relativity tells us that that screws with the concept of causality, so it basically tells us that quantum randomness is fundamental. The cool thing is that Bell inequalities do not depend on quantum mechanics, but only looks at the correlations of certain experiments and from that alone can make the statement that whoever could predict them, could do faster than light communications.</p>
<p>So even if quantum mechanics is wrong, we do know that certain experiments that we have made, are fundamentally unpredictable.</p>
<p>> If these events are truly random, how do random events at the quantum level translate into what appears to be a deterministic universe?</p>
<p>If you repeat a probabilistic process a lot of times, then the mean still approaches a deterministic value. Each microscopic process might be unpredictable but their collective effect still might be predictable. You can visualize it with a the <a href="http://static.dudeiwantthat.com//img/gear/gadgets/galton-board-34880.jpg" target="_blank">Galton board</a>. While it is super hard to predict how each individual ball falls, it is easy to predict the final pattern that the balls make up, because it will be always more or less the same.</p>
<p>If you average over a lot of indeterministic micro-processes, than you still get a deterministic process macro-process. Each deterministic macro-process in our world is made from a lot of  small quantum processes, each of which is indeterministic.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>> Science essentially assumes a deterministic universe, that reality has laws that can be understood,</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics has laws that can be understood. It doesn't allow for a perfectly certain prediction of every outcome of very measurement, but that doesn't mean it doesn't make predictions.</p>
<p>>and this assumption has held up pretty well.</p>
<p>A few years ago we have done a very sophisticated test on whether there could be some local-deterministic theory that describes our world. This test is known as the loop-hole free Bell test. It came back with the result that there cannot be such a simple theory, even if quantum mechanics was wrong. So the assumption of determinism did not hold up well. It is not compatible with our experimental observations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>(caveat much of this is &quot;subject to interpretation&quot; and there's a jungle of interpretations.)</p>
<p>They don't mean &quot;it could be predicted but we don't have enough information.</p>
<p>First random doesn't mean all outcomes are equally likely. You can have random outcomes distributed according to a probability distribution which can give certain outcomes higher or lower probability. Even though this is rather obvious I'm saying that explicitly because it's a common misconception that random means you can't make any specific statements about the outcome.</p>
<p>They mean the actual outcome at measurement can't be predicted, but the probability distribution according to which the outcome is random can be exactly predicted. A single die isn't a good example because all outcomes are equally likely, but imagine the sum of two dice, you have a distribution which says 7 is the most likely outcome, 6 and 8 are the next less likely, etc. 2 and 12 are the least likely.</p>
<p>In quantum mechanics what is deterministic is the evolution of the wave function and the wave function gives the probability distribution. But If you make a measurement a value is randomly picked according to the probability given through the wave function.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I don't follow.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Unless you are willing to drop <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_locality" target="_blank">one of the pillars of physics (locality)</a> (*), there can be no hidden variables (hidden information that we just don't know about, accounting for the randomness). This was experimentally tested.</p>
<p>* ie in a quest to make the theory more &quot;agreeable&quot; (by some subjective standard), you'd end up with something that is probably even less pleasing.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Does it appear that? I don't think so.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Physics just says given some initial situation we want to predict what can be predicted about the future.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is going to be confusing, because you're going to get different, potentially conflicting, answers to this question because (1) most physicists haven't spent that much time thinking about this beyond what they were told in their quantum mechanics classes (although some have spent lots of time) and (2) there isn't a definite answer to the question that all the experts agree upon.</p>
<p>The reason that there isn't an answer to the question is that physics primarily concerns itself with mathematical models of the universe that make testable, accurate predictions. BUT, there is not a unique way of looking at a mathematical model and drawing conclusions about what the fundamental nature of the universe is. In the process, you always have to make some choices, typically called interpretations in this context.</p>
<p>So, despite some differences there are some things relevant to your question that you can get almost every physicist to agree to. First, that there is a wavefunction which describes the status of the universe. And second, that typically the wavefunction changes in a <em>predictable</em> and <em>well-defined</em> way. This is, if I know the wavefunction to start with, then wait 5 minutes without doing anything, I will know exactly what the wavefunction is at the end. </p>
<p>What's the problem, then? Why doesn't this make Quantum Mechanics a deterministic, non-random theory? Unfortunately, knowing exactly what the wavefunction is, everything that there is to know about it, doesn't let you predict what numbers a scientist will see on a screen when a measurement is done. So now you have to make some choices.</p>
<p><strong>Choice 1, The Standard Theory</strong>: There is nothing beyond the wavefunction, and the universe behaves in a fundamentally random way. This is the choice most notably made by Bohr, and it persists as the most common explanation, which /u/Cera1th summarized.</p>
<p><strong>Choice 2, The Many Worlds Interpretation</strong> (and cousins): There is nothing but the wavefunction and it always changes deterministically. If you make this choice, you're committed to the idea that when you do an experiment <strong>all</strong> of the outcomes happen. There is no fundamental randomness in the universe, since how things change is completely deterministic. BUT, the outcomes of experiments are still unpredictable because when you do an experiment you don't see <em>every</em> outcome, you just see one. The process of only seeing one outcome (even though they all happen) is supposed to be described by a phenomenon called <em>decoherence</em>. This choice makes it clear why things can get confusing, because here you've eliminated all the randomness from the fundamental laws of the universe, and yet still experimental outcomes are fundamentally unpredictable.</p>
<p><strong>Choice 3, Non-local hidden variables</strong>: There is some 'extra stuff' in addition to the wavefunction that, in principle, makes everything deterministic, including what scientists see when they do experiments. The randomness that scientists see is a result of not having all of the information. There are several versions of this kind of theory, most notably Bohmian Mechanics. As already pointed out, the Bell Inequalities put constraints on what kind of 'extra stuff' you can put into the theory. If you put the wrong kind of stuff in, then your theory no longer makes accurate predictions. But, if you put the right stuff in then you get a theory which is 100% deterministic, and if you knew everything about the wavefunction and all of the extra stuff, then you could in principle predict everything with 100% accuracy. Of course in real life, no one knows everything about the universe, and there isn't any set of experiments you could do to learn everything about the universe. So, in practice, you're still left with probabilistic predictions.</p>
<p>One astounding thing is that regardless of which choice you make, you can get a theory which is consistent with the outcomes of all known experiments. As far as we can tell, there isn't any way to do an experiment to say that one choice is right and another is wrong (at least within the domain of applicability of the theory, namely non-relativistic quantum mechanics). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've got an example that may help.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I am a physicist who performs quantum experiments with Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs).  BECs are clouds of atoms that have been cooled to such a low temperature that they go from being particle-like to being much more wave-like. If you cool the atoms enough, they all eventually share the same quantum state and they can be all be treated theoretically as the same particle (I'm ignoring any mean-field/interaction effects in this description). Let's call the state shared by all the atoms state |0&gt;.</p>
<p>With my BEC I can run an experiment where I excite the BEC atoms into a different state, state |1&gt;. Two-state models for single atoms are well studied and can be found in undergraduate texts (e.g. Griffiths, see also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabi_cycle" target="_blank">Rabi Cycles</a>). Let's say I have just one atom and I excite the atom for some time t and then I measure which state it is in. For some values of t, I can tell you with 100% certainty the atom will be in |0&gt; or in |1&gt;, but for most values of t, I only know the probability that the atom is in state |0&gt; or |1&gt;. </p>
<p>Now assume I choose to excite the atom for a time t_50 where there is only a 50% chance the atom will end up in the excited state |1&gt;. In this case, you can say this experiment is very similar to a coin-flip. The result is random in the sense that before the experiment I can not tell you which state the atom will be in at the end of the experiment. A naive guess is as good as an experienced one.</p>
<p>Now, let's go back to the BEC. My BECs have \~100,000 atoms. Every time I run the two-state test on my BEC I can imagine it is the same as running 100,000 experiments simultaneously. Each atom acts as its own two-state experiment. When I excite the atoms for a time t and then measure their states, the number of atoms in each state will be predicted by the two-state model. In fact, I can reproduce the Rabi curve in the linked wiki article (above) by counting the fraction of atoms in the excited state for any given moment t. Despite this knowledge, there is no theory which allows me to predict the final state of particle #34,518. </p>
<p>This is like taking a 100,000 coin flips and then looking at the sum result. I can't tell you the result of any single coin flip -- that's random -- but the aggregate result is very predictable. There is a small amount of variation, as is expressed by the statistical uncertainty (standard deviation), but as the number of experiments becomes large, the statistical uncertainty (standard deviation) shrinks toward zero and the result becomes nearly-perfectly known.</p>
<p>As a result, I like to think of our macroscopic, deterministic, every-day experiences as the result of an uncountably immense number of quantum interactions. We are the result of so many random quantum interactions that the observable result might as well be deterministic. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>tl;dr</p>
<p>Do one quantum action -&gt; get a random result. Do a lot of random quantum actions -&gt; get predictable distributions. Determinism can arise from the random.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>P.S. I recommend taking a look at the history of quantum mechanics. Physics assumed determinism before 1900 and that assumption collapsed in the face of quantum mechanics. Determinism is no longer the default assumption in the field. Assuming the universe has laws that can be understood does not imply that those laws are deterministic. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others said: The fact that quantum mechanics isn't deterministic doesn't mean that it does not have laws that can be used to make predictions.</p>
<p>Classical mechanics is deterministic and if we know the initial state of an experiment completely we can calculate the exact one and only outcome. E.g. if we could carefully construct a test fixture to roll a dice such that we knew the exact location and speed of the throw we could calculate exactly the outcome of the roll.</p>
<p>In quantum mechanics there is no single outcome: (almost) every outcome is possible and occurs randomly. But the outcomes does not necessarily come with equal probability. The laws of quantum mechanics can be used to calculate the probabilities of each of the outcomes. E.g. if we can prepare the quantum dice in known initial state then we can calculate the probabilities for each of the six possible outcomes. While each roll of the quantum dice gives a random result, repeating the roll over and over again we'll see that some outcomes occur more often than others. The ratio of occurrences of each outcome to the total number of rolls will approach the precalculated quantum probabilities when we repeat the roll infinitely many times.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
