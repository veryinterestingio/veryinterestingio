<p>If every point is expanding from every other point, how can any quantifiable value of force be determined for it?</p>
<p>If it's actually antigravity -something like negative mass particles appearing with vacuum energy and annihilating or whatever- doesn't that break causality because negative mass allows stuff like building FTL drives?</p>
<p>Articles also say it's a force being exerted on the fabric of the universe itself, but is that quantifiable too?<br />
Is there a type of energy you can exert that actually does that?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dark Energy is something we observe the effects of but we don't have a good explanation for: hence the &quot;dark&quot; moniker. Specifically what we can observe (and measure rather precisely) is that the universe is expanding faster and faster. This is a rather baffling phenomena, and yes it does imply some sort of &quot;energy&quot; in a real sense. We can even measure just how much energy it would take to produce acceleration we've measured.</p>
<p>The current leading idea for where that energy comes from is that the empty vacuum of space itself emits a very low constant amount of energy. In the presence of any significant amount of matter (like a galaxy), this energy would be overpowered by gravity and not have a noticeable effect. However, in the empty space between galaxies, it would be enough to drive them apart. And the further apart they are, the more empty space, the more energy forcing them apart, the faster the expansion.</p>
<p>I think the negative mass theory you are referring to is the <a href="https://cosmosmagazine.com/space/could-negative-mass-unify-dark-matter-dark-energy" target="_blank">recent paper</a> that has been making the rounds theorizing that the effects of both Dark Energy and Dark Matter could be explained by negative mass spawning continuously in deep space. It is an interesting conjecture, but it is very far from accepted science. It introduces a number of problems, including yeah, negative mass allows for FTL and breaking causality and no end of other nonsense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The definition of force was made hundreds of years before we knew about dark energy, so it wasn't really set up with boundaries that include or exclude dark energy.</p>
<p>In the relativistic equations (Einstein field equations) that tell you how the scale of space changes over time (that is, whether your universe is expanding or contracting), there's a term involving the local pressure (the diagonal of the stress-energy tensor). Pressure is a force distributed across a surface.</p>
<p>Dark energy is another term in that equation that has the opposite effect of pressure. So it <em>acts like</em> a constant negative pressure across all space, which is <em>like</em> a force. Is it a force? Depends on what you mean by force.</p>
<p>Suppose you have an empty universe containing two massive galaxies. In a no-dark energy universe, they fall toward each other. But if you tune dark energy to the right amount, they appear to hover at the same distance apart forever. Dark energy is acting like a force.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you have plans to use dark energy as a useful technological force, you're pretty much out of luck. As far as we can tell, it's constant across all space and time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dark energy, as we understand it, is actually <em>positive</em> energy. Normally, positive energy exerts gravity that would slow the expansion of the universe. The reason dark energy doesn't is that it doesn't behave like normal energy (or matter, for that matter).</p>
<p>Normal energy (or matter) will dilute as the universe expands--the same amount of energy, but more space to fill. Dark energy, however, does not dilute. The simplest model for dark energy, the cosmological constant, is just a certain (small) amount of energy empty space has on its own per unit volume, even with no particles in it. So the density of dark energy stays the same, and the total amount increases as the universe expands.</p>
<p>Now, here's the weird part. All forms of matter and energy doesn't just have mass (via E=mc^(2)); they also exert pressure. Matter exerts gas pressure, and (light) energy exerts radiation pressure, which has a different formula. But something strange happens when you calculate the pressure of a substance that doesn't dilute as the universe expands, like dark energy: you find that it exerts <em>negative</em> pressure.</p>
<p>But pressure is <em>also</em> a form of energy. The units for pressure, newtons per square meter, are also the units for energy density, joules per cubic meter. And pressure actually counts 3 times as much regular mass-energy in its effect on the expansion of the universe, according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann_equations" target="_blank">Friedmann equations</a>. So the positive mass and negative pressure of dark energy add up to a net negative, which counteracts gravity and accelerates the expansion of the universe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
