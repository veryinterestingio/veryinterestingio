		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of these answers are just not adequate. Not claiming that I have the definite answer here but there are many factors to consider and maybe this will inspire some discussion to get closer to the answer.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I am terrible at ELI5, but I know some stuff about heat transfer...</p>
<p>First, let's look at the question. I'll assume that you with hot shower mean that the water is significantly above body temperature. And let's also make clear that there is a difference between submerging your body in water, and taking a shower. A lot of answers here assume submerging in water. I'll assume shower means shower. I'll also assume you mean a room where the walls and the air have close to the same temperature, like on a hot summer day with no air conditioning. I'll also assume the room is close to or warmer than body temperature.</p>
<p>In a room with comfortable temperature your body will lose heat in three main ways: sweating, radiation and convection. </p>
<p>Sweating is the most well known, where heat loss is due to liquid water turning into gas on your skin. In a shower you can still experience the same thing as long as you have good ventilation and the air is not already filled with steam. Even better, the areas of your body that are not directly under the stream of warm water will already be wet and this will speed up the process. In a warm room you can still sweat but it takes time for your body to adjust. If the air in the warm room is very moist, sweating does not help at all since no water can go from liquid to gas. This means your body WILL over heat eventually.</p>
<p>Sweating (evaporation) is however not how you lose most of the excess heat from your body. Most of the heat leaves your body simply because your skin is warmer than your general surroundings. To make it more ELI5, think about a fire. You feel the heat from a fire on your face even though you don't touch the flames. That heat is what we call radiation. In our example your body is the fire and your surrounding is the face (this can sum up to more than half of the heat you lose). In a hot room with warm air the walls will be warmer than your body so the opposite will be true. The surrounding heats you up! In a shower the walls will still be cold up until a point so you still lose heat through radiation (though much less than in a room with comfortable temperature). </p>
<p>The third main way of losing heat is through convection. Convection is just a fancy way of saying that the air moves around your body. The movement can be due to a fan, a draft, or just normal air movement in a room. In a shower steam will rise, causing a daft around your body. This can suck cool air in from the rest of your bathroom, cooling you down (while also improving our old friend evaporation). In a warm room movement of the air will instead heat you up! This is why you don't want to have a fan blowing on you on a hot and humid day.</p>
<p>One last thing that I'm sure helps but I don't know how much is heat loss from your lungs. In a shower you can pull down cool air from around the bathroom to take away some heat from your lungs (when you breathe out the air is warmer than when you breathe in). In a room with warm air you may lose less or no heat this way!</p>
<p>I'd say all these things work together to give you a nice, hot shower under the circumstances we assumed in the beginning of the post.</p>
<p>A shower will for sure heat you up eventually, especially if the steam starts heating up the bathroom. It just takes a bit longer then in an already warm room.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
