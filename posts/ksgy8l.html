		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difference is that light is additive, while paint is subtractive. Red light is red because it around 700 nm wavelength. Red paint is red because it absorbs everything <em>but</em> 700 nm wavelength. Thus, with light, the more you add together, the more you tend towards white (because white is all of the colors) while with paint, the more you add together, the closer you get to black because black is no color. </p>
<p>This is why with printing, instead of using RGB, they use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK_color_model" target="_blank">CMYK</a> (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Key- which is black). Because Cyan is everything but red, and Magenta is everything but green and Yellow is everything but blue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Mix them together and you get a dark mush that collectively is absorbing almost everything (BROWN).</p>
<p>Whereas the green light is shining JUST green.  And the red light is shining JUST red.  So when you mix them, they end up shining both at the same time, or what we call yellow.  And nothing is being absorbed at all.</p>
<p>It's far more to do with the fact that the light is just that... a light.  And the substance that you see because it reflects some light and absorbs other light, isn't a light... it's an object.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Paint: You start with white (paper) and remove everything except green. Then you remove everything except red. But green doesn't contain any red, so you end up with nothing, i.e. black. But paints aren't perfect so it's more like brown.</p>
<p>Light: You start out with black (the screen when it's off). You add green. You add red. Your eyes see both and you end up seeing their average, halfway between green and red, i.e. yellow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Paints are subtractive, light is additive.</p>
<p>Put differently, of the white light that hits a green surface, only the green is reflected and the rest is absorbed.  That's why red light on green leaves doesn't do anything. It's all absorbed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
