		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People are saying the Wuhan virus has an R0 of around 3.  I’ve heard R0 explained as the average number of people and infected person infects. Thus, it would seem that as long as this number is &gt;1,  the disease would just spread exponentially ad infinitum until the entire population had been infected or enough had grown immune/been quarantined that the R0 fell below 1. In the case of Wuhan, the entire world population should be infected at around 21 iterations if the number of cases tripled each iteration (3^21 ≈ 10bil).</p>
<p>However, given that basically every virus had R0 of &gt;1 and not all of humanity has had every virus, this doesn’t appear to be how it actually works. What am I missing here?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's another variable used called R(effective) which takes into account the number of people who can't catch the virus. For example, some people might have caught it before and are immune to it or may have been vaccinated. R(eff) = R0 • (the fraction of people susceptible). When nobody has immunity, for example when the virus is new, R(eff) ~= R0 but as immunity grows R(eff) gets lower and lower.</p>
<p>Some others mentioned it but basically R0 is the number of people that the infected person will <em>possibly infect.</em> Say R0 is 2. So if one person out of ten has the virus, they'll infect two. At the same time, that one person will have gotten over the sickness and won't be infectable. So, since 2/10 people are already infected and 1/10 is immune, that leaves seven people. Usually, those two people would each infect two of the remaining seven, but what if instead they &quot;infect&quot; each other or the immune person? Suddenly R0 doesn't work as well as a model.</p>
<p>Edit to add: now R(eff) works better:</p>
<p>R(eff) = R0 • the fraction of people susceptible</p>
<p>R(eff) = 2 • (7/10) = 1.4 so the virus isn't spreading quite as fast any more</p>
<p>When you scale that up to humanity, there's a high chance that not everyone will catch the virus. Add onto that countermeasures like manditory bed rest, quarantine, vaccines, etc. and the virus can't find enough hosts to continue to propagate :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple semi-complete answers here, but it's worth putting them together.</p>
<p>First, the same mathematical models we use to calculate R0 also tell us that not everyone in the population will get infected. It comes down to a missing piece of the your definition of R0--it represents the number of secondary infections from an initial case <em>in a totally naive population</em>. Like u/The_bestestusername points out, once you start accounting people who cannot get infected, especially the ever-increasing number of recovered individuals with newfound immunity, R-effective will tick downward toward 1 and the epidemic will burn itself out.</p>
<p>That's not really the explanation for why something like SARS (and hopefully nCoV-2019...) infects so few people though. That's more a testament to what u/arusol cites--the public health response to the infection. Some of these interventions could be captured in the model, and can be reflected in a lower R0 value. For example, quarantines decrease the contact rate between infected and susceptible individuals; wearing facemasks decreases the chances that contact between an infected and susceptible person would result in a new infection. Whether it's fair to call this a change in R0 is a philosophical question, since you're now in a world where the population is no longer naive in an immunological or cognitive sense.</p>
<p>There're two other points worth mentioning. First, R0 is an average. With SARS in particular, most cases led to no new additional cases, but a few led to dozens or even over 100 IIRC. Those kinds of epidemics are more likely to burn out randomly when they are first emerging (but can also explode way faster if you do roll that 20) than an epidemic where the variance in the number of new infections coming from existing infections is low. It may well be the case that for these epidemics resulting from an animal virus crossing into people, those are the dynamics you should expect. </p>
<p>Lastly, the models that we use to derive R0 make a LOT of simplifying assumptions. The key one worth mentioning here is that they assume a randomly mixing population (it's actually the same mass-action type of math as for molecules of gas interacting in a fixed volume). You can get away with this assumption when you apply the model to something like a city (maybe even one the size of Wuhan, but that's already stretching it), but when you start thinking about the whole world, you have to take into account that folks in North America don't have an equal chance of encountering an infected person as a citizen of Wuhan. This doesn't change the value of R0 itself, but it does change the way the epidemic plays out through time, in particular how quickly R-effective starts dropping to 1.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>RO is not an intrinsic property of the virus by itself.  It is a combination of the intrinsic properties of the virus and the LOCAL health situation  (e.g. are there quarantines in place, are the health officials competent  what is the population density, are people wearing masks , etc).</p>
<p>Thus the RO  can change  across regions (go from a country with a concentrated population to a country with a less dense population) or even change with time  (e.g. quarantines are now implemented whereas they weren't before).  All this eventhough the virus itself hasn't changed.</p>
<p>The R0 of 3 for the virus  is the value  at this paritcular time  in this particular place  (Wuhan province).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason diseases don't just exponentially explode and infects everyone is due to at least a couple of issues the disease will encounter. </p>
<p>The first and biggest factor it will encounter are measures to curtail its spread. An infection can start out strong but as time goes on and it becomes known, measures will be put in place that would prevent it from spreading as easily. </p>
<p>The other issue it will face is that it may naturally be less infectious the more it spreads. An infection is likely to break out in a population where it can thrive, while it slows down later when it reaches groups that are less vulnerable to it, such as populations with different genetic make-up, or who live in different environment, or who behave differently.</p>
<p>Because of these issues, R0 as a measure of infectiousness is most useful early on in a potential outbreak/epidemic, where it can help health professionals evaluate how serious a disease is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
