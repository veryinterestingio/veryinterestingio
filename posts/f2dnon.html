		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a study years ago where caterpillars were taught to avoid ethyl acetate by shocking them every time acetate was in the environment.   They let the caterpillars transform into adult moths, and then tested the moths again to see if they still remembered to stay away from the ethyl acetate smell.  It turned out that the moths still avoided acetate.</p>
<p>How is this even possible?  During the metamorphosis, the caterpillar essenntially turns into a liquid goop and the nervous system turns into gloop.  How does the goop get reconstructed into something as complex as a memory?</p></div></div>

<p>How does the goop get reconstructed into something as complex as a butterfly? </p>
<p>Well, it never really turns into &quot;goop&quot; in the first place. There's still plenty of structure within the chrysalis. It breaks down what it needs to to form the new butterfly parts, but it's hardly a matter of &quot;dissolve&quot; then &quot;reform&quot;. It's a very controlled process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of really simple animals 'learn' more by like, how receptors express on cells more than it being a thing they like, learn and think about in their brain and then remember.   </p>
<p>Like, instead of it being a memory encoded in their nervous system, it's just an expression of individual cells of &quot;hey, acetate is important, make more receptors, be more sensitive to it&quot; that you can destroy the whole structure of the nervous system but still keep.  </p>
<p>Like if you smoke it changes the number of nicotinic receptors in your brain. Even if someone chopped you up then brought a totally new thing to life using some of those nerve cells it'd still have the changed number of receptors and potentially still be addicted to cigarettes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer is that nobody knows.</p>
<p>Longer answer is that the connections in the &quot;brains&quot; must somehow survive the transition.  <a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/03/butterflies-rem/" target="_blank">Recent studies suggest that parts of the brain attached at the base of the antennae may not go through the same process as the rest of the animal and may therefore be able to preserve some types of memories.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just want to say that in a bit of a contrast to what /u/zeiandren said, insect brains are complex enough to have neurons interacting with one another, and those interactions (especially in parts of the brain called mushroom bodies) form memories.</p>
<p>How those memories (like aversion to certain smells) persist through metamorphosis is still a mystery. We have very impressive maps of neuron-neuron interactions in insects like Drosophila, so we are learning a lot. The latest I've seen on the subject was a paper from 2018 that says that interactions between those neurons may be altering the gene expression in the neurons, setting them up to continue remembering after they're put back together in the adult form.</p>
<p>Alternatively, there is also some evidence that not ALL neuron interactions get broken down during metamorphosis. It is a tricky and difficult thing to study, but people are working on it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
