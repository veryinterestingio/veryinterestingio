		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine your body's circulatory system as a road network, with a big city (your heart) at the center.  Now imagine the big highways that run out and connect to that city.  These are your arteries and veins, all relatively large.  Now, branching off of these you would expect a lot of small roads that connect each and every house in the surrounding areas to the main city, so everyone there can continue to live and work.  Your body does the same thing, with very small blood vessels called cappilaries, that crisscross ever which way throughout your skin and every other organ.  These connect every cell in your body together, ensuring they all have access to the oxygen and nutrients that your body provides.  Even though they're too small to see with the naked eye, these cappilaries are everywhere, and when you get even the tiniest cuts like you mentioned, these are why you bleed.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Put simply, blood does not exist outside of your. blood vessels. </p>
<p>Blood flows through the body as such: heart &gt; aorta &gt; arteries &gt; arterioles &gt; capillaries &gt; venules &gt; veins &gt; vena cava &gt; heart &gt; lungs &gt; heart. </p>
<p>When you get a small scrap or cut that oozes blood, you have disrupted a capillary. Capillaries are the smallest blood vessels in the body and are the point at which the tissues of the body exchange nutrients and waste with the blood. They are so small in diameter that red blood cells must pass through them in a single file line. This small diameter helps facilitate the movement of oxygen from red blood cells to the other cells of the body. These capillaries exists in abundance  within every tissue of the human body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it transports nutrients to all your cells. If it stayed in vessels, it wouldn't reach muscle and other cells to do its job. </p>
<p>Instead, it goes from large veins and arteries to a sort of middle man called capillaries, which are very tiny vessels. </p>
<p>They're so thin that individual blood cells and other substances in blood can flow through them to surrounding tissue/cells, to exchange butrients and oxygen and take away waste.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There isn't blood outside of the blood vessels (including veins). When you cut yourself you have damaged the blood vessels and it is able to leak out. The blood is mostly leaking from capillaries (unless the cut is bad) which are so tiny you can't actually see them. Whilst you can't see capillaries - when you blush or go red, you can see the effect of more blood being moved to the capillaries in your skin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are looking for a 5-year old answer, capillaries, which are the smallest blood vessels, transfer the blood that final step to/from tissues (cells). You have cells everywhere so it's possible to bleed, even from a shallow cut.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
