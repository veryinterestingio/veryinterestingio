<p>So what's the rate determining step here?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First you need to actually create the vaccine, and at that point biology (how long cells take to grow etc) is rate-limiting. Then once you have it, you need to test it via clinical trials to show that it's safe (Phase 1, healthy patients), and effective (Phase 2&amp;3, efficacy). Finally, once you have approval, you need to scale up production of the vaccine, which becomes rate-limiting.</p>
<p>From wiki: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vaccine production has several stages. First, the antigen itself is generated. Viruses are grown either on primary cells such as chicken eggs (e.g., for influenza) or on continuous cell lines such as cultured human cells (e.g., for hepatitis A).[80] Bacteria are grown in bioreactors (e.g., Haemophilus influenzae type b). Likewise, a recombinant protein derived from the viruses or bacteria can be generated in yeast, bacteria, or cell cultures. After the antigen is generated, it is isolated from the cells used to generate it. A virus may need to be inactivated, possibly with no further purification required. Recombinant proteins need many operations involving ultrafiltration and column chromatography. Finally, the vaccine is formulated by adding adjuvant, stabilizers, and preservatives as needed. The adjuvant enhances the immune response of the antigen, stabilizers increase the storage life, and preservatives allow the use of multidose vials.[81][82] Combination vaccines are harder to develop and produce, because of potential incompatibilities and interactions among the antigens and other ingredients involved.[83]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also related, of what use is making public the genome sequence of these viruses?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scientists can use this information in many ways: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is impossible to design a diagnostic test for this virus if you don't know what it is, and what is unique to this virus vs. in common with other viruses. As soon as the gnome went public, the CDC and others were able to design primers that will specifically amplify nCoV but not other viruses, forming the basis for the diagnostic tests being produced today</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sequence can be used to develop therapeutics. It tells us how the virus works, any potential weak spots, similarity to other viruses (that we know how to target), etc. Having the DNA sequence also gives us critical information about the proteins the virus relies on for virulence. </p>
</li>
<li>There's not just one genome, as the virus mutates. By sequencing many samples and comparing changes, we can infer how the virus was spread. See <a href="http://nextstrain.org/ncov" target="_blank">http://nextstrain.org/ncov</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>And why can't it be used in biological warfare?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It could be. The virus is all over the place right now, so wouldn't be hard to just grab and isolate it. But you seem to be asking about synthesizing it from the genome file online, which you could do, but most people aren't set up for it. And if you try to order the sequences to synthesize it, there is surveillance on that, so you'll probably get a visit.</p>
<p>A country could weaponize a virus in secret, which has fueled many conspiracy theories surrounding China and 2019-nCoV and the Wuhan Institute of Virology</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just answering your last question, as there have been enough good answers to the others.</p>
<p>If a virus is engineered and used for biological warfare against one country, it’s just as likely to affect the people living in the country that produced the virus. Viruses are not very interesting as biological weapons, because they don’t recognize or respect country borders and will turn on the country using it if given the opportunity. Or if it us controllable enough to prevent the virus from spreading in your own country’s population, the enemy country will be able to control the spread as well, making the virus unsuitable as a biological weapon.</p>
<p>A virus could maybe be interesting from a terrorist’s point of view, in case they don’t really care who’s affected as long as it creates enough casualties (so not for terrorists who would want to protect people from their group or country). However, the few virus samples that are that dangerous are very well guarded and only a limited number of people have access to them, so the possibility of terrorists getting to them (let alone use them) is very low. Furthermore, virus samples like that tend to expire (rendering the viruses inside them harmless) if they’re not stored under very specific conditions, which is a further hurdle that would prevent people from using them as a biological weapon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, there are many complicated steps to take:</p>
<p>First, creating that &quot;mild version&quot; isn't as trivial as you think it is. A virus is like a gift box: You have a gift wrapping and a present inside. What you need to do now is changing the present inside without changing the wrapping - or else your body cannot recognize it with a different wrapping. Even if you manage to do that step, how do you change the present inside? Creating a milder version of the present inside can still be deadly to people. Would you like to have such a &quot;vaccine&quot;? Anti-vaxers would go crazy. So every time you change somethign to these 2 factors you need to test again and again and again with many people to make sure it is both save to use and still working. Even if you manage to get that stable, you still have to get approval by the health ministry and must be able to produce it in numbers.</p>
<p>All this takes a lot of time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>More on the aspect of bio-warfare, Corona viruses make little sense for warfare as there is strategically little way for them to be utilized. Bio-warfare weapons are mostly researched for use as area denial agents (see anthrax). Transmissible viruses make little sense to deploy when your own troops or civilian population may get the disease.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
