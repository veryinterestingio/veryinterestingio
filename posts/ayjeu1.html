		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An ohmic conductor is simply one that follows Ohm's law: <code>V=IR</code>. Any conductor that does not is non-ohmic.</p>
<p>Tungsten only allows a certain amount of current to pass, even if you increase the voltage significantly, and therefore is non-ohmic. This is mostly due to the proportional temperature increase when current passes through it. The increase in temperature causes an increase in resistance, and therefore it cannot satisfy Ohm's law.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would not say that &quot;copper is ohmic while tungsten is non-ohmic&quot;. Either metal (and any metal) has an increase in resistance when warmed. Tungsten is special in that you can heat it to a higher temperature without melting.</p>
<p>But increases in resistance upon warming is not what we normally refer to as non-ohmic behavior. </p>
<p>A non-ohmic device is something that exhibits non-linear behavior without requiring an accompanying temperature rise. Examples: a semiconductor diode, an oxidized joint.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nothing is a truly ohmic conductor. But if you keep the temperature under control, most things are pretty close. Gold an silver would melt before they got too hot - as would copper. Tungsten is an exception because, at least in an oxygen-free environment, it gets very hot without melting (or burning), </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electrons moving through the overlapping valence and conduction bands in a metal tend to be described well by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_electron_model" target="_blank">free electron model</a>, which has the founding assumptions that there are very few interactions going on between the electrons and everything else, much analogous to the a perfect gas. As such, there is very little to make the process anything other than tediously linear in most respects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of Resistance as a function of current. Now expand it out as a taylor series.</p>
<p>R(I) = R(0) + R'(I)I + 1/2 R''(I)I^(2) + ...</p>
<p>The ohmic region is where R'(I) and all subsequent derivatives are small, and negligible. So Resistance is constant, and V=IR holds regardless of I. </p>
<p>When I is large, R'(I) might still be small, but the total product R'(I) and I might no longer be negligible, and Resistance may increase with current. This is where it begins to be non ohmic. </p>
<p>Diodes are most obvious example of non ohmic conductors. for V&lt;Vd,~0.6V, no current passes. V&gt;Vd, current traces out an exponential. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
