		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As some others have explained you may be more tired when you unintentionally sleep then when you actually sleep. Another interesting fact though is that if you do your work on your bed a lot your brain begins to start getting used to your bed as a work station rather than a resting place. Thus when you try to sleep your brain will be confused about why you’re sleeping at your workspace.</p>
<p>However, it’s still mostly about how tired you are. If you’re really tired you can sleep anywhere, anytime. If you’re not tired it will take some effort to fall asleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sleep is dependent on loads of things. </p>
<p>Firstly: melatonin. This hormone is released when your brain detects darkness. It washes in and starts off a chain of events that make you sleepy, but it’s inhibited by <em>any</em> light - phone screens, tv, house lights, night lights. It also tends to be a one-and-done, so if you miss the big rush you don’t get another one later by turning off the lights. It often sets in around sunset, which is when you’re settling down on the couch.</p>
<p>Secondly: routine. Believe it or not, the best way to get better sleep is to wake up at the same time every day, not go to bed. That way your body is always wearing at out roughly the same time. It’s a bit tricky to get used to, but if you start waking up at the same time every day and getting out of bed, you’ll eventually get tired more regularly. Routine also applies to your pre-bed habits. Have a set of activities you do before bed in the same order - eat, bath, dress, lie in dark room. Don’t use your bed for other things like study or video games; that breaks the routine and the conditioning stops working.</p>
<p>Thirdly: stimulation. This comes in all varieties but any stressful or exciting activity sets you back. It can even be things you enjoy, such as video games or books, or things you don’t, like thinking about work or study or deadlines or bills. Remember, the primitive part of your brain isn’t smart enough to differentiate between sources of stress; it only knows that it shouldn’t sleep while something exciting is happening in case that excitement is because of a tiger. Unfortunately today there’s a lot more options for stimulation out there, so it’s easy to set this one off. For the love of god, cut your caffeine intake. The number of people who can’t sleep and are having 6 red bulls a day. Yeah, you might have needed them because you were tired, but now they’re what’s keeping you awake.</p>
<p>Finally: comfort. This technically falls under “stress” but it’s often overlooked. When you’re lying in bed, are you in a neutral position? If any of your muscles are stretched or exerting, you’re less likely to fall asleep. Some people have their fists clenched, or a thigh rotated, and it’s just enough pressure that your brain doesn’t relax. Warmth is another one - you can’t sleep if you’re too hot or too cold - and so is fullness - eat smaller meals before bed because that bloating feeling will keep you up.</p>
<p>So I dunno mate, probably some combination of those things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because on the couch your brain is distracted. In bed it has all its attention on pondering the universe.
Side question. why can I sleep on a couch or a bed no problem but my brain refuses to fall asleep in a hammock? I have legit spent 8+ hours over night trying to fall asleep on a hammock and it just would not happen. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

When your in bed, you've set yourself a task, to fall asleep. If you have trouble sleeping then you can get nervous even during the ritual of getting ready for bed. All you need to fall asleep is to be sufficiently tired, safe and comfortable. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
