The contrast between distances (eyes to where we're in contact with a surface under us vs. eyes to way down where we could fall) can throw off our coordination and make us move a bit more clumsily. That's one of the reasons &quot;<em>don't look down</em>&quot; is commonly said (look forward instead).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Your brain gets extremely confused as it has to process all the ground, try to level out, and sees missing areas in close vicinity to your legs, which have to move in a very coordinated fashion in a level manner to work safely and effectively</p>
<p>Then that gets shipped to other parts of your brain that maintain balance and the cerebellum does the best it can with the garbage data your occipital lobe is working with</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain uses your eyes to help you not fall down. If you lean too far to the front or the back or the side, you fall down. Your brain measures how far away things are using a triangle. It uses the triangle to know how far you are leaning toward the ground. One side of the triangle is the line between one eye and the other. The other sides of the triangle are lines from each eye to the thing you are looking at. Look at a place on the ground and imagine the triangle between your eyes and that place on the ground. Lean forward like you are going to fall. Imagine the long lines of the triangle getting shorter. When they get shorter, your eyes have to point more in. Your brain measures this, and it knows that your eyes are closer to the place you are looking at. It can tell that the distance has changed.  It knows that you are closer to the ground and farther forward. But if you look at something really, really far away. The long lines of the triangle are really really really long. Your eyes aren´t looking forward and in, they are basically just looking forward, and the difference between something that is kind of really far away and something that is really really far away is too small for your brain to measure. It still feels like you are just looking forward the whole time. You can see this in the mirror. Go to the mirror with a friend. Have a friend hold his finger out in front of him and look hard at it. Then have him move his finger closer and closer until it is touching his nose, looking really hard at just his finger the whole time. Watch his eyes in the mirror look more and more in as his finger gets closer. Imagine the triangle his brain is using to measure how far away his finger is from his eyes change as he is moving it. Now, have him stand as far away from the mirror as he can. You stand near the mirror. Have him watch you move your finger as close to the mirror as you can and as far as you can, without taking a step. Watch his eyes in the mirror. You will see they don´t have to look in at all to watch your finger. Since his eyes don´t go in, his brain can´t measure how far your finger is from his face as well. If you tried this standing really far away, his brain would only be able to measure that your finger was really far away. It wouldn´t know if it was 1000 feet away or 1010 feet away. That´s why, when the ground is 1000 feet away, your brain can´t use it to know where your head is or if you are leaning too far over and will fall. You have to use your balance instead, or look at something closer to you. That´s why you should practice balancing with your eyes closed every day, so that your brain can learn to use your balance when your eyes are not helpful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Balance is mediated by several systems in our body. We have sensors in our joints that tell our brain where our limbs are relative to the body. The vestibule in our inner ear also tells our brain where your head is. And finally visual input helps your brain complete the picture of where everything is in space, helping you keep balance. A simple way to prove this is to try and maintain your balance on one foot and then close your eyes. You'll find it is much more difficult. By being high off the ground your visual input conflicts with the sensory input from your feet making you lose your balance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
