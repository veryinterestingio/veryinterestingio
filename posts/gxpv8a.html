		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll answer this from the observational record (i.e. there could be a different answer based on theory as reflected in simulations of the Earth's magnetic field, which I'm not as familiar with). From the remnant magnetic field preserved in rocks, we can say that intensity decreases during a reversal, but does not go to zero (e.g. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/20420.pdf" target="_blank">Guyodo &amp; Valet, 1999</a> or <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03674" target="_blank">Valet et al, 2005</a>). For a deeper dive (though a little old), <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.ea.20.050192.001145" target="_blank">Bogue &amp; Merrill, 1992</a> provide a very thorough review and highlight that overall field intensity decreases, but in detail most of this is likely driven by a decrease in the dipole component of the field (i.e. the part of the magnetic field that has two, clear, nearly antipodal opposite magnetic poles) where as the non-dipole component of the field doesn't seem to reduce in intensity as much or at all (see the 'Intensity of the Transitional Field' section on pg. 200). </p>
<p>While not directly asked in your question, the underlying driving thought is likely, <em>&quot;Are we heading into a reversal?&quot;</em> which is kind of always a popular question on AskScience, but there has been a noticeable uptick in these flavored questions over the last few weeks. With this in mind, it's worth pointing out that this is not a new question and the answer, <em>&quot;Probably not&quot;</em>, hasn't changed. E.g. this paper from <a href="https://websites.pmc.ucsc.edu/~rcoe/eart206/Cox_GeomagRev_Science69.pdf" target="_blank">Cox, 1969</a> with the simple abstract &quot;Although decreasing rapidly, the earth's magnetic field is probably not now reversing&quot; comes to the same conclusion as the USGS <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/are-we-about-have-a-magnetic-reversal?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products" target="_blank">today EDIT: fixed link</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, although these null points would be localized and temporary. The Earth's magnetic field is a combination of a large-scale dipole component (the largest contribution to the total field energy) and many additional higher order modes. Some of the high-order spectrum is induced by dynamics internal to the planet, and some are induced by external interactions with the solar wind. During a reversal or excusion, there will be fluctations in all components, along with considerable energy transfer between modes (like dipole, quadrupole, etc), from both the internal and external dynamics. Following the reversal, it seems impossible based on our understanding of planetary dynamos (and space weather) that the global MF would be zero everywhere at any moment in time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The magnetic field magnitude would never drop to zero, even during a reversal. Reversals are caused by perturbations in the fluid dynamics of the liquid metal in Earth's outer core. Which reduces Earth's steady-state dipole moment in favor of higher-order magnetic moments (quadrupoles, octopoles, etc). Because of conservation of energy, the liquid metal would continue to move and rotate, and would continue to induce a magnetic field. The magnetic field in the outer core will be the same magnitude, but depending on topology of the fluid movement, the topology of the magnetic field would be different, and the strength of the field could decrease faster with respect to radial distance than a dipole. During a reversal you would see &quot;false poles&quot; forming on the surface of the Earth at unconventional locations, such as the equator. In these areas the magnetic field direction will be almost entirely radial, and have no poloidal component. For this reason a compass would not work in these locations, but the magnetic field would always be present.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>That said, sometime in the distant future (The next billion years or so) Earth will lose its intrinsic magnetic field entirely. the main driver of fluid motion in Earth's outer core is convection generated from latent heat released from freezing of the molten metal onto the inner core. This dynamo action will continue until the outer core completely freezes. At that point Earth will have no intrinsic magnetic field. At that point the sun will erode most of the atmosphere until only a thin shell of carbon dioxide remains. Earth will then look more akin to Mars.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but what i mean is that if our decreas of the saa intensity is for example 10% per decade can like a day decrease 40% per decade out of nowere? And that case was presented in the past? </p>
