		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Card counting is one of the few legal methods to beat the house. So long as you are only doing the math in your head and not using a calculator, computer or anything to track the count.</p>
<p>Casinos by law can kick out anyone they want. If they suspect you of card counting they'll kick you out &quot;for not playing fair&quot;, basically they just don't want to lose the money.</p>
<p>With Poker on the other hand the house doesn't care as much because only 1 person at the table is leaving with the cash. The house makes money regardless of who wins.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
