		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your vocal cords produce sound by vibrating at a particular fundamental frequency, and then you modulate that sound with your jaws, lips, and tongue to create words and other noises. The frequency of the vibration of the vocal cords is itself also a function of the length of the vocal cords as well as the tension in the vocal cords and their thickness. Some of those factors are under your control and some of them are not, which is why while everyone (normal) can produce a range of sounds with their vocal cords, that range is not the same for everyone.</p>
<p>Just like a single string on a guitar can produce many notes because it vibrates in a different pattern to produce each note, your vocal cords can also vibrate in different patterns which allows you to span a wide range of tones with your voice. When your voice cracks, what's happening is you're having an uncontrolled transition from one of these modes of vibration to another mode of vibration. It's more common in adolescence, particularly male adolescence, because the physical properties of the vocal cords, namely their length and their thickness, are changing over time. Because of that, you don't know at any given instant what the exact correct tension to apply to the vocal cords is to produce the sound you intend to produce. So sometimes you get what you mean, and sometimes you get the equivalent sound but in a different register of your voice, a different pattern of vocal cord vibration.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you ever play a brass instrument, you'll learn that there are two ways to change the note you're playing. The principle works on any brass instrument, but it's easiest to see on a trombone. You can change the note either by making the air tube shorter/longer, or by buzzing your lips at a different frequency. On a trombone, or other slide instrument, you can move the note up or down and all points in between. But if you only modulate your lips, the notes will &quot;jump&quot; by large amounts. </p>
<p>This is because of a principle called &quot;harmonics&quot;. When you pluck a string, it has a characteristic frequency based on the length and tightness of that string. A musical tone from a string or horn will also produce &quot;overtones&quot;, which are based on the harmonics of the characteristic frequency. A harmonic is the frequency which is 2x, 3x, 4x etc. of the characteristic frequency. In a musical instrument, you only really hear the characteristic, and the overtones change the tone of the instrument but aren't normally heard as individual notes. However, in a brass instrument, by buzzing your lips at a higher frequency, you can jump from the fundamental tone to the second, third, fourth or even fifth harmonics. These are called the &quot;registers&quot; of an instrument. </p>
<p>The same thing happens with the human vocal cords. You can change the pitch of your vocal cords by modulating their shape and tightness. But your voice also has &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_register" target="_blank">registers</a>&quot;, just like a brass instrument. It's hard to control your vocal register manually, it just sort of changes automatically. </p>
<p>Now back to your main question. When you go through puberty, your vocal cords are growing. So when you try to make the sound you're used to, it will come out sounding lower. The muscle memory that used to all be in a single register suddenly is now in two registers, your &quot;chest voice&quot;, and your &quot;falsetto&quot;. So when you move from one register to the other one without expecting to, your voice cracks. </p>
<p>As for why grown men's voices don't crack? It's because their vocal cords stopped changing, and they're used to the way their body works. A man's voice can still crack if he makes it happen, but after enough practice, it rarely happens by accident.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ll speak mainly about the male voice because it has a more drastic change and more cracking (but make no mistake: girls have similar issues and transformation)</p>
<p>Also, it helps to know how the voice works: air goes quickly between the vocal folds (vocal cords) and through science magic (the Bernoulli Principle), get pulled a bit closer and vibrate. Your larynx (voicebox: Adam’s Apple in men) has muscles that tighten or loosen the folds to get higher and lower pitches. </p>
<p>Your vocal folds are stretches of elastic tissue. Males experience a drastic thickening and slight elongation of the folds and larynx. As your larynx learns to control these new materials, you will encounter times with improper lubrication, approximation (getting them close enough to each other), or generally being too swollen or strained and can’t vibrate correctly. </p>
<p>The only real fix is time. Until then, speak with a normal volume, avoid actions that cause pain to your voice, and sing (keeping the above warnings in mind). </p>
<p>Singing is the training of your voice and will strengthen the laryngeal muscles to allow easier phonation. Also, most girls like a guy who can sing. (If you can’t sing comfortably with pop radio, learn some country/blues, which is mostly lower pitched).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
