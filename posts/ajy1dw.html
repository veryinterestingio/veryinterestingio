		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you're driving on a highway. The &quot;3g&quot; part determines the speed limit. This highway used to be 20 lanes wide. It always had some level of traffic, so being able to actually drive at the speed limit was uncommon. There were also some sections that had a slightly higher speed limit (in marketing called 3.5g or HSPA+), but still the level of traffic usually determined how fast you could actually drive.</p>
<p>Now, they've built a new 4g highway. It has much faster speed limits, and they've built extra lanes. However to make room for some of those new lanes, they've also reduced the number of 3g lanes from 20, down to 2. So even though it has the same posted speed limits as before, the level of traffic still determines how fast you can actually drive. In fact traffic is usually worse than ever here, but since only a small number of people are using it, the people building the highways mostly ignore their complaints.</p>
<p>Now, work is starting to build new 5g highways. We expect the same thing to happen to the old 4g roads, and the 3g road will likely go from 2 lanes down to 1. It'll be there for a lot longer, in case you really need it, but it'll be clogged with traffic most of the time.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it's all about bandwidth. Bandwidth is determined by how fat a channel is allocated to the signal you're getting. In the 3G days, carriers might have thrown 15 or 20 MHz of spectrum to HSPA+ and achieved speeds up to 42.2 Mbps. Right now, most carriers allocate the majority of their spectrum to LTE because it a much more spectrally efficient (can handle more data connections) and slimmed their 3G channels to the bare minimum needed to service people who still rely on 3G for calls or data. Your 3G connection is probably running in a tiny 3 or 5 MHz channel that gets congested pretty easily. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>3G phones will barely have coverage now.  Really though, if you still have a 3G phone it is time to upgrade. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
