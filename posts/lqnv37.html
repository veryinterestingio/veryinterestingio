		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Based on info from one of the flu centers we work with having fewer people getting the flu means there's less data to understand the prevalence per strain and where they're appearing (since there are different vaccine formulations for different parts of the US). It adversely impacts our ability to design a vaccine formulation that's as effective as it might otherwise be. On one hand there are &quot;types&quot; of the virus against which we vaccinate that are effective against multiple strains that are always present in the vaccine. On the other hand we cannot vaccinate against all strains because the components of the formulation become mutually exclusive (thus we have to blend based on what we predict to be the hot-strains for a given year).</p>
<p>In a sense, it's a modification on the saying &quot;a shot in the dark.&quot; In this case the room's not pitch black, but it's definitely dimmer than it would otherwise be. Get your flu shot regardless! They have a cumulative effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Three things. 1) The BASE mutational change rate, a function of time, will remain the same. Oxygen and nucleic acid interect to alter the bases at a known evolutionary rate. Flu has a substitution rate as a base that is known. You could argue that it does not radically change, but change my mind, it's relatively small. However 2) The IN-HOST mutation rate will be reduced overall as a function of the population, resulting in potentially fewer veriations in the virus pool, because there are fewer overall pathogen-host interactions. This is something like 10e-6 changes per nucelotide site infection cycle. Then, fewer infectious churn, result in fewer change. This is good!! It is known that being in a host accelerates the change of a virus somewhat. If you look at Marc Tompkins work in ferrets, you sequence a virus, put it in the host, incubate, and then get back out virus from a nasopharygeal swab in a week, what you get out is a slightly different sequence than what went in. I do not know how much, and for which host and segment combos you want to measure, sorry. But this phenomenon is because a host immune system selects differently against mixtures of virues because people have different antibody repertoires. The virus survivors move along, the ones that were proteolyzed do not. This is also known. Last 3) the REASSORTMENT will be radically reduced. I mean, a lot. So, because there are fewer infections, the chance of having two different strains from a pig and a person, or an avian passerine, or a dabbling duck, will be radically reduced. This goes down as a function of the two, or possbly the square. Two rare diseases do not usually mix. If you have fewer single infections, you have fewer double infections (different strains) required to mix segments of flu from one species to the next and thereby create a new reassortant like 2009 pandemic H1N1. Overall we are better off for having fewer flu infections, because it takes some of the novel variability off the table. We fight the newnes and variability with new vaccines each year. Fewer variations are out there because the disease transmission is less hot. We are better off for masks. There is a benefit to wearing them for corona.

<p>Is it a flu variant that literally stays throughout the year, or does it just appear in an unlucky individual who's a bit down on their immune system?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
