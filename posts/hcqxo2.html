		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Does it have something to do with the maximum amount of water the air molocules can hold without being water? Similar to the limit of salt in water?</p>
<p>Edit: Thank you so much for all the replies and good analogies, what I get from this is 1) I was close to correct when I mentioned salt in water 2) This subject is plenty more complex than I first thought 3) Air Conditioners were originally meant to control humidity 4) The main factors of RELATIVE HUMIDITY are temperature and air pressure </p>
<p>If there is anything more in depth you want to elaborate on , I am very interested in this subject now so thanks :|</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>100% humidity is when the air cannot absorb any more water at that temperature and there is the possibility of rain. How much water is actually in the air depends on the temperature tho, which is why if it's humid in the evening there will be dew in the morning. If a warm, humid from meets a cold front, there will be rain, and the warm front will become less humid. It's less like salt in water, and more like sugar in water, because the sugar doesn't actually get bonded to the water, it's just carried by the water</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Humidity is just a percentage of how full it is. If it is 100% you cant put any more moisture in the suitcase.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some days when it is quite warm outside, we are kept cool because we sweat and our drying sweat keeps us cool.   The humidity is lower.   </p>
<p>Some days when it is warm like that, though, we get warm and dripping with sweat and our sweat doesn't let us cool down and doesn't dry.   The humidity is higher.  </p>
<p>When the humidity is 100%, it means that the air is very moist and cannot take up more water.  Things will not dry in such air.</p>
<p>Weather scientists measure humidity using water and two thermometers -- one wetted and one dry.     Usually, a wetted thermometer will be cooler.   But if the wetted thermometer is 100% the temperature of the dry thermometer at the end of the test, then the relative humidity is 100%.   </p>
<p>This measures the air's ability to accept more moisture, a function both of the air's dryness and temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humidity in this context refers to relative humidity. At this air pressure &amp; at this temperature, how much water is in the air and how much can it hold in total. Divide the former over the latter, *100 is the percentage. Any more water cannot evaporate.</p>
<p>Evaporated water is still just water, but in a different state.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually we mean it in terms of <em>relative humidity</em>. 0% means there's no water in the air. 50% means there's half the water vapor the air can carry <em>at that temperature and pressure</em>. 100% is fog where the water just starts to condense into drops.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
