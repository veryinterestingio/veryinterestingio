		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a critical skill for musicians to learn.  It’s called Audiation or Aural Image.</p>
<p>Most books call it ear training, but really it’s mind training.</p>
<p>In the same way you can visualize something in your mind, you can also hear something in your mind.</p>
<p>Think about the physical complexity of singing.  Matching a pitch means that the vocal folds need to stretch to become JUST the right length to vibrate at that frequency.  It’s not like when someone goes to sing, they’re consciously moving those vocal folds to just the right position and then finally make some sound.  </p>
<p>My expertise is in vocal anatomy and vocal health as a college professor for 5 years now and whether through memory or good audiation, hearing with your mind is not voo doo or something mystical, it is a real skill that can be honed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much - but it would be the minds &quot;ear&quot; rather than the minds eye - that is the memories work pretty much the same way but the memories of visual things are processed by the same part of your brain (kind of) that processes how you see things but memories of sounds are processed by the part of your brain (kind of) that processes how you hear things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Memories are not so much replaying video, like you would on a computer. In everyday life your sensory organs feed boatloads of raw information to your brain. Brain filters through the unimportant stuff and interprets the data as sight, hearing, taste... When you form a memory all you are doing is storing this sensory data together. And when you go to recall it you are just &quot;re-experiencing&quot; the sensory data. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_memory" target="_blank">*</a></p>
<p>However human memory is garbage. Things get corrupt, lost, and made up all the time. Every time you recall a memory, the very act of recalling it can alter it slightly, or swap details with another memory, etc. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confabulation" target="_blank">*</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since this has been answered already I will add something interesting. People with damage to the area that handles this, the minds mouth if you will, will also lose the ability to speak to themselves in their head.</p>
<p>Also, people with split brain, both halves of the Brain are separated from each other, experience a similar thing. The area we i was talking about only exists on your left hemisphere. People with split brain have two different minds, made clear by the fact that one hand can move with one intention but the other hand with another. However, the &quot;right personality&quot; don't have the ability to think in the form of words, while the left one does.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't &quot;see&quot; or &quot;hear&quot; the external world directly either.</p>
<p>Our brain is like a computer, it gets data from the eyes and the ears.</p>
<p>It takes that data and creates a world that you see and hear in your mind.</p>
<p>So the real world is already created in your mind using data that comes from your senses.</p>
<p>When you see and hear memories, it's the same thing... but it's using stored old stale data from your memories instead fresh detailed data from the outside world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
