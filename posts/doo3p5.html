		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's quite a few different tactics used to keep produce fresh during transportation and storage:</p>
<p>Temperature  - Just like your fridge at home, produce is kept cool (generally not  frozen as the formation of ice crystals damage plant structure). Lower  temperatures cause chemical reactions, and thus life itself to slow  down. Both the produce itself and any fungi or bacteria that can spoil  the produce are slowed down preventing the food going off.</p>
<p>Humidity  - Many living organisms are reliant on water to survive, and reducing  humidity either by refrigeration or direct removal of water from the  surrounding air inhibits fungal and bacterial growth.</p>
<p>Removal  of spoiling organisms - As discussed above,  fungi and bacteria spoil  produce. After picking the produce may be simply washed, sprayed with  biocides or exposed to gamma or UV radiation to reduce or destroy fungi  and bacteria on the produce.</p>
<p>Maintaining  a sterile environment - Again those major spoiling agents come into  play again. Once they have been removed, these organisms need to be  prevented from infesting the crop during transport. Sterile gases free  of oxygen can be pumped around the produce, inhibiting the growth of  aerobic spoiling organisms. Alternatively, biocides can be sprayed onto  the produce or even a simple wax coating (common for citrus and pome  fruits) inhibit the growth of spoiling organisms.</p>
<p>Picking  unripe produce - Produce is picked at a stage where it isn't ripe, but  is fully capable of becoming so by itself without any input from the  plant it was picked off. When the still unripe produce is approaching  its destination, plant hormones such as ethylene introduced to induce  ripening.</p>
<p>Crop genetics - The  genetics of the crops themselves affects how long they take to ripen and  how long they can last before becoming overripe. For example, crops  with the genes for reduced ripening hormone production were selected so  the produce ripens slowly, unless humans artificially introduce these  hormones when we want them to ripen.</p>
<p>These  improvements (in particular refrigeration) are highly effective and  have enabled the globalised food economy we see today. Often the apples  you eat in Spring and Summer are ones picked from the Autumn before,  stored in cooled sterile warehouses and induced into ripening in special  lorries on the way to the supermarket.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're kept cold.  Sometimes they are literally frozen for the travel to the destination and then unfrozen before they're packaged and sent to supermarkets.</p>
<p>They're often bagged or otherwise sealed.</p>
<p>They're swathed in nitrogen and other gases which means there's almost no oxygen to attack them (oxygenation is what destroys a lot of things on the planet, including food, steel, etc) and which either prevent ripening or, in some cases, induce ripening in things that were picked way before they were ready to be ripe.</p>
<p>And most food lasts way longer than 2-3 days anyway, you're only seeing the end-point after already it's been transported.  If you picked it fresh, it would likely last an extra couple of days anyway.</p>
<p>Stick an apple in a cold sealed tupperware box and it'll last days longer than if it's just sitting out somewhere - I've had apples last weeks and sometimes into months just by sitting on the bottom drawer of my fridge.  That's how people used to survive the winter, after all.  Apples will last a season and still have edible goodness (though you might want to mash, stew and preserve stuff to last you out for the end few weeks).  Any fruit or veg that has a sealed skin will do the same in the right conditions because the air can't get to it.  Pears stay &quot;unripe&quot; (hard) for weeks if you store them right.</p>
<p>Same with bread (if you get bread that crusts nicely and seals itself fully, like some Italian breads, they are basically air-tight inside and survive the hot weather and for much longer than the open, fluffy, crumbly breads that we are used to in modern supermarkets), cheese (lasts almost forever in the right conditions), carrots, potatoes, etc.</p>
<p>It's all about reduction of surface area, reduction of interaction with the oxygen in the air, and reduction of moulds and bacteria by keeping cool (though for some foods this is positively encouraged - e.g. cheeses, salamis and salted hams which crust over to form an air-tight hard outer shell which means the stuff inside stays good... salami and similar meats are often bought with a &quot;good&quot; mould all over the outside of it).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A small addition to all the other answers: another factor that makes fruit spoil at home is that you store different fruits together. Some fruits, such as apples, naturally release ethylene gas while ripening, which accelerates other fruits' ripening process a lot. It's better to store apples (and kiwis) separately from other fruits and vegetables for this reason.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
