I was quite sure that it would be the other way around knowing that hydrogen bombs for example are much stronger than uranium ones. Also scientists think if they can keep up a fusion power plant it would be (I thought) more effective than a fission plant. Can someone help me out?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Correct, Neutron-induced fission using uranium-235 releases about 200 MeV on average per reaction ad DT fusion releases on average 17 MeV per reaction.</p>
<p>The difference is density of fuel. If I have 1 gram of uranium fuel, and one gram of DT hydrogen fuel, the hydrogen fuel will have a higher amount of atoms in it (roughly 230x more). Because the DT fuel has a higher number of atoms, there will be more reactions per gram of fuel. And the more plentiful reaction count means that more overall energy will be produced per unit weight of fuel. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer is that per atom Uranium releases more energy, but those atoms are much larger which makes it less energy dense.</p>
<p>U-235 the usual fissile isotope used typically has an atomic mass of (you guessed it) 235. The&quot;heavy&quot; isotope of Hydrogen deuterium has an atomic mass of 2. </p>
<p>Uranium might release 7.8x more energy per atom, but for the same mass of Hydrogen 2 you have 117.5x more atoms. </p>
<p>Assuming 100% efficiency for both that means 1kg of hydrogen2 has 7.5x the energy of 1kg of Uranium. There's also the part where uranium is relatively rare while hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Based on u/RobusEtCeleritas's numbers:</p>
<p>Atomic weight of U-235 = 235</p>
<p>Fission energy released per unit mass = 200/235 = ~0.85</p>
<p>Atomic weight of D+T = 2 + 3 = 5</p>
<p>Fusion energy released per unit mass = 17/5 = 3.4</p>
<p>3.4/0.85 = 4</p>
<p>∴ 1 gram of DT releases ~4x as much energy as 1 gram of U-235</p>
<p>Obviously assuming that 100% of mass reacts</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While all of the energy density arguments are interesting, the only thing that really matters is cost. Hydrogen is much more plentiful than is uranium. Fusion is inherently safer, that is to say it's hard to maintain fusion reactions whereas it's hard to stop fission (relatively speaking). Fusion doesn't leave behind radioactive waste for 10,000 years. All of these things come together to make it likely cheaper for the long term, when and if it ever works commercially. It really doesn't matter which one is more powerful because there's no reason we couldn't just build a lot of them. For example wind and solar take many orders of magnitude more space per MW than anything else but we're building those quite aggressively. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can speak for the bombs. So-called “fusion” or “hydrogen” bombs are typically more powerful than “fission” bombs, but not because of the fusion explosion. The way H-bombs usually work, a small fission-bomb-like trigger initiates a fusion reaction which then generates the necessary heat and pressure to cause more complete fission of another fissionable mass in the bomb. The overwhelming portion of explosive energy comes from the more complete fission of this second mass within the bomb. The “fusion bomb” potion of te warhead is simply a method for more efficient fission. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
