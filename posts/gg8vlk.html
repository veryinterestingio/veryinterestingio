<p>You search for other things and a computer with alot of data figures out that the type of person who searches for these 5 things but not those 8 probably is interested in this new thing.</p>

<p>Americans for example, are exposed to up to 10,000 ads per day...

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have to add an answer here that most people don't think of. Of course data analysis and confirmation bias are part of it, but there is another piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p>When this happens ask yourself why are you talking about something that is related to the product being advertised in the first place? Is it possible you are having that conversation because of something you read about on social media? How many conversations do you tend to have that aren't fed in some way by your consumption of social media.</p>
<p>You didn't see the ad because you were talking about the thing. You were talking about the thing because social media told you to talk about the thing. Then they show you the ad after you are already primed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a combination of good ad-targeting based off the information about you that is available, along with confirmation bias.</p>
<p>There is a lot of information about most people available to advertisers. Even a <em>lack</em> of information is a hint to them (wouldn't be surprised to see more VPN ads for people using incognito mode). Based on this info, along with cross referencing the with others who have similar info, very good guesses can be made.</p>
<p>On top of this, we see ads all the time. You are likely to just filter out an ad that isn't relevant or interesting to you, but there's a much greater chance of you paying attention to and remembering it if you've just learned about the subject or had a conversation about it. We don't remember the thousands of times this coincidence <em>doesn't</em> happen.</p>
<p>Many people think their devices are always listening/recording/transmitting them. There are several reasons this isn't the case. Among these are the expense of doing so, battery requirements for mobile devices, data transmission/analysis/storage costs, legality, very knowledgeable people looking and testing for this practice, and the PR disaster that would result if discovered. I'm not saying any one of these things makes the practice impossible, but together they are a huge disincentive.</p>
<p>I've seen plenty of tests showing negative results, but I have yet to see any serious evidence of devices constantly listening (ignoring of course where the practice is explicitly stated, or fringe cases involving malware or hardware hacking).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
