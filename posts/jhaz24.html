<p>What about if learning something physical, does that mean the same changes happen in a different region of the brain like the cerebellum?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Until a &quot;light bulb moment&quot; occurring is captured in an MRI or similar scan at the moment of it's occurrence, and that is done many times with many different people to truly capture sufficient reliable and consistent data, nobody can give you a proper answer on what &quot;happens&quot; to / in the brain.</p>
<p>If anybody does give you an answer, while this observed data does not yet exist, know that it is speculation, even if given by the world's best neuroscientist.</p>
<p>That being said - the brain is known to process information not only consciously, but subconsciously as well. Namely, it is known to perform problem solving tasks in this manner. It's called Unconscious Cognition.</p>
<p>Sudden realization moments happen likely because your brain has been working on a problem for a while, while you were unaware of it, and has either reached a solution which you then become aware of, or you have acquired some additional information that it required in order to reach that solution.</p>
<p>Minor Addendum: <em>Your brain does a LOT that you are not aware of. Imagine being aware of every single aspect of every single sensory input being processed, being aware of all memory alterations or fading, being aware of all the cognitive functions involved in forming sentences or interpreting language spoken to you, being aware of all the cognitive functions involved in you reaching to grab a can of soda with your hand (the distance to reach, the amount of pressure to get a good grip, the amount of muscle tension to control the speed of your reach, even the recognition of all the visual patterns that make up the &quot;soda can&quot; object), etc. Your brain does a whole lot of work subconsciously, and a lot of problem solving already in most aspects of life. The same applies to cognitive efforts like solving mathematical problems, or other such endeavors.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

When we solve a problem and the answer sticks, the brain stops working as hard and rewards us for solving the problem so that we remember it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If we believe the analysis of Dedekind on intuition, it is impossible to replicate human intuition with finite logic, or logic using a specific number of truth values, such as true and false forming a binary truth value. Our intuituon can only be described by infinitary logic, or logic with infinitely many truth values. There is no known way of doing this, however. So, we can't know what exactly is happening at a neuronal level. </p>
<p>But, any euphoria you would feel at that moment is likely due to the release of endorphins, which cause euphoria and pain relief by activating opioid receptors. In a way, chasing new learnings is like chasing an opium high. The mechanism to make you pursue this goal would be regulated by dopamine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>_The various structures of your brain are essentially making a model of reality. You use this model to predict the future: that the sun will rise tomorrow, you will feel hungry soon, and if you step on that uneven ground, you will lose your balance and possibly die. The model gets more accurate over time: you notice things that were not obvious before. In my experience, an epiphany happens when some very large facets of the model suddenly reveal themselves to have connections I didn't perceive previously. I don't know why if feel so good, but one thing I do know is that the connection had to have been building without me seeing it, because the connection is <em>so</em> undeniable, and has so many branches to smaller parts of the model that support the truth of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans learn largely through association. This shows up in our brains as physical connections <em>between</em> neurons, not the generation of extra neurons. Learning is therefore the act of adding or strengthening the connections between neurons to build associations.</p>
<p>When I was in elementary school, I struggled with the concept of division. After some time it became obvious that I was going to fail math if I couldn't pick this up in time, so my parents got a tutor. She walked me through the process: setting up the problem, comparing the divisor to the digits of the dividend, subtracting, and carrying the results to the quotient. Individually, I could perform any of those tasks, or all of them in sequence if I was told the sequence to perform. Trouble was, I didn't understand- That is, didn't have any associations with- why I was performing this sequence. It was only after exhaustive repetition combined with real life scenarios in which I might need to use division that the connections were formed.</p>
<p>Looking back on it now, I'm pretty sure that the lightbulb moment for me was not the moment when some connection was drawn and I suddenly &quot;got&quot; division, but rather the connections were steadily being drawn up over the course of a week or so, and I quite suddenly realized that I could do the division without being told what to do or why.</p>
<p>This is essentially how machine learning works, too, and why machines without neural networks are incapable of learning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
