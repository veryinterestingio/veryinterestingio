		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Things like texture and aroma play a large part in what we consider the “taste” of food.</p>
<p>Heat changes the texture of many foods—
for example, take a fatty food like a cut of steak or a piece of fried chicken. when the food is hot, the fatty parts of the dish are moist and almost like liquid, so that they pleasantly “melt” in your mouth.  If you were to eat fatty steak or fried chicken cold, it would not be as good because the fat would just taste hard, cold and greasy (think of how a stick of butter feels in the fridge compared to room temperature).</p>
<p>Another thing that contributes to our experience of flavor is smell, so a bowl of soup would taste better hot because it’s giving off pleasant aromas with all the steam but if you ate the soup cold, you would not experience this sensation.</p>
<p>So those are just two reasons/examples.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Food bits dissolve and react more readily at a higher temp; also they can release more aromas into the air so your nose can aid in helping you taste. It's hard to taste some things when they are cold as they just kind of sit on your tongue and don't do much besides chill your tongue, which makes it even harder to taste.</p>
<p>It's kind of why ice cream can be hard to taste after you eat too much. Also the opposite--liquid ice cream is pretty strong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm on my phone so short explanation:</p>
<p>What gives food most of it's flavor are it's volatile compounds. This compounds have the property of having molecules that evaporate or sublimate at room temperature.</p>
<p>When you heat food, you are forcing more of this volatile compounds to evaporate, hence feeling more flavor.</p>
<p>This happens because most of the flavor we perceive is from our sense of smell, not the taste buds.</p>
<p><strong>This is the main reason, not food texture.</strong></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I heard somewhere that the heat of the food tells our brain that it's likely free of harmful bacteria or pathogens. Same with cold water. Stagnant, unsanitary water is usually luke-warm, so our brain says <em>no</em>.
I don't know if this is true.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
