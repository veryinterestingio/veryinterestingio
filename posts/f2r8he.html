		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Coffee begins to oxidize rapidly after grinding. The more air you allow to get to it the more oxidizing (change in flavor) occurs. When you grind it up and keep it in a big bag or container less of the coffee gets exposed to the air, basically just the bit on top. When you separate the coffee into a bunch of smaller portions you’re giving each bag of coffee more opportunity to oxidize. This only matters if you use the coffee relatively quickly after it’s been ground since even if packed relatively tightly it will still oxidize. </p>
<p>This hasn’t stopped people from producing single <del>Serb</del> serve options, there are several bag and single pour over solutions to choose from as well as the (in)famous Keurig, but these delivery systems are pretty universally viewed as producing inferior tasting coffee.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I live in Argentina and we have coffee in bags just like tea. The downside is they have to be wrapped individually in plastic to avoid oxidation or any other harmful interaction with air / moisture. Also, they aren't cheap, but not really crazy expensive either. I find the taste better than instant coffee, but worse than just brewing coffee using ground beans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am unsure of this premise. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-serve_coffee_container" target="_blank">Single-serve coffee containers</a> have been a thing for a while and I believe have become more popular over the last decade or so as several companies developed new containers and machines.</p>
<p>In any case, there is also a large culture around brewing coffee, with different methods and of course choice of beans depending on a persons tastes. This can not be achieved as easily with prefabricated containers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
