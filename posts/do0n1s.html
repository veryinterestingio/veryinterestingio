But one detail I am not clear on is why a low thermal output (200mw), in itself, would make an accident more likely. The book states that the thermal output of the reactor during the backup power test was meant to be between 700 and 1000mw, but one of the people supervising the test insisted that the reactor's thermal output be brought down to 200mw. The book speculates that this person insisted on the lower thermal output because he assumed it would be safer, and to my (layman's) mind, this seems to make sense. </p>
<p>As it happened, due to operator error, the thermal output of the reactor dropped to around 30mw, leading to xenon poisoning in the reactor. To bring the reactor back up to 200mw, virtually all of the control rods in the reactor were manually removed and numerous automatic failsafes were overridden. Supposing instead that the reactor was gradually brought down from its normal operating level to 200mw, could something still have gone wrong owing only to the low thermal output?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some background on RBMK reactors to preface my answer to your question. RBMK reactors are graphite moderated and water cooled. Water acts as both a moderator and absorber, however in RBMK's the graphite carries the bulk of the moderating potential so the water tends to act mostly as an absorber. This is important because losing water or decreasing the density will reduce the absorption of neutrons. In critical operation, neutron population is in equilibrium (rate of neutrons born = rate of neutrons absorbed/lost). If the density of water in the RBMK decreases, less neutrons are absorbed, and the population of neutrons will increase, essentially inserting reactivity in the reactor. This is called a positive void reactivity coefficient (reactivity increases as voids increase). </p>
<p>Intuition would tell you that at lower power levels, less boiling occurs so the density is also expected to remain near constant. Indeed the 'predicted channel coolant density response is small at low power levels.' and 'the channel void nearly collapses.' Unfortunately it is not so simple. In reality, 'the density response exhibits a maximum at an intermediate low power,' which is to say contrary to expectation, the decrease in density is greatest at low power (see Fig. 5-2). This occurs because the density of coolant is not dependent on power level alone, but rather dependent on power-to-flow ratio instead. A physical interpretation would be fast-moving water flow needs more heat to boil while slow moving flow requires much less (boiling water in a pot while constantly stirring vs. boiling still water). </p>
<p>The result is instability at low power. At low power operation, the density response function is near the maximum. Since RBMK have a positive void reactivity coefficient, voids created at low power insert reactivity. Since the time constant of this behavior is on the order of seconds, it is far too quick for operators to react since RBMK's take ~10-20 seconds to fully insert control rods to for SCRAM. </p>

<p>Addressing your second question 'Supposing instead that the reactor was gradually brought down from its normal operating level to 200mw, could something still have gone wrong owing only to the low thermal output?' That's actually exactly what they did (or intended to at least); the reactor was gradually brought down from its normal operating level to the low thermal power required for the test (which was 700-800 MW, not 200 MW). The problem arose from the electrical operators in Kiev demanding Chernobyl's operators postpone their test to satisfy electricity demands for that evening. They ended up operating at ~1600 MW for 12+ hours, much longer than planned, giving time for xenon to build up and poisoning the reactor. When time came for the test, the operators began lowering the reactor that had been sitting at 1600 MW for far longer than intended to 700-800 MW for the test, but due to the xenon buildup, operators could not stabilize the reactor at 700-800 MW and power quickly dropped to 30 MW. You have it backwards in your post; xenon poisoning led to 30 MW power output, not the other way around. To address this, they should not have let the reactor sit at 1500-1600 MW for over 12 hours, far too much xenon buildup had occurred and there was no way for the test to be carried out successfully. If the operators were allowed to perform their test without this interruption, there would not have been enough xenon poisoning to have lowered thermal power to 30 MW in the first place. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>godlikemojo gave a great answer, but there are some other factors:</p>
<p>The problem with low power is not just the instability of the reactor itself, but also the fact that various automated control systems do not function at this power level. Likewise, certain core sensors become unreliable (the two thermal power sensors start to disagree and lag one another).</p>
<p>Therefore the operators were flying by the seat of their pants. Basically, the RBMK was squirrelly and unstable at the best of times, and low power just increased the load on the operators. This was probably a factor in the unexpected drop to 30 MW.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>numerous automatic failsafes were overridden.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a red herring. Two automated reactor trip signals were disabled because the test was clearly going to trigger them. If either of these reactor trips had gone off, the explosion just would have taken place earlier. Possibly it would have been less powerful; you'd have to model it. This was all according to plan, except for the part where Akimov forgot to reengage the turbine trip.</p>
<p>To put it simply, the real killer at low power is the reduced boiling of the coolant which provides maximum latitude for the void coefficient to create a feedback loop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>RMBK reactors were inherently unstable at lower power levels. They had what's called a positive void coefficient. This means that voids in the reactor coolant (steam bubbles) increase reactivity. The design of an RMBK was such that lower power leads to more voids which leads to more reactivity and higher power output which leads to more voids...etc in a positive feedback loop. </p>
<p>In the RBMK, to respond to the power oscillations, the control rods will start moving in and out to try and stabilize this. Having graphite tipped rods combined with having a control system with a response time constant in seconds (which is  similar to the fuel's thermal time constant) means that the control rods are going to be trying to catch a power change, but will have trouble keeping up because it will be causing some of its own problems. Under a worst case condition it can drive a runaway condition requiring a reactor scram. When operated appropriately, the reactor scram (even with the graphite tips) would have sufficient margin to preclude a steam explosion. When not operated appropriately (with nearly all control rods out, which was the case during the explosion), a power excursion can occur which leads to a steam explosion.</p>
<p>All of the rods were out because the core was xenon-poisoned, and the reaction could barely be maintained even at this state. The correct response to this would have been to scram the reactor and then slowly power it back up over the next day or say as the xenon decays. The reactor operators on that night did the worst possible thing they could have, which was to take an already inherently unstable reactor in an unstable state  with almost all of the rods out and to increase power.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If they had done the right thing they would have gradually brought it back up over about 24 hours. But the window for the test was about to pass, so they pushed on trying to raise the power. They fully opened it up, the xenon eventulally burned off, and then what you have is a reactor ready to go with no control rods in, pretty much a bomb</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The series Chernobyl's last episode pretty much explains what happens.
They lowered the power output for too long.
Xenon poisoned the core.
They lowered it more.
Water+ xenon stalled it.
They stopped water but xenon poisoning was too strong..
Then they pulled out the control rods. Xenon slowly dissipated. And they got a power spike. With no water to absorb and control heat, process accelerated.
They pushed the AZ5 button, the graphite tips of rods made the core go critical.</p>
<p>That's how rbmk reactor explodes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
