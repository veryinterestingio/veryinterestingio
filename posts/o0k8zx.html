<p>It just seems to me that we have so many bright minds that something like this should be possible and operational in places of drought like California..</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fundamentally, salt would &quot;prefer&quot; to be dissolved in water than separate. Specifically, being dissolved is energetically favourable.</p>
<p>The upshot of this is that it takes a fixed minimum amount of energy to get the salt out of seawater. Of course none of our real processes (distillation, reverse osmosis primarily) are perfectly efficient, but even if they were we would still need that minimum amount of energy.</p>
<p>And that minimum amount of energy is very significant when you consider how much water we would want to desalinate. That energy has a monetary and ecological cost however we go about generating it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Also note that salt water and salt itself are pretty nasty, corrosive substances over time. Whatever infrastructure you build by the sea has greater costs of maintenance.</p>
<p>Also there are residues in salt water and micro-organisms that tend to mess up and clog systems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We do have facilities that do this in California, both reclamation and desalination. But neither are cheap or easy to do, thats just the nature of trying to get salt out of water and developing new technology. A clever way one near me does it is they don't purify the water to tap water level, but they do get the salt out and bring it inland. Then they dump it so that it percolates down into the existing aquifer, replenishing it over time, and that water is what wells draw from. It keeps the aquifer from being depleted or the saltwater from the ocean seeping in.</p>
<p>The biggest issue for California water, and the rest of the country that gets food from here, is that water rights have been utterly jacked up by politicians, lobbyists, and connected families. Industry and agriculture can basically take as much water from wells as they want and its not even metered in most places. Those aquifers will collapse soon if nothing is done, and once an aquifer collapses its done. No bringing it back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Their new desalination plants operate at 1/2 the cost due to their tech and they recycle about 80% of their waste water vs around a rate of 15% for the 2nd place country (Spain).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
