		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is because in specialized cells, different segments of our DNA are turned on or off. </p>
<p>For a more detailed answer, we first have to understand what DNA is made of. </p>
<p><strong>DNA</strong>, the classic double helix, is a long chain of bases that stores code for making proteins.</p>
<p>A <strong>gene</strong> is a length of DNA that codes for a specific protein. So one gene is dedicated to coding for the protein insulin, etc. Often many genes work together, for example there is evidence that as many as 16 different genes could be responsible for eye color in humans. </p>
<p>A <strong>genome</strong> is an organism's complete set of DNA, including all of its genes. However, genes, the protein-coding segments of DNA, only makes up about 2% of your DNA. The other 98% is called <strong>noncoding DNA</strong>.</p>
<p>Noncoding DNA contains regulatory messages that are capable of activating, suppressing, and even silencing genes. For a gene to be used, it has to be transcribed first. </p>
<p>There are many ways that a cell can regulate if and when a gene gets transcribed. A very common method involves <strong>transcription factors</strong> and <strong>promoters</strong>. Promoters are stretches of DNA that can be recognized by a class of proteins known as transcription factors. These proteins interact with the DNA to begin transcription (or block them from getting started). To put it more simply, transcription factors help draw attention to, or away from, certain genes.</p>
<p>In different types of cells, some genes are turned off and others are turned on. This specific combination of activated genes is called <strong>gene expression.</strong> Gene expression is a highly complex and tightly-regulated process. The different roles of cells, and thus which genes become activated, occurs as cells mature when your body is being formed. </p>
<p>The mechanisms that induce a non-differentiated cell to become a specialized cell are very complex, and to be honest, poorly understood. In a laboratory setting, it is possible to induce immature cells to differentiate into specialized cells by changing the physical and chemical conditions of growth. There are a ton of different chemicals and proteins involved in cueing a cell to specialize, and I'd recommend these sources if you want to know more: </p>

<p>TLDR: </p>
<p>Cells differentiate themselves through <strong>gene</strong> <strong>expression</strong>. Gene expression is the specific combination of genes that are turned on or off (expressed or repressed), and this is what dictates how a <strong>cell</strong> functions. Different types of cells have different genes turned on, which makes them each perform only their specific function.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Now thats not really a comprehensive answer, but the best ELI5 i can do:</p>
<p>Cells sense their surroundings. They sense chemical signals (hormones etc.) from other cells. They sense forces. They kind of tug on the substrate they sit on to see how stiff it is. They even sense topography (e.g. whether a surface is rough or smooth). </p>
<p>Depending on those factors, a stem cell may differentiate into different types of cells. E.g., a cell that is exposed to a flowing liquid (such as blood in a vein) is more likely to become an endothial cell (which line the inner sides of blood vessels).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now im sure thats not all there is and theres definitely more at work than just that, but thats the only part that i know a bit about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answers so far are correct, but I want to talk about a more direct layer of control called the “histone code”. Your DNA is wrapped around little balls called histones. Histones have all sorts of different little switches on them. When you pull the switches in certain combinations on clusters of histones, you can turn genes “on” or “off” to make proteins. Some histone clusters operate on the gene next to it, some operate far away from it. Some switch combinations mean neither on nor off, but rather “ready” - or as we say they are <em>poised</em> to be turned on or off more rapidly. </p>
<p>There are dozens of switches and we don’t know what all of them do just yet, but we have a pretty good idea what the main 5-10 do.</p>
<p>There are proteins called “chromatin modifiers” that go around flipping the switches. Depending on the cell type, different modifiers flip different switches. We don’t know exactly how everything is coordinated yet, but there are of course many layers - that is, there are proteins that control the chromatin modifiers. And proteins that control those, on up and up to so-called “master regulators” for each organ and cell type. If you go up high enough, many of the instructions are programmed in from conception by inheriting certain histone codes from your parents and are further established during development.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two ways a cell can tell what genes it needs to express in order to function according to the organ it is part of.</p>
<p>The first is it just inherits the gene expression pattern during cell dvision. For example when a muscle cell divides the division process also copy's what genes should be expressed by a muscle cell.</p>
<p>The other and far more complicated process is called 'cell differentiation' which describes the changes in a cells gene expression pattern when it is turning into a specific cell type. This is how a stem cell turns into all other cell types.</p>
<p>Differentiation is a multi step process. Eg a cell doesn't go straight from being a stem cell to a mature muscle cell. There are multiple stepping point in between and cell types often share stepping points. For example you may have hear of the three germ layers, mesoderm, ectoderm and endoderm. One of the first steps in animal development is when embryonic stem cells differentiate into all three of these layers. Cells from the mesoderm will go on to differentiate into heart and muscle cells while cells from the ectoderm turn into the skin and brain.</p>
<p>Differentiation is mainly caused and directed by messages a cell receives from its outside environment. Theses messages tell the cell both what it needs to become and what genes need to be turned on and off to do this. These messages mostly consist of signalling molecules come from other cells. These molecules direct differentiation by causing changes in a cells gene expression.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
