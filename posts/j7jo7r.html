		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 2 easy ways to infer significant population sizes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Fossilization is a very rare event. Therefore the rich fossil record requires a large potential number of dinosaurs to be fossilized </p>
</li>
<li>Species do not persist and evolve with small numbers. Disease, bad weather, natural disasters can and frequently do wreak havoc on populations. Small population sizes simply aren’t robust enough to survive in the long term</li>

<p>Basically, one thing you can do is try to calculate how much the environment could support based on some assumptions about plant productivity and grazer metabolism.  You can also make some comparisons with modern situations.  It's not an exact science.</p>
<p>However, one important thing to note is that dinosaurs population structure was weird.  You had a few large adults and a ton of small juveniles, quite different from modern mammals, because dinosaurs laid a lot of eggs and grew more slowly than mammals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is mostly inference based on modern-day analogues that have similar lifestyles (being food types, size, environment, etc.). </p>
<p>Sometimes additional support comes from finding a large of nests together, or fossil digs with a large amount of individuals of the same species, or fossil tracks of herd migration etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its mostly inference, so while we cant confirm its accuracy that well, its based on pretty good information and logic.</p>
<p>A couple bits of info give us some good estimates.</p>
<ol>
<li>The fossil record would require significant populations to produce the number of fossils that we fine.</li>
<li><del>Evolution requires a certain number of individuals or it grinds to a halt.</del></li>
<li>
<p>Edit: As has been pointed out, this very poorly worded, so I will rephrase.<br />
A certain sized breeding population is required to maintain a healthy population, or else inbreeding becomes the dominant force in the population, and most populations with inbreeding problems die out.   </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>We can estimate based on close evolutionary relatives how much food  a single member of a species would have required, and then calculate the &quot;range&quot; required to support a single member of that species, we can get a pretty good estimation of how many individuals could be supported in an area from that.  Its not close enough to get us perfect counts, but it can give us an idea of herd sizes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Its a bit more complicated than that, since you had a huge number of different species competing for food, but it gives us an idea of what kind of food requirements an area could support, we can then estimate the breakdown of species (from fossil records), adding in predators and a few other factors helps us get a more accurate count as well.</p>
<p>4) There are other tricks we can play, we know for example that large herbivore populations can and will eat certain plants to extinction (or local extinction) under certain circumstances, So if we have a large explosion in population followed by a sharp decline, we can take a stab at what happened (correlating with other data, to try and rule out other causes), comparing that to what happens with current species can help us figure out how many dinos there would have been in an area at a given time.</p>
<p>Now, this is all constantly changing, as more data becomes available, numbers can change, and the more specific you try to be the less concrete your numbers get. but it does give us a pretty good idea in macro.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
