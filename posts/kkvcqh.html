		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a sense, we do - that's what many recreational drugs essentially are (they're not supplements, exactly, but they either stimulate the same receptors or cause your body to produce more of the things that do).</p>
<p>But there are a few problems with it, as that intro should suggest.</p>
<p>First, over-release of neurotransmitters causes the body to compensate. It becomes less sensitive to that release, and this can make it impossible to feel their positive effects without help and can cause even the outside help to just get you back to baseline. This is part of why addiction escalates: the first use or two produces powerful euphoria before those mechanisms kick in, but addicts need more and more over time - and meanwhile feel steadily worse than their original baseline in between uses.</p>
<p>Moreover, many of these chemicals have secondary effects. They're not so simple as &quot;have dopamine -&gt; be happy&quot;. Serotonin, for example, plays essential roles in the digestive system, and overdoses of serotonin <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome" target="_blank">cause a serious medical condition that can straight up kill you</a> (it's an important side effect of serotonergic drugs like many antidepressants). This compounds with the previous bullet, and is why drug addiction has numerous physical side-effects, too.</p>
<p>EDIT: As others correctly note, this isn't quite the same thing as direct supplementation (which doesn't work for the simpler reason that most neurotransmitters don't cross the blood-brain barrier, so they'd have no way to get to your brain). There are supplements that do cross it that either are converted to neurotransmitters on the other side or stimulate production, and they do work to increase levels of that transmitter.</p>
<p>EDIT2: Hey, front page folks, ELI5 is explicitly <strong>not</strong> for actual 5-year-olds. See the sidebar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think the other posts are answering your question. Supplements of dopamine, serotonin, etc are not sold because those chemicals do not cross the blood-brain barrier. The blood brain barrier is essentially a filter, and it only allows specific chemicals into the brain, like glucose. So even if you took a pill that contains pure dopamine, it will not get to your brain. I think answers that say the ‘potential for abuse is too high’ are wrong, since a supplement of pure dopamine, serotonin, etc do not actually make it to the brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's dangerous to mess with brain chemistry too much. The human brain is designed to fucntion under a very specific condition. Modification of these normal conditions can go very poorly. Addiction, insomnia, hallucinations, paranoia, depression, and many other severe consequences (including death) can result.</p>
<p>Melatonin isn't as large of a risk because it only does one thing in your brain. Tell you it's time to sleep. However overuse can make it hard to sleep naturally or sleep as deeply.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The real reason here is actually because those molecules cannot cross the blood brain barrier, so we need drugs which CAN cross the blood brain barrier to go in and stimulate an increase in concentration of those same neurotransmitters through a different mechanism. And even if the neurotransmitter chemicals were able to cross the blood brain barrier, the half life of them would be ridiculously short.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
