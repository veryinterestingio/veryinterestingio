I thought it was just something your body produced, and apparently it can be used to slow your bleeding. So with that knowledge here is my question. If adrenaline makes your heart pump faster then why or how does it slow down bleeding if your heart is pumping more blood?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ER tech here. Adrenaline, or epinephrine as we call it in medicine, is responsible for the fight or flight response. In addition to raising the heart rate, it is a vasoconstrictor, ie, it causes your peripheral blood vessels (as well as those in your digestive organs) to constrict, slowing down the blood flow to those parts of the body that are not necessary for fight or flight (which is why people get a hollow feeling and become pale when adrenaline is released in their system, because there is less blood flow to the skin and digestive organs). This, in combination with increased heart rate, raises the blood pressure and increases blood flow to the skeletal muscles, ensuring they have the flow they need to sustain higher output than normal. It is because epinephrine/adrenaline acts as a vasoconstrictor, that frequently a small amount of it is mixed in with lidocaine (a numbing agent) for injection into wounds that need to be sutured, as it reduces the bleeding in the wound allowing for better visibility while suturing. It will reduce or stop bleeding from veins, especially smaller ones, but will do absolutely nothing to stop arterial blood flow. </p>
<p>Tl, dr: It causes your veins to narrow thereby reducing the blood flow through them.</p>
<p>Edit: I have been corrected, my last statement above is incorrect. Adrenaline does also act to constrict arteries, and there are cases where a severed artery in a limb has squeezed off to the point that blood has been able to clot and stem the bleeding. However, the pressure in the main arteries is high enough to sustain blood flow to the necessary regions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adrenaline has alpha and beta receptor activity causing arterial and venous vasoconstriction (that is they get narrower) in your peripheries, increased heart rate (mainly a beta effect) and increased myocardial contractility (heart squeezes harder to generate higher pressures). So while your cardiac output increases and blood pressure rises when being administered adrenaline your blood vessels get squeezed harder allowing less blood to flow through them and so stopping bleeding. This effect is organ and tissue specific so your gut will have less blood flow but your muscles will have more. There are more complexities there but I've kept it simpler.</p>
<p>There are other agents that have pure alpha activity such as noradrenaline or metaraminol that only make the blood vessels narrow without directly increasing heart rate.</p>
<p>Another one to look at is local anesthetic agents - think lignocaine/bupivocaine/ropivocaine (the stuff your dentist might use to numb you among other uses). there are formulations with low dose adrenaline in them that are injected in the target area. what it does is constrict the blood vessels decreasing blood flow through the area and causing decreased washout and metabolism of the local anesthetic into the general circulation and so makes the numbing shot last quite a bit longer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adrenergic agonists (epinephrine and norepinephrine) act on alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1, and beta-2 receptors as part of the sympathetic nervous system. Stimulation of the alpha-1 receptor located on smooth muscle cells leads to increased cytoplasmic calcium concentrations via the Gq-PLC-IP3 second messenger system; increased calcium results in contraction of the smooth muscle around arteries, thereby increasing blood pressure. Stimulation of the beta receptors results in increased heart rate and contractility via a different second messenger system. Thus, the sympathetic nervous system works to increase blood pressure. </p>
<p>In hypovolemic shock due to hemorrhage (blood loss), the body tries to compensate for volume loss by activating the sympathetic nervous system to constrict the blood vessels and increase heart rate and contractility. </p>
<p>Because epinephrine causes vasoconstriction, an injection will decrease blood flow to the site of injection. Subcutaneous epi is commonly used as a local anesthetic to control intra-operative bleeding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two types of system in our body which act in opposite ways and help us hugely to do our day-to-day activities. These are SYMPATHETIC SYSTEM and PARASYMPATHETIC SYSTEM. Sympathetic system works when some substances(chemicals) stimulate some receptor and some kind of action is produced. The Receptors are &quot;Alpha-1, Alpha-2, Beta-1, Beta-2&quot;. Now remember, Alpha-1 is present on the blood vessels and causes vasoconstriction and help in increasing blood pressure(think like putting your thumb in front of the hosepipe end to increase the pressure of water flow).Beta-1 receptor is in heart and it stimulates heart, therefore increasing heartbeat and blood pressure. Beta-2 is in Lungs, therefore, when this beta-2 is stimulated, small airways(bronchioles) get relaxed and becomes wider. Beta-2 can also cause vasodilation which will result in fall in BP, but it is a sensitive receptor and alpha-1 is strong receptor.  Now we know what are the receptor and what they do with respect to blood vessel and heart. Adrenaline is a chemical substance which will stimulate all the receptors, i.e. alpha-1 &amp; 2, Beta - 1&amp;2. Beta action on heart will cause increased heart rate, BP, but peripheral blood vessels will constrict because of alpha -1 action. As time passes and adrenaline is removed from your body, alpha-1 will stop acting(remember, alpha-1 is a strong receptor, it will act at high levels only) and Beta-2 receptor will start acting(vasodilation, i.e. BP will fall, remember beta-2 is a sensitive receptor), this is called vasomotor reversal(<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Vasomotor+reversal+of+dale&amp;rlz=1C1CHBD_enIN726IN726&amp;oq=Vasomotor+reversal+of+dale&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.4093j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">Google link</a>). Remember, I have only mentioned receptors and their action with respect to cardiovascular system only, Alpha and beta receptors are present everywhere. And they have different actions everywhere. But if you are a student and want to remember this type of info, then remember sympathetic system (sympathy from heart) will stimulate heart but relax everything else, this was the mnemonic our prof taught us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Searched the thread and didn't see this mentioned, but epinephrine acts directly in clot formation. Part of the formation of blood clots is mediated by bits of cellular remnant in your blood called platelets, which float freely until they are activated by chemicals released near wound sites. At that point they begin sticking together and sticking to the fibrin mesh that forms earlier in the process, forming the basis of the plaque that becomes your clot. Epinephrine facilitates this reaction and makes platelets more receptive to activation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
