		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Breast tissue remains immature in women until lactation. There's a reason your breasts feel swollen when you first become pregnant: immature lobule glands are changing. The longer you breastfeed, the more of these cells mature. The source of many cancers are immature versions of these cells.</p>
<p>There's a lot of interesting research going on right now though about the wider causes of breast cancer. Even light at night may play a role. Most breast cancer does not have a detectable cause or family history component. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I breastfed... And got breast cancer. One of my milk ducts became infected and turned into a tumor that I didn't know was growing until I felt a lump two years later. Stage three almost four at 35 years old, in three lymph nodes. They told me the tumor was caused by excess estrogen. Now I'm 44....just getting over it again. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am not trying to step on toes, but I am not sure if you are asking because you are curious, or concerned about developing breast cancer, but the best advice I can give you is know your body. I know I'm going to get hell for this, but I HATED breast feeding. Did not even make it a month and a half. However, prior to having my first child, a boy, I had lumpy, dense breast tissue, my mother had breast cancer at 45, and I had two times where they thought they found cancer but turned out to be lumpy breast tissue. Like you, I had heard that breast feeding reduced the chances of breast cancer, estrogen is bad, my MIL told me birth control caused best cancer and all these other &quot;scientific&quot; explanations. I was not satisfied with those answers, and was stressed out about finding a lump all the time. Especially after having a baby, and your breasts start doing all sorts of crazy things. So I got genetic testing done. I came back Chek2 positive. As explained to me the order of severity is BRAC1, BRAC2 then CHEK2. Pretty much a doctor said to me, because of all my factors, it was not a matter of IF I would get cancer but WHEN, and if they would even catch it in time because of my tissue, it made it hard to detect. When my son was 15 months old, I had a double mastectomy with reconstruction. I had a presurgery MRI and they thought they found cancer then, but again, benign. It was my choice, to give me piece of mind and to increase my chances of being there for my family. I could not have that looming over me especially when I could do something about it. Fast forward to my second pregnancy, I found MORE lumpy breast tissue where there should have been none. I had to have an ultrasound and a biopsy at 31 weeks pregnant. Came back benign, but they told me if the tissue does not go away 3 to 6 months after delivery, I need to go and get it checked out again. I love modern medicine, and am all about them finding out as much as they can about cancer. I have all sorts that run in my family, colon, lung, breast, etc. However, they still don't know as much as you think, for instance a new study is linking cancer development to the immune system aging. And there is still a lot of unknowns bease pregnant women aren't willing to sacrifice the safety and health of their children. The best advice I can give is know your family history, know your body and do what will give you piece of mind.
Fuck everyone else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't mean to be unhelpful, but the truth is that we don't really know.</p>
<p>The best theory I've heard is that there's a link between oestrogen production and breast cancer, and breastfeeding halts the menstrual cycle, which in turn reduces the amount of oestrogen produced, but halting one year(ish) worth of oestrogen seems unlikely to result in such a strong reduction in breast cancer risk.</p>
<p>There's also what's called a confounding factor (i.e. something linked to reduced risk of cancer, but not directly linked to breastfeeding) due to the decreased smoking/drinking rates among mothers who breastfeed.</p>
<p>I suspect that there's some sort of damage caused to cells in the breast by not expressing some of the milk that they generate, which could ultimately lead to cancer, but I'm not aware of any studies showing that.</p>
<p>Overall, though, I'd stick with my first point which is that there is no clear answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
