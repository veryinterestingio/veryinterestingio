		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they’re really hard to recycle. The whole point of a tire is to be <em>really</em> durable. They’re full of fibers and steel so they’re very hard to cut up. The rubber is molded around the fibers so they’re almost impossible to separate. And the base components (rubber, steel, carbon) are incredibly cheap so there’s almost no market value to the materials you’d recover. </p>
<p>The cheapest option is to just leave them in a pile. </p>
<p>Very large tires (trucks) can be retreaded several times and are reused.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most tires do get recycled, &quot;tire graveyards&quot; are just where they go to wait.</p>
<p>Also, burning tires to dispose of them isn't really a thing. Yes, tire fires happen sometimes and can be incredibly difficult to extinguish, but it's a myth perpetuated by the Simpson's that we just infinitely burn tires instead of recycling them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Toward the end of manufacturing, the rubber goes through a process called &quot;vulcanization&quot;.</p>
<p>This basically fuses the rubber molecules into one giant tire-shaped molecule. After vulcanization, it's not as simple as melting the rubber back down, since the rubber no longer melts, which makes it basically impossible to recover the rubber in a usable form.</p>
<p>(Some tires do get ground up and used for track surfaces or playgrounds, but that rubber couldn't be used in tires again)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of your used tires are recycled when you purchase from a large box retailer (Costco, Firestone, Americas Tire/Discount Tire). Hence to scrap recycling fee.</p>
<p>I have been in a few Manufacturing plants at this point in my career and speaking specifically about Bridgestone, the tires that are re-collected are generally made into building materials, roofing products, asphalt and even tires once more.</p>
<p>Early 1900's, Harvey Firestone, Henry Ford and Thomas Edison were on a ten year road trip titled &quot;The Vagabonds&quot; where they ultimately learned that recycling that Mr. Firestone was producing would lead to paving a roads for not only them but truckers across America.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
