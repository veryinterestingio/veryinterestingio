		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/journal-plague-year-180965222/" target="_blank">a Smithsonian article</a> a while back (I recommend reading it, it was really interesting and chilling) that explained that part of why the Spanish Flu epidemic was so deadly because it hit young healthy people the hardest. The virus infected the lungs, which made the immune system attack the lungs. With children, old people, and anyone who is immunocompromised, this was actually good (not good enough to prevent them dying, tho), because their immune systems were weak enough that it didn't damage their lungs too much. In healthy adults their immune systems basically nuked their lungs, which led to severe pneumonia, which led to death within a day or so, or even within a few hours. The lesions on the lungs caused by the immune system fighting the flu were comparable to lung damage from being gassed, according to the article. </p>
<p>The other big factor is that it was highly contagious, as flu tends to be. The killer part is that the government stuck its head in the sand and pretended like nothing was wrong, despite the urgings of basically every doctor. There are even newspaper articles from the time saying that it was just the regular seasonal flu, nothing to see here. Philadelphia refused to cancel a massive parade which brought the population of the city all clustered together outside, and six weeks later over 12,000 Philadelphians had died. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many different strains of flu, we get slightly different ones in flu season every year, that's why you need a different flu shot every flu season.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Towards the end of WWI a particularly bad one (currently called H1N1) started showing up. The war meant that it could spread very easily. You had crowded barracks, soldiers squatting in cold, wet, dirty trenches, hospital wards that were overwhelmed, trains crisscrossing every country ferrying troops back and forth, young men from across the countryside being called to centralized bases for training, and soldiers departing the front and going back home when they had leave or were injured.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>All of the warring nations censored any news of the flu. They didn't want the enemy to know that they were weakened, and if it wasn't virulent on the other side they didn't want the enemy to take countermeasures and gain an advantage.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's called the Spanish Flu because Spain was neutral in the war. When the disease reached Spain they reported on its severity honestly, so the first time the average citizen would have heard about it would have been when there were breakouts in spain. If the warring countries then took countermeasures and acknowledged it was going around their territory, it would seem like it spread from Spain, even if it actually was the other way around.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>H1N1 is one of those flus that hits people in their prime harder than it does children and the elderly. Strong adults have a healthier immune system that attacks the virus harder, which increases the risk of death from immune reactions like fever. Add to this the rampant malnutrition, poor sanitation and such, and people were more likely to catch it and more likely to die from it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Back at the turn of the century (1918-19) when a new type of flu (H1N1) appeared (originally thought to have originated in Spain which is where it got its name). Nobody on the planet had previous exposure to it so nobody had any antibodies/immunity built up to it. More sick people + more people susceptible = even more sick people.</p>
<p>Travel was becoming much cheaper/easier so sick people were capable of travelling further and spreading the disease as well. A few more things as well but that's about the ELI5 of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Spanish flu got started right as the world started to become smaller with flights and ships crossing the globe constantly in the wake of World War One. It affected young, healthy people below the age of 25 the most, presumably because those people hadn’t been exposed to similar diseases and so they didn’t have the partial immunity that older people did. </p>
<p>Most influenza, without treatment, has a pretty high mortality rate. In recent years we’ve made strides in both inoculation and curative medicine, so you’re less likely to get sick and less likely to die if you do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We still don't know for sure exactly where it emerged or what it was(most common theory is H1N1) but the reason it hit so hard was that unlike most flus, it hit young healthy people the hardest due to the infection causing an immune response that often killed the patient. </p>
<p>Extra credit recently finished a fantastic series about it if you would like to know more. </p>
