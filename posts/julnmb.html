One of the first ways <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_B._Prusiner" target="_blank">Stanley Prusiner</a> identified infectious prions was by treating brain extracts with an enzyme - proteinase K, which completely breaks down the normal, correctly folded cellular protein, yet leaves the beta-sheet core of the misfolded prion protein unscathed.  That core remnant remains infectious. </p>
<p>About the only thing that can effectively digest prions is lye-based digestion. Diagnostic labs in areas with high levels of CWD (another prion of deer/elk/moose, etc) have digestors - processing machinery the size of a large hot tub that they put the animals in to completely break down the carcass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The issue with prion disease is just how stable those little proteins are. That's why when they had the mad cow outbreak in the uk there were the pictures of the huge cattle bonfires as the infected animals were being incinerated. </p>
<p>A version of the prion protein exists in most mammalian brains (to the best of my knowledge). The infective prion has a change in the shape that renders the protein functionally ineffective, hence the disease. But the infective shape is so hyper stable that it actually exerts force on normal prion protein to convert them to the infective form, hence the disease spread.</p>
<p>Prions aren't like bacteria in the sense that they're alive and attempting to replicate. And they're not like viruses in the sense that they will adapt to replicate. It's just a protein that has very unfortunate property that our immune system has essentially no defense against (I'd wager that at least 90% of the prion protein is considered normal self by the immune system if not 100%).</p>
<p>And to answer your question more pointedly, our immune system has enzymes for breaking down useful proteins, but it's no where as effective as cooking. If cooking doesn't get it done, digestion alone won't denature the protein (or at least this specific protein).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off: we don't really know. It's incredibly difficult to properly study prions with our conventional histological methods. We're not even sure now if the prions survive in the stomach and cross over or if there is a more direct route (such as uptake in oral cavities). There is evidence that prion proteins are endocytosed along with iron and ferritin across tissues. There is also the theory that they cross the blood-brain barrier where there are small gaps (the blood brain barrier isn't the be all end biodome afterall). The mutated protein and agglomeration is caused by association of beta sheets. This is known as the secondary strucutre of a protein. It is stabilized by hydrogen bonding across the different sheets. They usually form slowly and take a lot of energy to get into the correct conformation. But once they are in the correct form, they're generally pretty stable. It reaches its energy minimum (the more the different parts of the amino acids fit into the puzzle). It's fairly hard to get out of this energy minimum. However, denaturation with either low/high pH or chaotropic agents are enough to change the amino acids in the beta sheet, which makes kinks in the stable sheet and causes the structure to collapse. Proteolytic enzymes can then get in can cut the proteins into smaller chains. But with prions, the beta sheets have stacked together in such a way that they don't easily denature. The stacked beta sheets are incredibly stable. I think they require over 200 degrees celsius to consistently denature. Now when these prions enter the brain, the beta sheets can still interact with other beta sheets - essentially from proteins in the process of being folded. Even folded proteins of the same type can be affected by the beta sheets from the prion. They can then cause these other well-folded proteins to stack on top of this growing prion. These aggregates do nothing but take up space and screw around with the functions of the cells. This is how I understand it. </p>
<p>I'll try the ELI5. Think of it this way:</p>
<p>A prion is a glitch rather than something alive or with an agency. Think of proteins as lego blocks that need to stick together in a specific order to do something. They come in different shapes and sizes. These lego blocks then come together to make different lego structures. Maybe a bed lego goes together with wall lego pieces, a roof made of lego, and other lego made things to make a house. This &quot;house&quot; is a protein. Now think of us eating these houses or spaceships or whatnot.</p>
<p>When these lego blocks go into our stomach, it's like hands pulling them apart. The other things inside the stomach also pull the bricks apart. The house gets knocked down so instead of being a house, it's a roof connected to a wall connected to a chair connected to etc. The stomach proteins target specific colour blocks. Say blue blocks. So anytime the lego blocks have a blue brick, it gets pulled apart. For most proteins, this breaks them down into smaller protein 'chunks.' These chunks then go into our intestines where they are broken up even further. Maybe now the other proteins in the intestines pull apart yellow and red bricks. Now we have tiny chunks. These tiny chunks can then be eaten up in our intestines. </p>
<p>But now imagine that the lego are all those god awful thin single pieces that will stick to any other lego piece. In the stomach, usually our lego spaceship of a protein is pulled apart to make it into a chain of lego pieces for the proteins to find their blue blocks. But now imagine it's just a small block made of those TINY LITTLE FUCKERS. The pulling and stuff in the stomach or intestine won't pull it into a chain so the blue block removing proteins can't split up the lego block. Then this block of tiny little lego blocks gets taken into the intestine and eventually into the blood. </p>
<p>It passes through the liver and can't be broken down, and then makes its way to the brain. It gets across the blood-brain barrier because they're small pieces. Now this is where things get really fucky.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of other lego blocks (amino acids in this case) that could be squares or rectangles or circles or traingles or whatnot, the prions are literally just those stupid 2 piece single layers. Usually they have a hard time making something because it uses a lot of finger pressures (our cellular energy) to put them into their correct shape. But somewhere along the line, a mutation happened. These 2 pieces are now in the perfect spot to line up perfectly. They form together to make this reallly reallly strong cube. It's almost impossible to pull them apart because of how stable this cube is. Now imagine this cube can stick to other lego pieces that are similar. They're like little squares. The growing cube can stick to the square pieces because it fits just so perfectly. The cube keeps growing because it keeps getting more pieces that stick to it properly. But the cube is still as strong as it was before. Now instead of making a spaceship or a house, these big cubes get in the way and steal pieces that are required to make the truck. </p>
<p>This is the best I understand prions. Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>its more like:<br />
Larger Protein -&gt; smaller proteins -&gt; spread around the body -&gt; accumulate in nerve tissue.  </p>
<p>prions are small proteins and can cross the digestive system into the blood, but they need help: they disguise by attaching to ferritin (a small protein the body needs and which rightly gets into the blood) to invade. </p>
<p>Once in the blood the prions still need to get into the central nervous sytem, which involves crossing barriers such as the Blood-Brain barrier.
It uses a similar trick to do that.  </p>
<p>Clever fuckers those prions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
