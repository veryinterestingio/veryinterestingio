		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Feeding pet lizards worms and grubs and then having the worms or grubs erupt from the lizard later is like, a serious problem that happens to old or sick lizards. You get a big huge warning from a lot of lizard care taking stuff to stop feeding a lizard worms if they are having any sort of other issue.  Because yeah, the lizard's body can't guarantee it and if the lizard is having other issues it totally happens. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The truth is, lizards and frogs kinda just suck. They have a real live fast die young construction to them. Humans have two or three babies that are meant to live 90 years, a lot of little animals are cheaply constructed by the dozen and fall apart constantly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There isn't really an issue with swallowing it, at least from a boa constrictor standpoint, I keep them. By the time they are actually being swallowed, they are dead or very close to it. They suffocate their prey before actually consuming it. It is however a problem from the catching prey standpoint. It can be dangerous for the snake to actually get the prey in its mouth, as in the mouse struggled and sliced open the snake. That's why its extremely common for enthusiasts to use frozen thawed rodents.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes they are poisoned or constricted, so if they are alive it is barely.</p>
<p>For others who just chomp something down, they just sorta crush the bugs in their throats and stomachs.  If the bug is compressed on all sides, it can't kick or do anything destructive inside, while it suffocates.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
