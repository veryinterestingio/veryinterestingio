		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The vacuum of space does not have a temperature, temperature is a property that materials have. For example, it's commonly said that deep space has a temperature of about 2.7 K, but that's misleading. 2.7 K is the equilibrium temperature that an ideal blackbody would reach in deep space due to cosmic microwave background radiation.</p>
<p>So a better question would be, how close would you have to get to the sun for an ideal black body to be at room temperature? Spoiler alert: close to where the earth is. The answer is found by balancing incoming solar radiation with the outgoing blackbody radiation of the object, a common problem in introductory thermo classes. The derivation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_equilibrium_temperature" target="_blank">here</a>, usually used to find the temperature of a hypothetical planet at a given distance, can be rearranged to solve for distance when given temperature, and the result is about 84 million miles, or 0.9 AU. This assumes the body is spherical, but an arbitrary shape would reach a similar temperature.</p>
<p>The difference between our hypothetical blackbody and the earth comes down to albedo (reflection), emissivity, and various greenhouse effects; if the earth were a perfect blackbody it would be about <del>40</del> 10 Â°C colder.</p>
<p>Edit: note, this only applies to something that isn't producing its own heat like a person or anything electronic. Any internal heat production means the body has to radiate more heat to reach equilibrium, resulting in a higher temperature. Additionally, it's hard to say how a person would <em>perceive</em> temperature in the vacuum of space (before dying, of course) since our perception of temperature is largely dependent on heat transfer and not necessarily absolute temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On Earth the <em>air</em>  has a temperature.  (Which varies from place to place and time to time.)</p>
<p>A total vacuum can't have a temperature  - whether we're talking room temperature,  colder than room temperature,  warmer than room temperature,  whatever.  </p>
<p>Other things that  are  <em>in</em>  the vacuum -  such as a rock  or a spaceship  - can have a temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's complicated because the only form of heat transfer in space is radiation.  That means if you are facing the Sun, you can easily have <em>that side of you</em> well above room temperature even at Earth orbit but <em>your back side</em> could freeze well below zero because it's NOT facing the sun but instead is facing an &quot;empty&quot; universe at 3 degrees Kelvin (insanely cold).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All corrections aside, can anyone answer the OP's actual question? </p>
<p>Rephrased: assume you are in a space suite that absorbs sunlight, what distance from the sun would you need to be to maintain a livable (room) temperature inside your sun absorbing suite? This can be answered using the albedo, insulating properties, and other relevant variables as, well, as variables, or as reasonably estimated constants. </p>
<p>Edit: For all those concerned about directionality of the photons, assume the suite can disperse and distribute the energy to maintain a near constant temperature (you can factor the energy needed to do so into the equation, if you wish). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
