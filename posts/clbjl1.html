By the time any frozen remains are thawed enough to be discovered, the cat's already out of the bag, so to speak. Ancient pathogens are a concern, especially as the permafrost continues to thaw. Here's an article about an <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/as-earth-warms-the-diseases-that-may-lie-within-permafrost-become-a-bigger-worry" target="_blank">anthrax outbreak</a> a couple of years ago, with a strain that had been frozen for almost 80 years. And here's one about some <a href="https://www.livescience.com/63187-siberian-permafrost-worms-revive.html" target="_blank">42,000-year-old frozen nematodes</a> that were recently revived. Bacteria, fungi, and viruses are all locked away in the permafrost, glaciers, and even lake ice, and many could be pathogenic when they wake up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello! </p>
<p>I am currently an archaeology student. (Just FYI I've never encountered remains preserved in ice or know anyone that has so this is just what I've learnt). </p>
<p>Everytime I've excavated, we are required to have up to date vaccines which are relevant to the area of the world we will be digging in - if you don't you're not allowed to go. </p>
<p>Digs are also required to have safety precautions which every person must read and usually sign in my experience - so if there was any possibility of encountering frozen remains, the safety precautions should detail how people are meant to handle them. </p>
<p>Since we'd want to conserve the remains until getting them to a lab, what would most likely happen is the remains would be block lifted so that they remain in the ice, and then placed in a cooling container or some sorts and transported to the lab asap. My conservation lecturer taught me that vulnerable remains are most likely never completely excavated on site - so frozen remains would be thawed out in a lab and eventually freeze dried or put through the process of tanning (basically turning into leather) or smth similar. Usually during these processes some sort of disinfectant or smth would be added to stabilise the remains. The thing with archaeology is that every discovery is very different so each situation has to be handled differently.</p>
<p>I don't have much more info, sorry!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Side note; it's not really archeology per se, nor ancient diseases, but fear of old bodies is entirely reasonable. My great-relative (great-uncle?) was a county coroner and died examining a body that had been found after being out all winter.</p>
<p>Scalpel slipped, he and his assistant knew how serious that was, they amputated my great uncle's hand within minutes, but it was too late. This was a few years before penicillin.</p>
<p>In answer to your question: not enough.</p>
<p>Edit: in response to requests for elaboration: This was in a Swedish county, a body was discovered in the spring thaw. My great-relative was a doctor and the official coroner whenever needed. it was therefore his job to figure out how the person had died. While my great-uncle was cutting the cadaver, the scalpel wound up cutting his hand.  Yes they knew this could well be a death sentence, hence the prompt amputation. From looking at the comments on Liston, one wonders if amputating a hand was also dangerous, but I presume they made a risk assessment. I don't know the details of the slip. Time period is the 1920s or early 1930s, I will have to check my notes if it matters, penicillin was not available.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't know about ice, specifically, but in my country all practicing archaeology students are required to update certain vaccines before going into the field. So any archaeologist encountering human remains or matter (apparently there's always a chance of feces) should be immune to the most common diseases. That's not going to help with superviri that have been in permafrost for thousands of years, but it's something.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
