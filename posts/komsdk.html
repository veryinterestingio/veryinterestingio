Same with someone like Adele. Why is this?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With regard to English specifically, an accent is mostly about differences in the pronunciation of vowels.  There's only one way to say the consonant &quot;n&quot;, but people from different countries pronounce &quot;o&quot; differently.  When a singer is singing, they tend to pronounce vowels for a longer period of time than in normal speech, so the differences in pronunciation fade away.</p>
<p>This makes me wonder if British people think that American singers sound British when they sing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Classically-trained vocalists are taught similar techniques. Back off on nasals, open your vowels, soften your R's, and so on. The result is a lot of singers have a very similar apparent accent when they sing. I'd guess it's somewhere in the vicinity of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_accent" target="_blank">Mid-Atlantic accent</a>, which isn't too far off from British Received Pronunciation.</p>
<p>But this is not a law of the universe. There are vocalists who sing distinctly in their own accents, or who can sing an imitation of another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most early blues, soul, r&amp;b, rock and pop music originated in the U.S. </p>
<p>European (particularly British) bands who were influenced by American pop music of the 50s and 60s tended to try to mimic the American style of singing, which often meant &quot;losing&quot; their accents.</p>
<p>So we've had several generations of pop music for which an &quot;American accent&quot; has become the default sound for many vocalists.</p>
<p>Conversely, if you listen to traditional folk music from the UK, you'll notice that their accents don't &quot;disappear.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I always thought it was cool how The Beatles would sound British in some songs and American in other songs.
