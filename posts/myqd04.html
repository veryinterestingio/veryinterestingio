So the thickening of the nail is the result of the fungus separating the keratin layers as it grows.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's worth mentioning that your nails thicken as you age (a whole other ELI5 that probably exists already). With fungus being more common in older people (from my experience), it can be harder to distinguish the thickening from age versus thickening from fungus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s definitely worth making sure that it is in fact a fungal nail. Years of micro trauma or one big trauma can change the angle (Lovibonds angle,) at which the nail grows giving it the appearance of an infection.
Telltale signs of fungus can be that it’s sponge like and may have little black tubes like something has burrowed into it. Also smell. A sample may be required to confirm but can often yield a negative result especially if applying topical anti fungal treatments. </p>
<p>This shit is exactly why I gave up being a podiatrist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have always been susceptible to tonail fungus. I am completely free of it now. Here’s how. </p>
<ol>
<li>Woolen socks. I don’t care what you think about cotton or other fibres. Wool is the way to go. It keeps your feet dry even when they sweat. Wool socks don’t need to be warm. Thin wool is cooler than cotton. Wool is amazing. By not allowing your feet to bathe in moisture you are half the way there. Never go back. Stay in wool socks and you are golden. Yes they are more expensive but they are much better and more comfortable. Don’t be fooled by plastic socks with a little wool. Ensure they are 50% or more wool by composition. Then buy some wool wash containing lanolin. Wool is so good at drying if you don’t replace the lanolin in the wool and strip it out with harsh detergents they can dry your skin and make it scratchy. </li>
<li>Use an anti fungal applied with a brush. Creams are the devil. You move then  infection as you try to cure it. Get a liquid with a brush. Then only wear woolen socks. It will clear up and stay clear. </li>
</ol>
<p>It’s also a good idea to let your shoes dry fully. If you wear the same shoes every day don’t do that. Give them at least a day between wearings, longer if you can. While you are getting rid of the infection don’t wear shoes inside. It gives your feet and shoes more time to dry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
