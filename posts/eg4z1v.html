		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Denim is so popular because it's a relatively durable material that's still pretty comfortable to wear and yet is cheap to boot, so it's pretty much the perfect material for the physical laborers that were the majority of people until very recently. Blue on the other hand is because blue dye was the cheapest, blue also doesn't show stains compared to many other colors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The indigotin blue dye isn’t soluble in water, and must be changed chemically before the jeans are dyed. The oxidised form (indigo blue) is insoluble in water, which helps the color stick to the jeans despite being washed hundreds of times. Other colors would fade too much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Denim became popular in the US during the mining boom of the late 19th century.  Until then, pants were mostly made of light-wearing materials like linen which couldn't stand up to the rigours of the industry.  A tailor called Jacob Davis made a pair of denim trousers by special request and when other people found out about it, demand skyrocketed pretty quickly.  Unable to keep up alone, he made a deal with Levi Strauss &amp; Co. and together they started mass-production in San Francisco.  Various mining industries continued to boom for the next hundred years or so and during this time, jeans became the staple for working men all over the States.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Specifically on the color:</p>
<p>The blue of jeans is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigo_dye" target="_blank">indigo dye</a>. Indigo is a group of plants found throughout the tropical parts of the world. The indigo plant is a legume; that is, it's related to peas and beans. It is found mostly in the tropics.</p>
<p>The same blue dye chemical can also be made from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isatis_tinctoria" target="_blank">woad</a> plant, which is native to England and northern Europe. Woad is a brassica; that is, it's related to mustard, cabbage, and broccoli.</p>
<p>Indigo and woad have been popular fabric dyes for literally thousands of years, long before Levi Strauss or anyone else was making blue jeans. People mostly prefer to wear dyed fabric rather than uncolored fabric, both for decoration and because uncolored fabric shows stains or wear very easily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
