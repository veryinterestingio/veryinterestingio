		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So causing tides by itself does not really require energy. The tides appear to be moving because the Earth is rotating underneath the &quot;bulge&quot; of water caused by the tides. So, if you were far away from Earth and not rotating, the bulges of water would always be (almost) aligned with the line between the Earth and the Moon (with a larger bulge on the side closer to the Moon and a smaller one on the opposite side). If the Earth were a perfectly smooth sphere with no friction, this actually wouldn't take any energy to obtain, the Earth would just rotate underneath a non-spherical mass of water. </p>
<p>But, since the Earth is not a perfectly smooth sphere, there is energy being lost due to friction. As you can imagine, this is a rather small amount, when all is said in done, as there isn't a ton of friction between water and the ground, but there is some. That friction is causing the Earth to slowly slow down its rotation. </p>
<p>That energy is actually <em>transferred</em> to the Moon through a rather complicated mechanism. Since the Earth rotates faster than the Moon, the friction actually &quot;pushes&quot; the bulge of the water a little ahead of the line between the Earth and Moon. The bulge being a little ahead of that line actually provides a tiny little tug on the Moon, making it orbit just a little bit faster. This is minuscule, as you might imagine, but over a long time (billions of years), it starts to add up. When the Moon was formed, days on Earth were only ~5 hours long, and the Moon was only about 14,000 miles (~22k km) away from Earth. Now, the Moon is about 250k miles (~400k km) away from us, and the Earth's <del>orbit</del> revolution takes 24 hours. </p>
<p>The Moon gaining energy does two things- it pushes it further away and at the same time slows it down. To understand why, if you look at orbits, orbits are &quot;bound systems&quot; (meaning they have a negative total energy) where the negative potential energy is greater than the positive kinetic energy. So, as orbiting systems gain energy, the energy of the total system must get larger, which really means closer to zero. To do that, the potential energy gets smaller (move further away) and at the same time, kinetic energy must decrease. This is why Mercury (the closest planet to the Sun) moves so much faster than Neptune (the furthest). All of this leads to the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-12311119" target="_blank">Moon leaving us at a rate of ~1.5 inches (4 cm) a year.</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> changed orbit to revolution</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The energy comes from the earth slowing down its rotation. Part of that energy goes to the moon, which gains &quot;height&quot; from the earth (greater height=greater potential energy) and the rest becomes heat lost through friction.<br />
<a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/654/dissipation-of-tidal-energy#:~:text=The%20moon%27s%20gravity%20imparts%20tremendous,tides%20throughout%20the%20global%20oceans" target="_blank">Tidal losses are not just water sloshing around, its complex.</a>.</p>
<p>Thermodynamics and entropy are a thing so if it moves it loses.</p>
<p>At least a bit must go to the friction within say continental plaques rubbing around. The earth inside is partially molten and something goes there as well.<br />
Another fraction (can be minuscule) can probably be found in the atmosphere. Even if 800 times less dense than water at sea level, air flows would be affected by gravity and wind dissipates energy through friction.</p>
<p>I wish I could find values for these other values.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The earths rotation is slowed down by the moons gravity. As the moon pulls on the earth, it deforms the earths. Part of that deformation is that water pools at the near and far side of the earth with respect to the moon. Those are your high tides. </p>
<p>The deformation slows the rotation of the earth by a tiny bit. The earth is slightly more pointy towards the moon. As the pointy bit moves away from the moon, the moon pulls on it, slowing the earth down. Meanwhile, the earth deforms a bit again, creating heat in the process. </p>
<p>The rotation of the moon has already been slowed so much by the gravity of earth, that it is no longer rotation. The same side faces the earth constantly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>i’m like 100% sure everyone is missing what OP is asking and everyone is breaking down the mechanics of tides. pretty sure he’s asking bigger picture where is the energy coming from that causes the earth to spin and then that leads to the sun and how much does it have left until it runs out type of question.</p>
<p>edit : he’s just asking someone to  explain the family tree of what causes what to move and how much until it runs out because its finite.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like most of the answers here are missing the point. You asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know the moon's gravity causes it but from the looks of it, it seems to be creating energy out of nothing which should be impossible, like, does it come from the energy of the moon's orbit?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The energy comes from the Big Bang initially, at least that is until someone proves that expanding space is also creating energy.</p>
<p>When particles of matter eventually condensed (1 second to 20 mins after the Big Bang), they were moving around randomly in all directions, but if you considered only a small volume of the universe then you'd probably see that some were moving in one direction more than others.</p>
<p>As space expanded and cooled, particles were attracted to each other and clumped up. Because locally more were moving in one direction than another, they formed large spinning clouds that slowly collapsed.</p>
<p>The energy of motion that the Moon and the Earth have came from that initial motion that the particles had.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If so then does that mean the moon will eventually crash into the earth in however million years?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As others have said, energy can be swapped between physical objects like the Earth and the Moon. The Earth has kinetic energy because of its spin, and the Moon can steal some of that energy via gravitational interactions. That energy will give the Moon a bit of a push and make its orbit bigger, ultimately leading to it moving farther away from Earth over time, and because it's stealing some of the Earth's 'spin' energy the rotation of the Earth is slowing down and our days are getting longer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
