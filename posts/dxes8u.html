		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There have been studies of people going into surgery and undergoing different procedures. People who were given pain medication BEFORE getting hurt ended up using less pain medication than people given pain meds after they were already hurting. Scientists believe that once those pain pathways in your nervous system are activated, it's harder to turn them off.</p>
<p>So...your pain medication should be already working before you hurt yourself, and even better than if you took it post pain!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you don't know how badly you hurt yourself in the second case compared to the first one. You just know that you did something to yourself and it hurt. Without the painkillers already in your system it would have hurt you more but you are just feeling the residual pain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nobody has actually identified the mechanism - itâ€™s called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation" target="_blank">receptor upregulation</a>.</p>
<p>Chemical interact with proteins in the cell wall called receptors that function like a lock and key. When the receptor gets stimulated it causes a change in the cell. Your body is constantly making new receptors as the proteins have a lifespan.</p>
<p>Your body wants to maintain homeostasis - so if a receptor is getting over stimulated the receptors will down regulate (make less of) or under stimulated the receptors will upregulate (make more of).</p>
<p>There are several different type of receptors that are stimulated by opioids. Your body has natural neurotransmitters and hormones that hit the receptors as well.</p>
<p>When you take opioids these receptors become overstimulated and your body makes less of them. Consequently it will take more opioids to produce the same stimulation as your body continues to down regulate.</p>
<p>This is the mechanism of tolerance - which is what I think you are asking. </p>
<p>This is why people are at the highest risk for overdose after a period of not using. In the absence of the opioids there body starts to produce more receptors. Then they go use the same amount they used to - but this time there are more receptors and more stimulation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
