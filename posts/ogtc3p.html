		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can’t scratch is not the same as can’t damage.</p>
<p>Every time your skin contacts a piece of steel, it’s leaving behind oils and moisture.</p>
<p>The oils and moisture can chemically corrode the steel surface ever so slightly, forming iron oxide.</p>
<p>While iron oxide is still harder than your skin, it’s also weak, porous, and brittle. The next touch or cleaning can wear it off, exposing clean steel that can be corroded and eroded again.</p>
<p>It might only be a few molecular layers at a time but over hundreds of thousands of uses the wear adds up to a noticeable amount.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The scratch test only shows visible damage. However, at any interaction, between any materials, there will be surface changes on both. A few atoms will get randomly displaced even on the &quot;harder&quot; material, simply due to the way the interaction energy is distributed. You will always get a few atoms knocked off due to outlier values for interactions.</p>
<p>So you get a few atoms moved, and then again, and then again... Over a large number of interactions, it starts to add up.</p>
<p>Do not assume that the scratch test means there are no changes whatsoever to the harder material. There are always some changes. Given some ridiculous timeframe (geologic scale), you could probably polish a diamond with butter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Don’t treat real stuff like physics theory.</p>
<p>Your hands are dirty, the are not pure skin, sand on you hand, dirt, or other debris, can really enhance how abrasive you are.</p>
<p>(For example, air is easily cut by steel, however, wind erodes steel; not because air is a hard solid but because it carries hard solid particles)</p>
<p>Edit: HEY, thank you all for the replies, fun facts, and thoughts. I’m really happy my post served this community well.</p>

<p>The metal could also corrode (turn to rust) even from the sweat on your palms. It’s not much, but it doesn’t take much. Especially for just a surface layer</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
