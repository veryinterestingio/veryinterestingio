		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Money is an abstract concept, but it is tied to things that are absolutely real.  When you monkey around with money in the way you are thinking its a bit like a carpet with a wrinkle in it.  You can push the wrinkle about, but you cannot get rid of it.  Someone is always going to be left short.  </p>
<p>Think about it this way.  If you and your friends all agreed to do chores for each other, and the chores you had to do were recorded on slips of paper, what's to stop a slip from getting destroyed or new slips made?  Nothing right?  Except that destroying a slip means a chore doesn't get done, and creating a slip means a chore gets done twice.  There are real world consequences to those slips of paper with bits of writing on them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simplest answer is because we cannot hit pause on our consumption of items that have &quot;value&quot;, e.g. food, rent, public transport or petrol for your car, etc.</p>
<p>Businesses need to continue to pay rent and salaries, people need to continue to eat, etc. And because the global economy is dependent on everyone continuing to transact with each other at an expected or ever-increasing rate, hitting pause is the exact thing that will cause a global economic crisis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I never studied economics either. I study biology, but there is a useful corollary called and ESS (evolutionarily stable system). An ESS is system that is stable because it is not easily disrupted by 'defectors', individuals whose behavior doesn't align with the system. Infinite generosity is not an ESS because a single individual who chooses to be greedy will disrupt the whole system by preying on those who follow the rulse. Often, infinite greed is also not an ESS because a few moderately generous individuals may be able to work together in times of scarcity and perform better than greedy solo actors. The true ESS is usually somewhere in between, where most individuals are sometimes greedy and sometimes benevolent, and the mostly-greedy individuals are balanced out on average by the mostly-benevolent individuals.</p>
<p>What you describe is possible in theory over a short period of time, but it is not evolutionarily stable because if we all 'agree' that when a crisis is over we will just reset, there are enough people who will benefit from defecting from that agreement and later advocating against it that the policy will never be followed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My ma always told me that the markets are driven by fear.  Her degree is in journalism but she does a lot of complicated financial writing.</p>
<p>Basically what you’re asking for would require absolutely everyone across the world to agree not to panic and also trust that things would continue on after the pandemic, exactly the way they did before.  Which are both longshots at best.  So people start to hedge their bets.  Which creates a downturn.  Which people see and think it’s a sign of things to come.</p>
<p>It becomes a cascading effect snowballing across entire market and totally unrelated sectors.  At the end of the day people are the market, not things.  If people don’t have confidence in a global outlook, the market reflects that and ends up becoming an egg that created the chicken.</p>
<p>It’s really fuckin silly.  However it’s also an evolutionary response to some degree.  Shit starts going south, people start getting nervous.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
