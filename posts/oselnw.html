		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, it confers passive immunity that last as long as antibodies circulate the system </p>
<p>Since the baby only received the antibodies, his own cells never learned to produce the antibodies. To gain active immunity the baby’s cells have to come in contact with the virus or antigen from the virus. This antigen is absorbed and presented to memory B cells who in turn make the antibodies</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. You’re only giving the baby antibodies against the virus, not exposing them to a viral antigen. Think of it like mom giving the baby an infusion of antibodies like when people in hospitals are given monoclonal antibodies to combat an active infection</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So breast milk antibodies are mostly IgA.  IgA is the antibody that stays in your gut or on your sinuses or surface of your lungs to protect mucosal areas from infection.  So babies that are breastfed have a very modest decrease in the number of enteroviral infections-the gut viral infections are prevented by the IgA.</p>
<p>Now, IgA is a protein, and most proteins that big don't get into the bloodstream when you eat them.  So it isn't going to help protect you from pneumonia.  Unless you're snorting the breastmilk, which having seen the way some babies eat might be possible.</p>
<p>The bigger protection is that during the final trimester of pregnancy, IgG, the protective antibody that you want in your blood, is actively pumped across the placenta directly into the baby.  So babies are born with many of hte antibodies their mothers made,  The half life of these antibodies is about a month, so they have decent protection from many things for a few months.  But by 4-6 months these are gone and the baby has to rely on its own antibodies it makes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No mothers passing antibodies to their infants usually only lasts upwards of 4 months I mean when the kid hits about 4 months old that that immuno protection provided by the mother via breast milk is pretty much over because the child's own immune system has picked up to the point it will actually fight off any antibodies the mother tries to pass on to the infant because the child is developing its own system for protection and immunity.</p>
<p>Babies need to be vaccinated  To actually have long lasting protection against any disease especially covered 19</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
