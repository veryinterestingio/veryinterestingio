		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You'd most likely see a strong blue line, with a broad spectrum covering the other colors (on the long-wavelength side of blue).</p>
<p>The reason is the typical white LED is actually a blue LED which lights up a phosphor that produces the other colors. But the phosphor can only produce colors with lower-energy photons than the blue that excited it.</p>
<p>ETA: It's also possible to make a white LED by combining blue, red, and green LEDs, in which case you'd see 3 distinct lines in the output spectrum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>White LEDs, as in those we use for lighting purposes, are not green, red, and blue LEDs stuck next to each other. They are blue LEDs covered in phosphors that absorb some of the blue and emit the rest of the spectrum. Similar idea to fluorescent lamps, which are a UV mercury lamp covered in phosphors. Note these phosphors aren't phosphorescent (glow faintly in the dark for a long period after they are exposed to light), they are fluorescent (glow immediately upon being exposed to light). The term phosphor covers both cases. </p>
<p><a href="http://tapnewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/led-lighting-2.jpg" target="_blank">Here are the spectrums for various types of lamps.</a>, this is what you would see. So no, if you focused a white LED lamp/bulb through a prism, you'd see a normal rainbow. Not necessarily with the same intensity of each colour as sunlight, but you'd see them all. More so for a cool/daylight/high temperature bulb, a warm/low colour temo model which would look more like a flame or incandescent bulb and have very little noticable blue/violet. </p>
<p>However, if you took a OLED or LCD screen's white light from a white image and put that through a prism, you'd see green, blue, and red spikes. There's also a chance cheap, crappy white LEDs might be the same combination, like say some LED Christmas lights.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer as always is 'it depends'.  </p>
<p>If it is an RGB led with 3 discrete diodes in the package that mix to visible white, then the prism will split them into neat little r, g, and b, bands.  </p>
<p>If it's the more modern 'white' led, depending on its ingredients it will have a spectrum with various peaks and troughs based on those ingredients. The smoother the spectrum, the higher quality the led in general -- These are often referred to by their colour rendering index, or CRI. 'high CRI' bulbs cost more but look better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bounce it off a CD which acts as a diffraction pattern.  This works much better than a prism.  A DVD also works but the track spacing is a little too close.  If you have an LED flashlight that should also work better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoAZ-u6hn6g" target="_blank">interesting video by Matthias Wandel</a> on the subject where he uses a CD as a sort of prism to compare light refracted between CFLs and high quality LED bulbs.  In this case, his high-CRI value LEDs produce a much smoother distribution across the spectrum than the cheap CFLs, which I found somewhat surprising.  I know they have high CRI value bulbs now, but that's impressive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
