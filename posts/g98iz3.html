		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Important point, I think you might be confused about what &quot;peer review&quot; means. Scientists publish their findings in peer reviewed journals, which means you submit your paper to a journal and then usually 3 other scientists working in a similar field review the paper for accuracy, make sure your methods make sense, see if you're drawing incorrect conclusions, etc. Their monkey research findings will be published with these standards. The actual process of designing and undertaking clinical trials, and the methods for determining efficacy and safety, are regulated very tightly by government organizations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The peer review process can be extremely fast, on the order of a week.  Scientists are just reading the report and looking for flaws in the research methods, results, and conclusions.  </p>
<p>For a project of this magnitude, it will not be hard to find scientists to drop what they're doing and lend their time.</p>
<p>As pointed out already, this group apparently justified moving quickly to larger scale trials because of prior related work.  It's great news.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I’ve been a lab tech in a couple different vaccine research labs for the past 3 years. As such, I definitely still consider myself a “fledgeling” in the field and am by no means an expert. That being said here’s my answer based on my experience so far, with some background info on vaccines if you’re interested.</p>
<p>In order to understand the timeline of vaccine research and how it can be streamlined, I think it’s important to understand the components of a vaccine. If you already have a good understanding you can probably just skip this whole paragraph. For those of you not familiar though, a vaccine platform basically consists of two or three components. The first is the antigen(s), which is generally either a piece of the pathogen or a protein/molecule engineered to mimic a piece of the pathogen. This is what you generate antibodies against so that your body recognizes the pathogen when you get infected for real. The second component is the adjuvant. An adjuvant is basically a compound or molecule that your body can <em>immediately</em> recognize as foreign and dangerous. It essentially is what tells your immune system that it needs to mount an immune response to the antigen and how that response should be carried out. It should also be noted that an adjuvant does NOT have to be from the pathogen your are immunizing against, and very often is not. The third component is the vector or method of delivery. Old school vaccines, such as heat-killed or some live-attenuated (weakened) pathogens, don’t really have a vector per se since you’re just being injected with the virus/bacteria/etc that causes the disease. Most “new age” vaccines however have some sort of special delivery mechanism in order to tailor or boost the immune response, or just for safety reasons.</p>
<p>Anyways if you’re still bearing with me, adjuvants and vectors need to be studied extensively outside of animals and in a “lower” animal model such as rodents before you have any chance of pairing them with a specific antigen and putting them in primates, let alone humans. Most adjuvants and vectors undergo years of testing for toxicity, dosage, efficacy, how they work mechanistically, etc before they’re ever used in a real vaccine. This in my opinion is easily the most time-consuming part of creating a vaccine.</p>
<p>With a lot of these COVID vaccines being researched however, they’ve already extensively tested their adjuvant/vector systems prior to this outbreak. Some of them are even luckier in that they’ve already tested for vaccine efficacy in humans/primates in the context of other diseases, such as Ebola (I.e. they already used the same adjuvant and vector in humans/primates but with a different antigen). Even luckier still are those like this lab that were actually testing their vaccine for another closely related Coronavirus. In theory, a vaccine that elicits a type of immune response that is protective against one pathogen is very likely to be protective against a similar pathogen, since the two pathogens should act fairly similarly on the body. All of these factors essentially allow COVID vaccine researchers to essentially skip steps in the process so that they can begin primate studies much quicker, since they already know the <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> of how their vaccine will work. The antigen on the other hand generally doesn’t require nearly as much independent study, other than that it will not cause any dose-dependent adverse effects, because most antigens are relatively inert on their own.</p>
<p>A typical primate study, in my experience will last at least a few months, sometimes as long as a year. If none of the animals show adverse reactions to either the pathogen OR the vaccine itself, that’s a pretty good indication you’re ready to move to human trials. Here’s a general checklist of things that are looked for in primate studies: Does the vaccine confer protection? Does the vaccine cause any adverse effects? How soon before/after infection does the vaccine need to be administered before you see a drop in efficacy? Does the vaccine confer lasting protection, or will you be able to get sick after some amount of time later? Is a booster injection necessary? Is there any danger in repeat exposures to the vaccine? Is there any danger in vaccinating an animal who has already been infected and recovered previously? If you design your experiments efficiently, I’d say the primate phase could be over in around 6 months.</p>
<p>I’ve never worked directly with any human trials, but basically they look at many of the same questions asked in primate studies but start in a very small group of humans before scaling up. Furthermore, in humans you can focus on specific variables such as gender or health problems that may affect how the vaccine works. Human trials happen in phases, the sum of which usually lasts a year or two, which is generally dependent on urgency, the number of available test subjects, scalability of the vaccine production, etc.</p>
<p>Anyways that’s my very long-winded, nitty-gritty explanation. TL;DR most of the researchers you’re hearing about in the news have already extensively tested 2/3 of their vaccine prior to the outbreak and now just need to verify that it works with a new antigen. This can be done normally in about 2 years if done efficiently and all goes well, but due to the urgency and ample number of test subjects, can probably be streamlined to a year in an absolute best case scenario</p>
<p>Bonus factoid, the vaccine platform they’re using in the study you linked is known as an Adenovirus vector. Basically it’s a different, mostly harmless virus that has been genetically modified to express a COVID protein (the antigen). This vaccine platform was studied extensively during the Ebola outbreak earlier in the decade and was a vaccine front runner for Ebola, along with the rVSV platform (another harmless virus genetically engineered to express COVID protein/antigen) which if I’m not mistaken is what they ended up using  towards the tail-end of the outbreak.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Most other teams have had to start with small clinical trials of a few hundred participants to demonstrate safety. But scientists at the university’s Jenner Institute had a head start on a vaccine, having proved in previous trials that similar inoculations — including one last year against an earlier coronavirus — were harmless to humans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Armed with safety data from their human trials of similar vaccines for Ebola, MERS and malaria, though, the scientists at Oxford’s institute <strong>persuaded British regulators to allow unusually accelerated trials while the epidemic is still hot around them</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So who knows if the FDA will allows those vaccines to be used in the US if the trials prove successful. On a related note, the article also mentions this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Donors are currently spending tens of millions of dollars to start the manufacturing process at facilities in Britain and the Netherlands even before the vaccine is proven to work, said Sandy Douglas, 37, a doctor at Oxford overseeing vaccine production.</p>
<p>“There is no alternative,” he said.</p>
<p>But the team has <strong>not yet reached an agreement with a North American manufacturer, in part because the major pharmaceutical companies there typically demand exclusive worldwide rights before investing in a potential medicine.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don't know how true that claim is, though. Obviously would be very maddening if that's the case, but who knows if the other &quot;part&quot; of the reason they left out is FDA regulations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
