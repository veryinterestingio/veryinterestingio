		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The five first vitamins discovered, between 1910 and 1920, were named A, B, C, D and E. Interestingly, D had originally been lumped together with A until it was later discovered that “two separate factors were involved.”</p>
<p>When a second, similar property to the vitamin originally named B (Thiamine) was discovered in 1920, both were renamed to B1 (Thiamine) and B2 (Riboflavin). The remaining B vitamins were lumped together under the designation “B complex” due to:</p>
<p>Loose similarities in their properties, their distribution in natural sources, and their physiological functions, which overlap considerably . . . .</p>
<p>These Bs are not necessarily designated in chronological order, as B12 (Cobalamins) was discovered in 1926, B5 (Pantothenic acid) and B7 (Biotin) in 1931, B6 (Pyridoxine) in 1934, B3 (Niacin) in 1936 and B9 (Folic acid) in 1941. The missing Bs are substances originally thought to be vitamins, but later reclassified.</p>
<p>Today’s vitamins skip from E to K because, like several of the Bs, substances that were once thought to be vitamins were reclassified. For example, vitamin F is today known as the essential fatty acids (omega 3 and 6). Similarly, vitamin G was reclassified as B2 (Riboflavin), and vitamin H is now Biotin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's like how you try to organize your files and create folders and now there is an awkward misc folder and then there are files that have the potential to be more than one folder and now you are stuck.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
