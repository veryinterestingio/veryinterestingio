		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wet objects aren't darker: they're <em>more transparent</em>.</p>
<p>Put a spot of water on a piece of paper and look down on it: the wet spot looks darker than the rest of the paper.  Now hold it up to the light: it looks brighter!</p>
<p>See /u/Flavored_Teeth 's answer: when light strikes a fibrous or granular surface like cloth, paper, or dirt, it bounces off the surfaces of all those fibers or grains, ping-pongs around a bit, and eventually much of the light bounces back out to your eyes.  As a result, these surfaces look light-colored.  But if you add water, you reduce the reflection off the fibers or grains (because the difference in index of refraction between the material and water is less than the material and air).  So the light penetrates deeper, is more likely to be absorbed or pass completely through rather than bouncing back out.</p>
<p>Most of the time when we look at things, both we and the light source are above the material, so dry things look brighter, wet things look darker.  But if the material is between us and the light source, it's the other way around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you look at a surface like sand, bricks, etc, the light you are seeing is reflected by diffuse reflection.</p>
<p>With a flat surface like a mirror, light falling on the surface is reflected back at the same angle it hit the surface (specular reflection) and you see a mirror image of the light falling on the surface. However a material like sand is basically lots of small grains of glass, and light is reflected at all the surfaces of the grains. The result is that the light falling on the sand gets reflected back in effectively random directions and the reflected light just looks white.</p>
<p>The reflection comes from the refractive index mismatch at the boundary between between air (n = 1.004) and sand (n ≈ ≈  1.54). Light is reflected from any refractive index change. So suppose you filled the spaces between the sand grains with a liquid of refractive index 1.54. If you did this there would no longer be a refractive index change when light crossed the boundary between the liquid and the sand, so no light would be reflected. The result would be that the sand/liquid would be transparent.</p>
<p>And this is the reason behind the darkening you see when you add water to sand. The refractive index of water (n = 1.33) is less than sand, so you still get some reflection. However the reflection from a water/sand boundary is a lot less than from an air/sand boundary because the refractive index change is less. The reason that sand gets darker when you add water to it is simply that there is a lot less light reflected.</p>
<p>The same applies to brick, cloth, etc. If you look at a lot of material close up you find they're actually transparent. For example cloth is made from cotton or man made fibres, and if you look at a single fibre under a microscope you'll find you can see through it. The reason the materials are opaque is purely down to reflection at the air/material boundaries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most ELI5 explanation I could make: It's reflecting the same amount of light, just not in the direction you're looking. Very rough opaque surfaces like cloth or cement reflect light uniformly in all directions. Water works like a lens, redirecting light towards some narrow directions back (reflection) and forward (refraction). </p>
<p>So when looking at a wet surface you could see all the light from a lightbulb only if you look at certain direction, but it'll be very bright. In the case of cloth or other absorbant materials the water fluid gets the same structure of the materials, and most of the light is bounced <em>through</em> the material towards whatever is under it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am not sure if this is allowed, but after reading the other answers, and great they are; it got me curious, so I Googled it and found <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2010/11/11/3063513.htm" target="_blank">this</a> amazing article. </p>
<p>I’ll paste it below. If this is against the rules I’ll remove it.</p>
<p>The speeds of light</p>
<p>We think of light as waves that travel in straight lines at a constant speed — 300,000 kilometres per second. But that's only true for light travelling in a vacuum, like empty space. Whenever light has to travel through anything with actual molecules floating around in it — like air, water or fabric — it slows down.</p>
<p>The slowing down happens because whenever light bumps into an atom or molecule, it gets absorbed and spat out on the other side. And all that absorbing and spitting takes a tiny fraction of time, so the light passes through any material more slowly than it would through empty space. Air doesn't have too many molecules to bump into, so it only slows light down a tiny bit (0.03 per cent). But water has way more molecules than the same volume of air, so light really has to work the room when it goes through the wet stuff — it's 25 per cent slower in water than it is in space.</p>
<p>And fabric is even more dense than water, so light slows down by a massive 33 per cent travelling through your t-shirt. The speed of light through a material compared to its speed in a vacuum is called its refractive index. The refractive index of empty space is 1, and air is 1.0003. Water has a refractive index of 1.33, and fabrics are all about 1.53.</p>
<p>But it's not the speed that light's travelling through water, fabric or air that makes wet things look darker — it's what happens when light changes speed that does the trick. And light changes speed whenever it moves from one refractive index to another. If a beam of light moves from air into fabric, it has to slow down from 300,000 kilometres per hour to 225,000 kilometres per hour instantly. And putting on the brakes like that makes light do the equivalent of an electromagnetic skid. It bends.</p>
<p>Light gets the bends</p>
<p>Why things look darker when wet The bigger the change in refractive index when light moves from one medium to another, the bigger the change in speed, and the bigger the angle that light bends at. So when light passes from air into fabric it bends at a much bigger angle than when it goes from water into fabric. And light doesn't just bend once when it goes from, say, air into fabric. Clothes are made up of fibres and air. Light passing through a t-shirt is going to constantly move in and out of the fibres and the air, and it bends every time it does. Because the refractive indexes of air and cotton are so different, the angle of the bend is pretty big. All those big angles mean that a lot of light ends up bouncing back out of the fabric — and some of it will head straight for your eyes. When your clothes are wet, all those air gaps get filled with water. So when light hits a wet patch it's moving in and out of water and fibres, not air and fibres. The refractive index of fabric is a lot closer to that of water than it is to air, so the light doesn't change speed quite as dramatically going between water and fibres. And that means it bends at a smaller angle when it goes from one to the other.</p>
<p>It's those small angles that are behind the darkness of the wet spot. With small angles, it takes a lot more bends for light to turn right around and head back out to our eyes, so more of the light ends up travelling forward into the fabric. And that patch looks darker.</p>
<p>Spend a few minutes under a hand dryer or sunshine, and you'll see the t-shirt lighten up again. As the water evaporates, air comes back into the water/fibre mix, and brings some bigger angles to the light, so more of it makes it back to our eyes. And we can face the world with crisp dry confidence again</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because of all the super complicated answers here allow me to simplify it into a <em>real</em> ELI5: </p>
<p>Water sitting above a surface, as in a puddle or lake, reflects light off it's surface. But water absorbed into something makes surfaces <em>less</em> reflective. Less reflection equals less light going toward you. Think of it like if a mirror were made out of cloth. If you wet the mirror it will sag and fold over on itself and then you can't see your reflection. Water is scattering the light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
