		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The concepts of particles and waves evolved in classical physics, however as quantum physics was developed, we discovered that those ideas were simply approximations. An electron isn't a particle; it isn't a wave. What is it?</p>
<p>We can understand electrons only in terms of a new construct, something we might call a particle-wave or a wave-particle. It isn't a wave; it isn't a particle; it has some properties of each, however, the mixture is awfully bizarre. It moves through space like a wave; it responds to measurement like a particle; it's a wave that can carry mass and electric charge. It can spread, reflect and cancel itself, just as noise-cancelling headphones cancel sound waves. However, when you detect it, the event is generally sudden, abrupt. The detected electron continues to exist, however, the wave function has been decisively altered. If you detect it with a small instrument, the previously large wave function instantly becomes small.</p>
<p>The ”duality” of wave-particle duality reflects the fact that if you persist in understanding the true nature of the electron in terms of particle and waves, then you have to consider it to be both. However, in reality, it's neither, it's something that is new (if you can apply that word to an over 100 years old idea).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>While that blog post is a <em>bit</em> tangential to your question, it includes the answer. In short, it is not behaving as a particle or a wave, it's behaving as a quantum &quot;thing&quot; with wave-particle duality described by the evolution of its wavefunction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is quite old, so I suspect my answer will stay buried, but...</p>
<p>There are a lot of good answers here that go beyond the &quot;wave/particle duality&quot; model, but I believe you can do a fair bit of justice to the principles of quantum mechanics in this example without ditching that model. Consider three parts to your example; the light going through a double slit, the light travelling through the air, and the light hitting your retina.</p>
<p>First, a brief but important note... Observation in quantum mechanics isn't about a conscious being seeing something -- it's about a quantum system (a few particles or whatever) interacting with one that's very not quantum (a detector, the walls of a box, your dog). Any time that there's a strong interaction with a whole bunch of particles that in turn strongly interact amongst themselves, the whole quantum thing is in a sense broken, and stuff starts behaving classically. That's not a perfect way of seeing things, but it's decent.</p>
<p>As it goes through the slit, then, the light it doesn't really interact strongly with anything -- the light that does interact with the slit doesn't hasn't gone through it, it's hit the barrier to either side. That's what &quot;interacting strongly&quot; would mean. So the light that goes through gets to stay wavey.</p>
<p>As it travels through the air, it again doesn't interact strongly with anything. It's maybe bent gently, but it's not absorbed, for example. It stays wavey.</p>
<p>Then it hits your eye. There, it *is* absorbed. It interacts very strongly with the particles in your retina, behaving more like a particle and exciting the electrons somewhere from one energy level to another. It sets off a sequence of events that changes all kinds of macroscopic stuff, ending in an unimaginably large number of particles being affected as you &quot;see something&quot;.</p>
<p>To answer your question, then, the light kept behaving like a wave &quot;out there&quot; because out there, it wasn't interacting strongly with anything. When it hit your retina, *then* it interacted strongly with something and started behaving a bunch more like a particle.</p>
<p>You could change that, of course, and the standard &quot;Young's double slit experiment&quot; showed that if you somehow detect the light as it travels through the slit, it no longer behaves like a wave there. But, of course, that's what we'd expect, because being detected is again this cascade of events that changes the macroscopic world, forcing the light to behave like a particle as it travels through the slit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;particles when observed, waves when not&quot; is a bit of an over simplification. </p>
<p>I prefer the term stochastic wave to describe electrons. </p>
<p>To understand stochastic:
Imagine a machine gun shooting a target. It will have some sort of spread on the target. The shots got the target one by one (stochasticly), but eventually you can work out a probably for it hitting each spot. This gives you a probability distribution. </p>
<p>To get the wave part:
Imagine a wave hitting a shoreline. It hits with different amount of force at different places. You can graph this force to get a function. Note it hits everywhere in the function an the same time (so not stochastic) </p>
<p>Waves and probably distributions behave differently. For example waves interfere while probably distributions don't. </p>
<p>Now for electrons, electrons behave stochasticly, creating a probably distribution. Except the probability distribution follows the rules of waves instead of the rules that govern classical probability distributions. </p>
<p>Thus the term, stochastic wave. </p>
<p>You typically get good results in QM if you treat the electron as a wave for all of your calculations until the end where whatever you're measuring results in a stochastic probability distribution. This is where the &quot;wave if not observed, particles if observed&quot; oversimplification comes from.</p>
<p>Then to make things more complicated, there is wave function collapse that messes up attempts to probe deeper into the probability distribution vs wave nature when you try to probe mid experiment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The concept that unifies particles and waves is that of the <em>field</em>.  A field can be wave-shaped or particle-shaped (concentrated in a small region).  Depending on how your instrument interacts with the field, either form gets amplified and macroscopically manifest.  The uncertainty principle is a universal property of fields (even classical ones).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
