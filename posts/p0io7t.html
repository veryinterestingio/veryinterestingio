This is called “peer review”.  If you keep publishing papers that everyone else mocks, then the university figures out you aren’t a very good theoretical physicist, and they fire you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that universities don't have managers that micromanage professors and their research. They don't really care for the short-term output, as meaningful research takes place on the order of weeks to months, even for a theorist. Practically speaking, profs are also typically well-motivated to produce results; for universities, these results are in the form of things like grant funding, which require publications to get. So if the prof does their work, they get publications out, and the university eventually sees that as funding, prestige, etc. </p>
<p>There are times in which profs do end up coasting, and the university won't really catch a whiff of that until they run out of funding and/or get graduate student complaints.</p>
<p>Finally, profs also do (typically) have some administrative or teaching responsibility, in which they do have harder set deadlines for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
