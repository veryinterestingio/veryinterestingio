<p>Now, it's an acapella parody of despacito so you might not think I'm serious, but it basically lays out the basics for everything regarding the molecular, genetic, embryological and evolutionary reasons we look like we do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok so I am an undergrad embryology TA and it isnt hormones that causes things to develop into there proper shape but it's a combination of things called signaling factors like bmp, wnt, sonic hedge hog, fgf, veg f and then something called hox genes. So like for the hand there is something called the apical external ridge which starts at the stump and secretes these signaling factors causing it to grow out. Once it has grown out it secretes sonic hedge hog (shh) and wherever the most shh is present becomes the thumb and wherever the cells in the area see the least or no shh becomes the pinky. In your case the ear comes from a developmental section of the embryo called a pharyngeal arch or also a branchial arch. Off the top of my head I cant remember which arch it is or which signaling factors (sorry, I'm on vacation right now) but some combo of factors will tell the cells to grow out and around and into the shape that evolution has given to us.</p>
<p>The tru eli5: everywhere there is an outgrowth on your body (arms, legs) starts with a group of cells that act as a boss or signaling center. Signaling center printer goes brrrr and prints a butt ton of signaling factors that touch the cells around and tells them how to grow. These cells listen to not just the type of factor but also how much of it is present as a signal to their specific job.</p>
<p>Edit: I would just like to add that I encourage you to look some of these up. Like with the hand thing there have been some cool experiments on mice where they add shh to the wrong side and basically put their hand on backwards and they've also given the mouse the equivalent of all thumbs. That's how they figured this out is messing around with what works and where.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different parts of your body are made of many many many cells. When you’re in mommy’s tummy before you’re born, cells are created and put together like legos. But the new cells don’t have a purpose yet. They’re called stem cells because they don’t have a specific job. But then they get a new job like (heart, ear, arm) and they do different things depending on what body part they are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
