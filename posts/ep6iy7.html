		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A chemical called <a href="https://www.yourhormones.info/hormones/ghrelin/" target="_blank">Ghrelin</a> signals to your body that food time is coming up, and that's what makes you feel hungry.</p>
<p>If your eating routine is all over the place, then the ghrelin won't know the correct time to signal, so it will make you feel hungry more often than it should.</p>
<p>When you routinely have large gaps between meals, e.g one meal a day at around 23 hour fasted time, your body will  adjust to the new food routine after a continued time on it and you wont feel hungry until your new eating window is near.</p>
<p>If you eat 3 meals a day  (7am,12pm, 6pm) then your body, using ghrelin, will tell you that its time to eat at around 6:45am, 11:45am, 5:45pm. If you decide to start fasting and change your eating to 2 meals at 2pm &amp; 7pm, then your body will still be telling you that the original times are food times, so you'll continue to feel hungry around those times, but as your body gets used to the new routine it will start making you hungry around the new times.</p>
<p>Youtuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APZCfmgzoS0" target="_blank">What I've Learned</a> has a great video on the science of fasting vs eating less</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When your blood sugar drops (such as after not eating for a while, or when waking up) your body releases a hormone called <em>Cortisol</em>.</p>
<p>This is a stress hormone that in turn causes the release of <em>Epinephrine</em> and <em>Norepinephrine</em>, who are more commonly known as Adrenaline/Noradrenaline.</p>
<p>The function of these in this context consists of several parts;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They tell the liver to break down Glucagon, releasing sugar into the blood (Thereby decreasing appetite and food cravings).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They tell the brain that it isn't actually hungry, therefore the hunger pains remain but you quickly feel nauseated when eating.</p>
</li>
<li>They cause dry mouth making food taste less appetizing than otherwise, and making it harder to consume it.</li>
</ol>
<p>EDIT: Cortisol naturally peaks around 8-9 AM and then decreases until ~5AM, providing a logical explanation for why it's hard to eat especially in the mornings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>another way around this (which is also more beneficial to health is small snacks through the day, nuts, jerky dried fruit. small portions but with good calories to fill you up and you don't feel like you're starving in the night.
At least that's how I battled the issue. And still do today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
