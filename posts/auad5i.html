		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am by no means an expert on this so you are probably better off googling or watching YouTube on the matter.</p>
<p>But with that said heat plays a big role in the formation of thunder storms. My understanding is that thunder storms form when very moist air is forced high up into the atmosphere where it collides with cooler air. The vast amount of moisture allows for these big clouds to be form and during the formation the clouds are charged with tremendous amounta of electricity which leads to lightning strikes.</p>
<p>During summer and especially warm summer days a lot of water evaporates from the ocean and rise along with the warm air high up in the atmosphere. In winter not as much water evaporates and it does not rise as high up due to the lower air temperature. You don't have these warm and cold air collisions in winter either since the air is colder to begin with and it doesn't rise so far up.</p>
<p>Edit:
As for why they are more common in the evening is that it takes time for the clouds to form but also beacuse colder air is being drawn in towards the warmer areas. Since warm air rises you get an area of lower air pressure. This means that air from surrounding areas are drawn in, this is actually what creates wind, air moving from a high pressure (cold area) into a low pressure (warm area). So if you have a long warm day a lot of air will rise into the atmosphere and create a low pressure. In the evening as temperatures start to drop more and more air will be sucked in and thus creating these warm and cold collisions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you live in Lake Effect Snow country like Western New York, there's plenty of what's called Thundersnow.  </p>
<p>The difference in air temperatures between the warmer waters of the lake and the cold arctic air blowing in creates a powerful convective engine that pulls a lot of moisture out of the lake waters into the cold air mass.  That convection makes for some pretty cool thunderstorms in the middle of heavy snowfall.  </p>
<p>You need to be within a couple miles of the storm cells to hear the thunder however - the snow serves as an acoustic dampener but the lightning can be seen as greenish flashes in the clouds. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, the bigger the difference in energy levels across a system, the more violently and powerfully that system will behave as it comes to equilibrium. In the case of most phenomena that are driven by heat (which includes storms), that means looking at the difference in temperature across the system.</p>
<p>In the summer, you have lots of moist, warm air mixing with cool, dry air, so there's a big difference in potential energies, and so a lot of really violent phenomena as that immense amount of energy tries to equilibriate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the winter, you have cool, dry air mixing with slightly less cool moist air. There's less of an energy difference, so the resolution is more &quot;gentle,&quot; for lack of a better word.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually did a science experiment on this back in middle school like 35 years ago lol not the actual thunder just the storms but it involved putting 4 100w light bulb in the top of a plywood box then down the length of the box were 4 glass panes that could slide back and forth in a track and in the bottom of the box was a pan of water. The heat from the lightbulbs causes the water to evaporate and it's drawn up to the top of the box due to the heat. Then you slide the glass panes allowing cold air in which forces the hot air/moisture to move away (I could be wrong but I think this is what creates the static that actually causes the lightning) anyway you could actually create a hurricane in the box by aligning the glass panels correctly, it was a pretty neat science experiment. If only it could have generated lightning that would have been amazing lol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All things have a charge.  Lightning is generally related to charged dust getting kicked up into the atmosphere by wind and then as they all mix and collide the charges sometimes get to certain intensities where it splits the air and then uses the properties of that split air to arc to ground (or to an opposite charge to negate each other from cloud to cloud).  So the more dust in the air the more likely it is of happening.  This is similar to how a tesla coil works.</p>
<p>End of a hot day would mean that there is a high temperature difference between the morning and evening temps which would cause wind to pick up.  Hot air creates pressure voids that more dense cold air likes to fill.  This wind would kick more dry dust up into the air causing dry lightning.  There are more factors at play, but that is the pure electrical aspect.</p>
