		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actual files (pretty much excel files) are transferred between banks and even though most parts of that process is automated there are still manual components to it. There are also other issues that need to be processed (flagged accounts receiving large sums for example.) And people don’t typically work during the weekends in finance.</p>
<p>Beyond this you should know that legacy banks has legacy systems (think DOS) that they should replace but so much is built upon this ancient tech that a process like that would require boatload of investments from most banks at once and... don’t fix what ain’t broken.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even though the order processing is done by computers, most of the 'picking' and packing, even in large Amazon warehouses, is done by hand.  Plus, shipping companies still charge a premium for weekend pickup and delivery. So unless you pay for something above and beyond the free/basic shipping, your Friday night order won't go out until Monday anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even though most of everything is automated, there is still an amount of human touch that goes into every transaction. Packages have to be hand sorted, hand packed and picked up by a human, mailed through the system and delivered by a person. </p>
<p>Banks make money on &quot;the float&quot; this is the time when money comes into the bank (say Friday at 5pm) and doesn't leave the bank until Monday at 5pm, because the &quot;bank wasn't open.&quot; Yes, the computer got the money and knows what to do with it, BUT...the bank, by holding th money for a weekend may have made .0000000001 on the money in that time. Now multiply that by billions of transactions and over the course of the life  of the bank, you just made the bank some very serious coin.</p>
<p>Also, there is a bit of human oversight that goes into the most automated of systems. computers crash. They miss stuff, they can botch stuff. there are human error corrections that can resolve something before it goes out into the wild. Those business days help with that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This thread is full of justifications about why banking transfers can't be any other way, but <a href="https://www.swift.com/sites/default/files/documents/swift_payments_whitepaper_realtimepayments.pdf" target="_blank">other countries have already figured this out</a>, and more are working on it. People are also pushing for it in the US, perhaps most famously <a href="https://medium.com/@teamwarren/end-wall-streets-stranglehold-on-our-economy-70cf038bac76" target="_blank">Elizabeth Warren</a>.</p>
<p>This is how it always goes in the US: if you ask a question about why any system is the way it is, we will reflexively respond with uninformed yet vehement off-the-cuff arguments that change is impossible and the current system is the best we could ever realistically hope for. This happens with healthcare, education, criminal justice, immigration, race issues, and more. I hope we can find a way to move past that and learn from other countries once in a while.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The biggest reason is that there is an electronic payment system between banks known as the &quot;Fedwire&quot; which is operated by the Federal Reserve and is only open on business days.  All banks are required by law to be open on all business days (weekdays which are not federal bank holidays).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
