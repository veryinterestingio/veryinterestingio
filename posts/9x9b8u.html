		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My friend has gotten really into conspiracy theories lately, and he has started to believe that there was a highly advanced civilization on earth, like as highly advanced as ours, more than 13k years ago, but supposedly since a meteor or some other event happened and wiped most humans out, we started over, and the only reason we know about some history sites with stone buildings, but no old sites of metal buildings or electronics is because those would have all decomposed while the stone structures wouldn't decompose</p>
<p>I keep telling him even if the metal mostly decomposed, we should still have some sort of evidence of really old scrap metal or something right?</p>
<p>Edit: So just to clear up the problem that people think I might have had conclusions of what an advanced civilization was since people are saying that &quot;Highly advanced civilization (as advanced as ours) doesn't mean they had to have metal buildings/electronics. <em>They could have advanced in their own ways!</em>&quot; The metal buildings/electronics was something that my friend brought up himself.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Look into glass. Even if all the metal magically vanished, glass would remain. Take a common glass object like a Coke bottle and leave it exposed in the woods. It will take roughly a million years before you can't tell it was made by Coke. We have none of that evidence anywhere in the world. If you buried it in a desert cave, it could take tens of millions of years or more. We also have satellites that are so far out in orbit that their orbits will not decay. But we don't see any dead satellites in orbit that we didn't put there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there would be evidence—if the civilization existed in the past couple million years. Beyond that, harder to say. Professor Adam Frank (Univeristy of Rochester) and Gavin Schmidt (director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies) suggest that a “short-lived” civilization of 100,000 years would be “easy to miss” using our current methods if it rose and fell before the Paleocene Epoch. </p>
<p>Not that they think there is evidence that such a civilization actually existed. For one, it would necessarily have been a non-human civilization. And it would almost certainly leave some sort of record on a planetary scale, even if it’s not something we’re looking for. But in any case, we certainly wouldn’t find any artifacts from such a civilization. </p>
<p>So might it be possible that an advanced civilization of say, reptile “people” existed 70 million years ago? Yes, but do we have any reason to believe it’s true? No. Frank and Schmidt’s work focuses on the effects our current civilization will have and what we can do to make our own civilization more sustainable. </p>
<p>Summary of Frank and Schmidt’s thought experiment and conclusions in the Atlantic <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/are-we-earths-only-civilization/557180/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Better still, even if we didn't recover a single metal artifact, we'd still have dated evidence of metal smelting in lake sediments. I refer you to the example of the metal smelting record in the Andes, where centuries of sporadic on and off metal working is recorded layer by layer in the lacustrine sedimentary record. </p>
<p>These records document the use of metal smelting through the rise and collapse of three civilisations (the Wari, the Inca and the colonial spaniards). The information is detailed, allowing to pinpoint evolving changes in technology and also ore sourcing. The existence of a metal using civilization 13 000 years ago would be blatantly obvious, and our study of such recent strata would have noticed them by now. Better still, each individual layer corresponds to a yearly cycle and can be precisely dated by counting backward. As it stands, the oldest evidence we have for metal use is a <a href="https://search.proquest.com/openview/197f74475447de4e84e8327acdff33cd/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=40505" target="_blank">7000 year old copper awl found in Israel</a>.</p>
<p>see:</p>
<p><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/es062930+" target="_blank">Cooke, Colin A., et al. &quot;A millennium of metallurgy recorded by lake sediments from Morococha, Peruvian Andes.&quot; Environmental science &amp; technology 41.10 (2007): 3469-3474.</a></p>
<p>As to convincing your friend, I am increasingly of the opinion that belief in conspiracy theories is akin to a mental condition. Studies have shown that <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00206/full" target="_blank">such people may have a peculiar schizotypic mindset marked by delusional ideation</a>. Facts won't convince your friend, they might even reinforce his abnormal world view. He might need help. Perhaps a more fruitfull approach would be to inquire what brings him to entertain such notions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03748" target="_blank">Silurian hypothesis</a>, the name of which is based of of the Dr. Who episode, ended up being a useful thought experiment for future extraterrestrial exploration. Would we be able to detect evidence of an alien civilization that died out a million years prior?</p>
<p>Really fascinating read.</p>
<p>As to your friend's belief, it is incorrect. It is very, very, very unlikely that an industrialized civilization existed prior to us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
