		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all you're comparing a 55-year-old racing prototype to brand new road cars. The Ford GT40 was made to go as fast as it could, reliably enough to win a 24-hour race; a modern 'supercar' is designed to look pretty, be comfortable, meet government safety regulations, etc. reliably for years. A more apt comparison is between the GT40 and a new Le Mans prototype.</p>
<p>Compared to a modern Le Mans prototype it was more advantageous for the GT40 to be as fast on the Mulsanne Straight as it possibly could. The course at Le Mans now has chicanes deliberately added to the straight, to force drivers to slow down. There's only so much space to reach top speed now, so carrying as much speed through corners and accelerating as quickly as possible is more advantageous.</p>
<p>Last year's Le Mans winner, the Toyota TS050, had a top speed of 217.5 mph, which isn't all that much more than the GT40. However, it reached that top speed in much shorter straights and can corner much quicker than the GT40 ever could. Dan Gurney set the fastest lap in '66, at 3:30. Last year's fastest lap was 3:17, with two chicanes in the Mulsanne Straight. Overall the TS050 is <strong>much</strong> faster.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know where you get the &quot;barely pushing 200&quot; from.</p>
<p>1993 McLaren F1 - 240.1mph. ...</p>
<p>2005 Bugatti Veyron - 253mph. ...</p>
<p>2007 Shelby Supercars Ultimate Aero - 256.18mph. ...</p>
<p>2010 Bugatti Veyron Super Sport - 267.857mph. ...</p>
<p>2014 Hennessey Venom GT - 270.49mph. ...</p>
<p>2017 Koenigsegg Agera RS - 277.87mph. ...</p>
<p>2019 Bugatti Chiron - 304.77mph.</p>
<p>Plus as others have said, these are production cars. The GT40 was a purpose built race car. Modern NASCAR race cars are purpose built to do 210ish mph on the top end and average about 180 mph for 500 miles(depending on the track.) Lemans cars average around 150 mph over the course of the race. Funny cars and dragsters are purpose built and regularly hit 330+ mph in under 4 seconds. By comparison the 2017 Bugatti Chiron took 32.6 seconds to reach 249 mph.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not that they can't. We have Hennessy making road cars that can hit 270. A lot of factors and a certain degree of risk/reward comes into play when you're going that fast. It's not worth it for a lot of manufacturers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A modern supercar is quite different from a race car. </p>
<p>race cars are spartan, lightweight, have no emissions (to speak of), and are designed to go very very fast. Also, most of them will kill anyone who's stupid. </p>
<p>The 1964 GT40 was technically a prototype car. Yes, there were several, but they were all hand built, hand tested, hand tuned and driven by very talented pilots. </p>
<p>supercars are <em>production</em> vehicles - they're designed for the roads you and I drive on. top speed of a supercar isn't really relevant - and if you're gonna take one to the track, then you're probably rich enough to afford the modifications necessary for it to compete on the track. </p>
<p>If you look at even modern day 24h Lemans races, you'll note that any of the production cars there are not what you'd see on the showroom floor. They're purpose built race cars (for example, the Corvette C7 R and C8 R)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
