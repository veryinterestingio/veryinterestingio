		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly enough this has already happened once. </p>
<p>Once upon a time when the universe was about 2 Billion years younger, the ratio of natural Uranium in its relevant isotopes U238/235 was high enough that it would have counted as &quot;enriched&quot;, eg. about 3.5% of U235. Thus is was able to support fission chain reactions, which in a specific area in Africa (Oklo) occured in natural reactors for a time of about 500.000 years.</p>
<p>These were water moderated - water would flow in, fission occured. The water got hot, evaporated, which turned the reactor off. Once it was cool enough again, water would flow in again and start the cycle anew. </p>
<p>Naturally occuring reactors are no no longer possible in the solar system, too much of the U235 has decayed. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>U^235 nuclear fuel has a half-life of 703,800,000 years if it's not part of a reaction.</p>
<p>Pu^239 nuclear fuel has a half-life of 24,100 years if not part of a reaction.</p>
<p>Part of being nuclear weapon fuel is that it can't have much spontaneous decay.  Because that can start a premature detonation- &quot;nuclear fizzle&quot;- in the microsecond before optimum density is achieved.  </p>
<p>Both these are so slow they're virtually non-radioactive.  Plutonium is especially toxic, however, chemically.  Uranium too.</p>
<p>Thermonuclear &quot;hydrogen bomb&quot; weapons which use tritium (hydrogen isotope) <em>fusion</em> fuel have to deal with its 12 yr half-life.  In these designs, fusion is not actually a significant part of the energy- it's there to force a more through % of fission in the uranium/plutonium fuel, which increases the possible size of the explosion, also reduces the mass of uranium/plutonium fuel needed.</p>
<p>Now in many designs, lithium-6 deuteride is used to generate tritium during the detonation.  However, AFAIK some tritium is still needed to initiate this reaction.  </p>
<p>All tritium is produced by lithium-6 bombardment in a special reactor, not related to nuclear power reactors.  It does not &quot;keep&quot; due to its 12 yr half-life and refrigeration does nothing to preserve it.</p>
<p>Bottom line, thermonuclear hydrogen bombs DO need replacement of tritium every few years.</p>
<p>Tritium is not integrated into the weapon AFAIK, whether it's part of the fuel or just an initiator, it's pumped in during the priming process from an external container.   </p>
<p>All modern nuclear weapons are that thermonuclear &quot;h-bomb&quot; type and require tritium.</p>
<p>Now the 12 yr half-life doesn't mean it's useless at 12 years.  It becomes diluted with new helium as the tritium decays.  Details on how enriched the tritium must be is very classified.  If the weapon still works at 12.5% tritium, that's 36 yrs after mfg.  If you had something in the storage container that adsorbed helium into a solid, the gas will always be 100% tritium, just losing more and more mass over the years.  In theory you could start with a large overkill of tritium in storage and still have enough left after a very long period to prime the weapon.</p>
<p>Or, more likely, you'd have tritium (hydrogen) bonded into a solid/liquid such as iron hydride, as it decays the helium will always be an unbonded gas, which you could simply vent over time.  During priming you shut the vent, chemically force the iron hydride to release the tritium-hydrogen, and have high-purity tritium gas despite being after many half-lives.</p>
<p>Outside of that, we worry about general decay of the tech.  Plastic explosives are used to compress the core have  a limited shelf life.  Electronics don't last forever even if unpowered.  A battery is essential to power the electronics.  A non-rechargeable lithium battery would last for like 10+ years, some dry-storage batteries that you have to mechanically mix the electrolyte into could in theory be dry-stored for hundred of years.</p>
<p>Bottom line, if you're considering a fictional post-apocalyptic discovery of a long-abandoned nuclear weapon, it will probably not be usable due to loss of tritium.  Even the above &quot;iron hydride&quot; scheme would be a problem after 120 years=12x half-lives= 0.10% of the original tritium mass remains.  Even if tritium was not a problem, the battery and plastic explosive would also be big problems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A nuclear weapon, for our purposes, is the fuel (uranium-235/plutonium-239/lithium-deuteride), the high explosives that sets off the fission reaction, the electrical components that make the whole thing work, and often lots of other little material components that make the whole thing work (esp. in thermonuclear weapons — e.g., &quot;interstage&quot; material that guides energy from the primary to the secondary).</p>
<p>What does time do this equation? Under just &quot;normal&quot; circumstances, you would expect some possible issues, e.g., the high explosives can subtly degrade over time and need to be monitored or replaced. This is just the kind of stuff that happens with substances in the world. </p>
<p>What's trickier is the fact that some of those components, notably the Pu-239 parts, are radioactive. They are sending out little bits of ionizing radiation all the time. Not huge amounts (enough that Pu-239 is warm to the touch, though). But over time, that ionizing radiation will also change the chemical structure of things — that's what &quot;ionizing&quot; means, really (it strips electrons, which changes chemistry). </p>
<p>So this increases the uncertainty about how these weapons will react over time. The high explosives might degrade faster than they would otherwise, and the fuel is &quot;self-irradiating&quot; and thus changing its own composition in subtle but important ways. </p>
<p>There are also some components that require routine replacement. Small amounts (e.g. gram amounts) of tritium gas are used for &quot;boosting&quot; the fission primaries. Tritium has a pretty short half-life so its gas reservoirs need to be &quot;refreshed&quot; every few months. If you had a random nuclear bomb and didn't refresh its tritium, it would definitely be less powerful if you tried to set it off later.</p>
<p>For the other changes, the US Stockpile Stewardship program is set up to monitor and predict these changes, and replace the weapon components (including the fuel) on a regular schedule. </p>
<p>But if you are imagining some kind of <em>Beneath the Planet of the Apes</em> situation where a warhead, unmaintained, was being detonated centuries later, the odds that it would not work at full yield would increase over time. It isn't a sure thing, but the amount of uncertainty that would enter the equation would increase as time went on. Would it get to the point that it would eventually not have much of a nuclear yield at all (a &quot;fizzle&quot;)? Potentially, though I have seen nothing hard and fast about the predicted rates of decay for, say, the high explosives and their effects on the final detonation yield — so it's hard to say for sure given the data that is public. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As pointed out in other comments, the isotopes take a LONG time to be &quot;no longer viable&quot; but the components themselves need maintained fairly regularly. In the US, the Dept. of Energy is in charge of the stewardship of these weapons, and they are [relatively] regularly disassembled, fixed/modified/upgraded/etc., the cores maintained/refined, and then re-assembled. Different facilities/laboratories are generally responsible for different parts of the process, I.e. Los Alamos National Lab handles one part, Oakridge National Lab does another, Lawrence Livermore National Lab does another, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
