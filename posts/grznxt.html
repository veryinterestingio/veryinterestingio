<p>Which is why you'll see trees of the same species and location leaf out and drop leaves at different times. Though in the same location the spread is rarely more than a couple of weeks, because those were the strong that survived and out competed their earlier or later siblings.</p>
<p>In sweden there's an experiment where birch seeds were collected from all of Sweden and planted along a street in the farming university in Uppsala. The spread from the south to the north is huge. The ones from the far north only have leaves for like 2-3 months.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plants are given a lot of signals that can indicate to them that they need to begin going dormant. Air and soil temperatures as well the ratio of daylight hours to nighttime hours are their biggest indicators. A deciduous tree will begin cutting off chlorophyll to the leaves based on these to preserve resources (specifically nitrogen because of how vital it is in photosynthesis) during less productive or potentially damaging months. Many deciduous trees will also begin changing levels of auxin and ethylene, which triggers leaf drop. In short, a moved tree would still lose its leaves. </p>
<p>There's still a good chance the tree might die though. The shock of transport, the abrupt changes in climate that it did not grow to accommodate, the swift change soil types. The list of things that could go wrong is long.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the tree.</p>
<p>USDA publishes information about &quot;plant hardiness zones.&quot; These zones primarily give you information about the average dates of last frost in the spring, first frost in the fall, and the growing season between those two dates. They also correlate somewhat with the absolute low winter temperature expected.</p>
<p>I live right on the border of zones 5 and 6. I have a Golden Raintree which is not recommended for areas north of zone 5. Why? Because the timing of it leafing out is based on the length of day, and if planted too far north, it's tender young leaves will get nipped and killed by frost IF there is a late frost.</p>
<p>This year, we had an early April morning low temp of 22F, and a late April low of 28F. Both frosts completely killed the emerging leaves on my Golden Raintree, and I feared the tree would be killed - but it's leafing out OK now. There is significant damage to the tree - virtually every branch has a few inches of dead tissue that I will need to trim away.</p>
<p>Some trees also have a lower limit for survival in terms of absolute cold. Where I live winters can go below 0F. In 2014 it went to -15F. Lots of southern species of trees simply cannot survive these temperatures. Around here some people try to grow Mimosa trees (USDA zones 6 - 10), but about every 5 to 15 years we'll get a freeze so low that it kills the tops of the Mimosas. They come back from the roots but then you have a very odd shaped, multi-trunked shrubby tree.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would depend on the tree species but here we assume it is at least deciduous. </p>
<p>Anyhow, plants in general can confer &quot;phenotypic plasticity&quot;, which is a fancy way of saying they can express multiple traits (e.g timing of when to produce leaves) with the same underlying genetics because of a change in the environment. </p>
<p>If the tree survives the transplant (e.g doesn't get stressed from a change in soil conditions and climate), it would then depend upon how well the tree can detect environmental cues such as cold or frost.</p>
<p>Typically tree populations that live in more stable climates (e.g closer to the equator and less seasonality) will undergo natural selection via multiple long generations to favor genotypes that have confer highest fitness (survival and reproduction). A multi decade tree in Florida will likely have a genotype that is selected for Florida weather and climate (less seasonality) and it is possible that it may have lost it's underlying genetics that would allow detection of environmental cues to permit survival in more seasonal climates. </p>
<p>That being said, natural selection in trees is a long process (because life span) compared to plants and it is more likely that the tree still has the underlying genetics to allow for environmental cue detection. I'd suspect that the tree would be able to survive in it's new conditions IF you would find other trees of the same species in the same area. </p>
<p>In essence, if we're talking about trees with a broad geographical range like Oaks, yes it will survive. If we're talking about orange trees, no.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Only if they’re deciduous, meaning they lose their leaves in the fall. This occurs in areas that experience drastic changes in their seasons. As fall approaches, the loss of sunlight hours triggers a natural production of a hormone called Abscisic acid that prevents new growth. During the winter, abscisic acid is broken down by temperatures between 35 and 42 degrees F. Each plant produces just the right amount of this hormone to survive the winter and flower in spring. </p>
<p>So to answer your question, a deciduous tree would lose its leaves on time, however, since Florida experiences a much shorter winter than up north, the plant would come out of dormancy in the dead of winter and likely die. However, most plants in Florida are subtropic. They don’t typically lose their leaves to begin with, allowing the frost to kill the leaves, killing the plant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
