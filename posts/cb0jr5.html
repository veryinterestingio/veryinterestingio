		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Arguably the main purpose of urination is to get rid of excess nitrogen-based chemicals (e.g. ammonia, urea, or uric acid depending on the organism).  These chemicals can be quite dangerous to most forms of life in high concentration, so it's true that if they were to build up in oceans this would cause problems.  Fortunately though, there is a well established <a href="https://worldoceanreview.com/en/files/2017/12/wor5_k2a_abb_2-10_x_en.png" target="_blank">nitrogen cycle</a> in which various bacteria and other organisms convert ammonia to gaseous dinitrogen (N2), which is relatively harmless but also unusable by most living things.  From there, other microorganisms carry out nitrogen fixation, converting dinitrogen back into other forms that can be used in building various molecules that are important to life, and the cycle continues.  <a href="http://cmore.soest.hawaii.edu/cruises/biolincs/nitrogen.htm" target="_blank">This website</a> provides some more detailed information if you're interested.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The solution to pollution is dilution.  </p>
<p>The total volume of the ocean is <a href="https://www.livescience.com/6470-ocean-depth-volume-revealed.html" target="_blank">1.35 billion <strong>cubic kilometers.</strong></a> </p>
<p>Scientists estimate that there are <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/how-many-fish-are-there-in-the-ocean.html" target="_blank">3.5 trillion fish in the sea</a> which means that each fish has 0.0003 cubic kilometers all to themselves to pee in (well, not really but you get the idea) which equates to 300,000 cubic meters or 7.93 x 10^7 gallons. </p>
<p>To give a picture of how much water 300,000 cubic meters is, an olympic sized swimming pool is only 2,500 cubic meters, so each fish gets more than 100 swimming pools to pee in!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yeah... the Ocean is HUGE.  Like REALLY REALLY HUGE.  With over 1.3 BILLION cubic kilometers, it's pretty easy to conceive vast expanses of completely empty ocean.</p>
<p>To put it in perspective: if we condensed the entire population of humans on Earth into a single space, even granting each person a square yard to stand in, we'd only take up about the area of the state of Vermont.  And the ocean is WAY bigger than just the land surface on earth, being home to about 99% of the habitable living space on Earth.</p>
<p>And sure, the ocean is home to a much larger number of actual organisms.  However, the vast majority of them are much smaller than humans (most fish, invertebrates, crustaceans and shellfish, and the plankton/microorganisms.)</p>
<p>Another way to look at it is this:</p>
<p>If we ignore that some species live on land, and other species live in the ocean, and just lump all living things on earth together, there's roughly 75 billion tons of total biomass.  That's ALL living things (people, fish, birds, trees, bacteria, flies, flowers, etc.)</p>
<p>The ocean contains approximately 1,450,000,000,000,000,000 tons of ocean water.  That's not 1.4 billion, or trillion, or quadrillion... but Quintillion.  1.45 Quintillion tons.  That's 1,450,000,000 billion.  That's so many orders of magnitute greater, that the amount of pee present is, to coin a phrase, &quot;A drop in the ocean&quot;.</p>
