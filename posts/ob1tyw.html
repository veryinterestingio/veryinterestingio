		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For example, sudden heart failure (eg gunshot to the heart, heart attack*) is often depicted as instant death, but there would still be oxygenated blood in most tissues until the cells use it up and no more O2 comes in cuz the heart isn't pumping. Does consciousness linger for a few seconds? Do we know? </p>
<p>*Obvi not all heart attacks cuz defibrillators. Let's not go into the cases where people are clinically dead but then resuscitated, although that is wild to think about. My fave is reviving people who have fallen into cold water.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We do have a reflex which is triggered on a number of different indications of serious traumatic damage which makes us unconscious. This reflex goes as fast as the nerves can send the signal. We can actually ask people who have experienced this reflex but survived and it turns out they do not remember anything for at least three seconds before they fell unconscious. This is because our permanent memory does lag a bit behind our consciousness but this too gets shut down. There are some neural activity in the form of automatic reflexes but no voulantery movement or feelings. So it is indeed instantaneous. Depending on how you define consciousness it may even happen before any actual damage to the body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I once attended a forensics class and we learned that if your heart stopps or your neck arteries(/veins) are blocked(when you are being strangled), there is some kind of timeline of what happens. About 7 seconds in you will be unconscious, after 2-3 minutes your brain cells will start to die, after about 7 minutes so much of your brain is dead that you won't be able to wake up again.</p>
<p>If your brain receives a lot of pain at once(e.g. getting shot in your heart), you will be unconscious almost immediately (safety reflex). So if you are shot in your heart and die, your body is not dead at the spot, but your conscious self kind of is. (EDIT: see top comment for a better explanation)</p>
<p>Thats why when performing CPR, time is so valuable. If CPR is started 3 minutes late, the patient might still survive but some parts of his brain might already have died. Brain damage can result in loss of memory and so on.</p>
<p>&quot;Fun&quot; fact about being strangled: It's not like in movies/video games where after strangling the victim stays unconscious. The victim will fall unconscious after a few seconds of strangling, but if the attacker stops strangling a minute later, the victim will just wake up again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dramatic blood pressure drops will make a person unconscious. If the disconnect between the heart and brain is large enough (like severe damage to the heart or sliced neck arteries) the person goes unconscious before they might be declared officially dead…. But the time between the two would be maybe a few seconds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the situation.  In the case of things like massive trauma (e.g. explosions), you’re literally dead before you can feel it.  Nerve signals travel, at max, 200 mph, the impulse from a C5 detonation moves at <strong><em>18,000 mph</em></strong>.  Hence the saying, they were dead before they knew it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
