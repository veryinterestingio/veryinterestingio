		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the event that society was to collapse people would likely do exactly what the worlds first civilizations did for currency, find something rare but not too rare as to be impratical, durable so it won't breat down overtime. And preferably shiny ((no idea why on that last part) and gold and silver are some of the two best materials that fit that criteria and is why almost all civilizations used gold and silver as currency </p>
<p>Something like bullets or food like you see in many apoc settings are honestly to easy to produce and acquire to be a proper currency, anyone with the tools to produce bullets in mass or a good harvest would cause chaos to the economy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Predicting what will happen in the event of society’s collapse is like predicting what order a deck of cards will have after you shuffle. You can theorise all you want but there’s no way to make any kind of accurate prediction.</p>
<p>That being said, one reason precious metals are good candidates is that they are rare... you can’t just go and start printing more or harvesting in a large enough scale, so it’s intrinsic value is extremely stable as a symbol of social status as its ubiquity across thousands of years, rise and fall of different empires across extremely different cultures has shown.</p>
<p>Just being of practical value is not a good measure for being a good candidate for world-wide currency. Look at air: the thing of the highest practical value I can think of, and it’s still free. Water: the second most valuable and still almost free except in Africa.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a predictive viewpoint it's basically because historically, they've kept their relative value really well over the course of hundreds/thousands of years.</p>
<p>Someone did a thing where they looked back over prices like the cost of a custom tailored suit in Victorian England or a hotel room and dinner in ancient Rome and so on, and compared that stuff to like a custom-tailored suit today or a nice hotel and restaurant dinner, and the prices in terms of gold/silver matched up surprisingly well.  (Of course that kinda thing could be gamed by comparing low-budget stuff to high-end stuff or whatever, so take it with a grain of salt.)</p>
<p>There's also been a lot of speculation in recent times, which can pretty wildly affect the values, especially when you add in things like funds that promise they'll someday own the metals although they don't yet, or whatever.</p>
<p>Generally though, it's just that they seem to have pretty much always tracked the economy, even since long before there were economists, even through the collapse of nations and empires.  Even through nations going off the gold standard to fiat currency.  There's no real reason why they wouldn't continue to do so.</p>
<p>You ask why not something of more practical value, but they've had practical value as a currency or store of wealth for thousands of years, while most other things from then have rotted, decayed, or collapsed.</p>
<p>That said, they don't really gain value or give returns like the stock market, except in brief speculative bubbles.  They just more or less keep up with inflation, give or take a bit.  But unlike anything else, they've continued doing it for thousands of years worldwide.  So it makes sense to predict that they'd be likely to keep doing so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To put it simply, there's two different properties you want out of an collapse &quot;currency&quot;: People should want and it should hold value.</p>
<p>The items you are thinking of fall in the first category: alcohol, cigarettes, ammunition, medication, ETC. These are barter goods: You want these because even if the person you trade with doesn't want them, he might know someone who does and trade anyways. </p>
<p>The second kind is something like gold: It has high value. This is necessary because sometimes, you can't barter for something based on the sheer value.</p>
<p>As for the reason it keeps this value, it's a set of reasons: It's of graded purity (so it's fungible and consistently valued), and can be tested for purity (either chemically or using a touchstone) It's chemically resistant and ductile, making it difficult to lose value. It has use in fabrication, electronics, chemistry and artistry, giving it some universal appeal similar to the bartering goods above. It's concealable and easily dividable as well, which are both good qualities for a trade good.</p>
<p>In terms of the collapse however, the thing they're actually saying when they say buy gold or silver is that you need to own physical assets of your wealth, since if the system collapses, you will not be getting anything out of certificates, paper money or digital accounts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
