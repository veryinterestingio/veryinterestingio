Babies and young kids don't have this skill down yet. This is also why you may sleep much lighter than normal in an unfamiliar environment. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason you don’t act your dreams out when you’re sleeping is due to something called “muscle atonia”. Essentially your brain releases chemicals into your body that paralyze you when you’re sleeping. This stops the body from incurring preventable injuries whilst unconscious. </p>
<p>What’s creepy is that, sometimes you can be awake while all your muscles are paralyzed in a state called “sleep paralysis”. Generally in this state people experience abject terror(terror that is far greater than most people experience in their lives)- and hallucinate malevolent beings “looming” over them. </p>
<p>There are also individuals that can act out their dreams because there is something wrong with their brains ability to paralyze the body. A mild form of this is sleepwalking. But some people freak the fuck out in bed completely asleep. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many others have already explained that the brain puts the body in temporary paralysis specifically when you dream, so that you don't start acting out in your sleep. But an interesting fact is that this is also why you often feel so weak in your dreams. Like when you try to run and just move on the spot, or you try to punch someone and nothing happens. The body feedback if not doing anything seems to return to the brain for processing, and the brain isn't quite able to interpret this inactivity correctly.</p>
<p>Now, I did a lot of martial arts when I was younger and I developed a pretty mean right kick. For some reason, this move seems to be so deeply ingrained in my muscle memory that it overrides this paralysis. Only the right leg though. I tend to have a vivid dream life and not seldom there is violence. I've kicked with full force into my concrete bedroom wall several times and it hurts like all hell. I'm lucky I haven't broken any bones in my right foot yet. Probably because I have nothing to push back against so I basically just kick myself out of bed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
