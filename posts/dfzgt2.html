		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a common story that as a massive object accelerates closer to the speed of light, it gets heavier and heavier, so applying a constant force accelerates it less and less. This is an antiquated and not particularly helpful way to look at things, based on shoehorning relativistic equations into a Newtonian (i.e., non-relativistic) framework. But the big picture is correct, namely that F=ma no longer applies, and as you apply a force to a massive object, the acceleration caused by that force lessens as the object's velocity approaches the speed of light, such that the speed of light winds up being a limit.</p>
<p>It's a different story for massless particles like photons. The speed of light isn't just a speed limit for photons, it's the <em>only</em> speed they can physically travel at (in vacuum).  Within relativity, there's a clear separation between massive particles, which can only travel at speeds strictly less than the speed of light, and massless ones, which can only travel at the speed of light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a bit abstract, but let me give it a go.</p>
<p>The speed of light is not just about light. The speed of 300,000 km/s was baptised 'the speed of light' as this is the way this particular speed was discovered. This was through experiments measuring the speed of light and later by theoretical means using the mathematical equations that govern the movement of a light wave (these are derived from Maxwell's equations, which govern electromagnetic phenomena and light is, in fact, an electromagnetic phenomenon). However, any object with zero mass travels at 300,000 km/s in vacuum, the photon was just the first particle to have been observed having zero mass. So the more correct, though less catchy, way to call it would be 'speed of massless particles through vacuum'. I guess the speed of light just stuck.</p>
<p>A more modern and general way to define the speed of 300,000 m/s is 'the largest speed at which <em>information</em> can travel through vacuum', but I don't feel it's necessary to open up that box here.</p>
<p>I don't know <em>why</em> massless objects can only travel at the speed of light. As far as I know, we just know it from many observations, but someone might have a better answer to this.</p>
<p>The way I look at it is like this: The speed of light is part of the <em>geometry</em> of this universe. As you may know, the current consensus is that the universe has three spatial dimensions (forward/backward, sideways and up/down) and one time dimension. A three dimensional object has a shape, like a cube, or a sphere. The universe also has a shape, but it's a four dimensional shape. That's of course very difficult to visualise, but just keep the idea of shape in your head and understand that a four dimensional thing can have a shape.</p>
<p>To continue the analogy, a cube has a number determining its geometry. That number can be the length of its edges, or the length of its diagonal. A sphere has a number determining its geometry and that is its radius, or diameter. There are shapes that need more numbers determining their shape; a triangle actually needs several; you cannot determine the shape of a triangle if I just give you the length of one edge. In the same way, the speed of light, 300,000 m/s, is one of the numbers determining the four dimensional shape of our universe. As far as I know, we don't know why this number is the way it is and why it isn't some other number.</p>
<p>There are other numbers which determine the shape of our universe, just like there are several numbers that determine the shape of a triangle. For example, the total matter content of the universe. Or the gravitational constant. The speed of light is one of these numbers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Photons have a fixed speed because they are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">electromagnetic waves</a>. Changing magnetic fields produce electric fields, and changing electric fields produce magnetic fields. This was shown by Faraday. Maxwell took it further and considered that if a magnetic flux produced an electric flux, and an electric flux produced a magnetic flux, then this phenomenon would propagate through space forever. This phenomenon would be called electromagnetic radiation. He took the work done by Faraday, Gauss and Ampere and worked out the wave equations for the electromagnetic radiation, which showed that it would have a speed c, equal to approximately 300,000 km/s. This just so happened to be precisely the same speed that light had already been measured to have. Therefore he deduced that light must be an electromagnetic wave.</p>
<p>Light has a fixed speed because it is an electromagnetic wave and therefore must follow the wave equations.</p>
<p>Einstein then took this idea and thought really hard about it. The laws of physics must be the same in all reference frames. Whether you are moving and I am stationary, or I am moving and you are stationary, or we are both moving, in all of these situations the same laws of physics must apply. We can't have different laws just because we are travelling at different speeds because there is no way to really know which one of us is 'moving'. According to Newtonian physics, all velocities add together. Let's say there is a train moving at 60 km/hr. If I am on the train and I throw a ball forwards at 5 km/hr then I see it move at 5 km/hr. But if you are standing at the train station you would see the same ball move at 65 km/hr - the velocity I threw it at, plus the velocity of the train. Now what happens if, instead of throwing a ball, I shine a torch at you? What speed would the light from the torch be measured at, by you? According to Newtonian calculations you would think it would be the velocity of the train (let's call it 'v') plus the velocity of light ('c'). Or, v+c. But it's not! It's just c! From this one simple idea Einstein proposed that space and time could not be separated from each other, and should instead be considered together in one unit 'spacetime'. And this very shortly led to a lot of crazy conclusions, including: length contraction, time dilation, the equivalence of energy and mass, relativity of simultaneity and a speed for causality. And this is before we start putting gravity into the picture!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
