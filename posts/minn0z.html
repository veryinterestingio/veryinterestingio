Several of the &quot;experts&quot; the mother is planning to call have said the same thing: there are no studies showing vaccines are safe.</p>
<p>That kind of peaked my interest, because my initial gut reaction was &quot;can these studies prove something is safe?&quot; and wondering if someone can confirm/deny/elaborate. My sense is epidemeology studies could show that the data indicate vaccines are <strong>not unsafe,</strong> but that no study can say if a medicine/vaccine is &quot;safe&quot; because there are always unknowns. Kind of like how evolution is a &quot;theory&quot; only because we can't run repeatable experiments, but it's basically a law in all other respects. Am I on the right track?</p></div></div>

<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/vaccines-licensed-use-united-states" target="_blank">https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/vaccines-licensed-use-united-states</a></p>
<p>IANAL but I would guess you could find there documents that could be easily introduced as evidence for the safety and efficacy of any vaccine available.  You don't need to prove that the vaccine has a 0% chance of having an adverse reaction.  You just need to prove that having the vaccine is much less likely to be adverse than the disease it prevents.  Pain at the injection site &lt; dying from measles.</p>
<p>I don't know how likely you are to get an FDA representative to testify but here is the contact page for the relevant department</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/center-drug-evaluation-and-research-cder/cder-contact-information" target="_blank">https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/center-drug-evaluation-and-research-cder/cder-contact-information</a></p>
<p>Edit: There's also no evidence that being vaccinated weakens the immune system overall.  The immune system doesn't function like a muscle and doesn't get stronger overall by fighting one particular disease.  In fact, in a very broad sense, the vaccination gives you the immune response you would have if you had suffered from the disease without all the messy side effects like vomiting, diarrhea, and death. Here's one meta study that speaks to this.  There are others.  <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2673970" target="_blank">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2673970</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
