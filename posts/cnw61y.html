		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh, man, is this question right up my alley.</p>
<p>Europa and Enceladus are definitely in a permanent state.  They get so little sunlight that even if you caused them to melt somehow, they'd just freeze right back up again.</p>
<p>The &quot;two-state&quot; nature of Earth's climate comes about because of the ice albedo feedback: ice is white, and so it reflects away sunlight and keeps the planet cold; water is dark, so it absorbs sunlight and keeps the planet warm.</p>
<p>The Earth gets the right amount of sunlight that when it's covered in water, it absorbs enough sunlight to stay above freezing, and when it's covered in ice, it absorbs little enough sunlight to stay frozen.  But if it were closer to the Sun, even an ice-covered Earth would be too hot to be frozen, and so only the water-covered Earth is possible.  If it were farther away, only the frozen Earth is possible.</p>
<p>Aaaanyway, Europa's ice absorbs only 30% of the sunlight that strikes it, and its surface temperature is about 110 Kelvin (-300 Fahrenheit).  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_model#Zero-dimensional_models" target="_blank">simplest possible climate models</a> predict that if the planet is in balance so energy in equals energy out, temperature (in Kelvin) should be proportional to albedo to the 1/4 power (square root of square root).</p>
<p>Deep water oceans absorb about 95% of the sunlight that strikes them.  And so we can predict that if something caused Europa to melt, its steady-state temperature would be (110) * (95% / 30%)^(1/4) = 147 Kelvin, or -200 Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>A hefty warming, but definitely it's just going to freeze back up again.  Enceladus is even worse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Europa and Eceladus are almost certainly permanently encased in ice, for a couple reasons:</p>
<p>First, their distance from the sun gives very little solar heating compared to the earth. As radiated energy flux scales as the distance to the radiator squared, and Jupiter averages just over five times farther from the sun than the earth, Europa gets about 25 times less solar energy per square meter than the earth. Saturn is about nine times further from the sun than the earth, so Enceladus gets somewhere around 80 times less solar energy per unit area than the earth does.</p>
<p>Second, these moons have no significant atmosphere to speak of. Water has no stable liquid phase below about 0.6% of atmospheric pressure. Without a mechanism to generate an atmosphere, the water will always be ice or gas, or be on its way to one of these two phases.</p>
<p>Third, in the snowball earth situation, runaway glaciers increased the albedo -- the amount of light the earth reflects back into space -- enough that glaciers completely covered the earth. Once this occurred, large amounts of CO2 from volcanism built up in the atmosphere as one of the primary ways CO2 is removed from the atmosphere is by the weathering of certain rocks, which is severely slowed in the absence of rain. Europa and Enceladus have minimal, if any, volcanism (maybe cryovolcanos?), and very little atmosphere, so we aren't likely to see any significant changes to the greenhouse effect there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Europa and Enceldaus are known to have geothermal activity, but they are ALSO wayyyyy further from the Sun than Earth, and there is almost certainly no conceivable way they could thaw and stay unfrozen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What is interesting to note is that the snowball Earth is apparently still a very heated debate in the geological community. I had one geology professor (a vulcanologist) tell the class that it was a &quot;slushball&quot; not a &quot;snowball&quot; if it even happened at all, while another professor of mine (a paleontologist) taught us snowball Earth like it was an undisputed fact. Maybe my vulcanologist professor had some stigmas but still interesting to see two very learned professors at the same University disagree on something.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ooh! Fun!</p>
<p>Okay, for analogy’s sake, let’s compare Germany and the most-southern region of Antarctica.</p>
<p>Germany gets a lot more sun than Antarctica, but it does get cold and snowy in the winters (which, I presume, has Europeans practically salivating at the thought of right now, considering the heat wave.)</p>
<p>That’s pretty similar to Earth in comparison to Europa.</p>
<p>Earth has a lot more sun than Europa, so it’s more cyclical.</p>
<p>Now, it does get a bit more niche than that; atmospheric conditions millions of years ago basically allowed for colder conditions by being a thin napkin instead of a thermal blanket, and a lot less energy was retained on an annual basis due to much lower greenhouse gas levels.</p>
<p>The equilibrium shifts here on a somewhat regular basis.</p>
<p>Well, shift <em>ed</em> thanks to us; humans contribute 3% of the world’s greenhouse gases each year or so. Doesn’t sound like much, but keep in mind it was (essentially) a zero-sun game before. It was all regulated and accounted for, but we added in stuff that wasn’t a part of any cycle. It keeps building up like interest on an IRA, and soon well either deal with it or die off as it gets out of control.</p>
<p>Wow, that went in an entirely odd tangent, but that’s the basic idea.</p>
<p>TL;DR Earth has cycles of warm because of gas in the atmosphere and closeness to the sun, but Europa gets the equivalent of a flashlight to heat the planet, so until the sun expands, it’ll be frozen.</p>
<p>EDIT: Clarity in analogies</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
