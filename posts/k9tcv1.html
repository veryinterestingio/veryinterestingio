		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s some math that helps explain this, and it really boils down to two aspects:</p>
<p>• What is the &quot;secondary infection/attack rate&quot; of the virus (as in, how many people on average does an infected person infect)? Call that “R0”. For COVID-19, it’s currently estimated around 2.5 to 3.5. Edit: Keep in mind that these values are generally assumed to be the rates for a population that is generally inoculated and following safe behavior.. on its own, though, this virus appears to have an R0 closer to about 5.7 - so, if we're talking about trying to take a widespread-infected population toward a safe number, we ought to work from that value as a target. More info:</p>
<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0282_article" target="_blank">https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0282_article</a></p>
<p>• How effective is the “inoculating agent” (be that a vaccine or “immunity”(-ish) from prior exposure)? Call that “E”. The major vaccines being pushed right now are around 94% effective, which is awesome.</p>
<p>With these numbers, the “Critical Vaccination Threshold” (as in, the percentage of people that need to be inoculated to have what’s considered “herd immunity”) comes out roughly to:</p>
<p>(1 – 1 / R0) / E</p>
<p>So, plug in the worst case above: maybe only 90% effective with an R0 of 5.7 (edited with the higher R0 referenced above):</p>
<p>( 1 - 1 / 5.7 ) / 0.90 = 91.6%-ish (!) needed</p>
<p>Take that same R0 of 5.7 and increase the vaccine effectiveness to 94%:</p>
<p>( 1 - 1 / 5.7 ) / 0.94 = 87.7% needed</p>
<p>Then, as communities are getting more vaccinated and the overall secondary infection rates go down, we can use a better case of R0 = 2.5 (and effectiveness of 94%) to get what we'd need to <em>maintain</em> &quot;Herd Immunity&quot;:</p>
<p>( 1 - 1 / 2.5 ) / 0.94 = 63.8% needed</p>
<p>Of course, this is all raw statistical numbers and takes nothing else into account (population age, level of safety practice compliance, etc.), but it’s still a good number to go off of for larger populations when you average it all out.</p>
<p>Some further info: </p>

<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Many great points were brought up below, namely that achieving &quot;Herd Immunity&quot; does NOT mean that everyone is 100% safe. We will all still need to be diligent about following safety guidelines, especially on the way toward that critical threshold. Also, the numbers above are for a &quot;given population&quot;, so consideration must be given to the types of populations we're talking about. /u/Moose<em>Springsteen</em> made a great comment about it below:</p>

<p>Edit 2: some verbiage updates/clarifications, and a major edit that /u/AbsentGlare pointed out regarding R0 rates in an ideal vs. widespread-infection scenario.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Herd immunity depends on what &quot;herd&quot; you are talking about. </p>
<p>Take Measles for example. Overall immunity rates in the US are high enough for herd immunity, but that is not the case in some communities. Orthodox Jewish communities in NYC often have much lower rates. Consequently, there have been major outbreaks in those communities. You can see similar patterns in other communities with low vaccination rates.  </p>
<p>So even if you vaccinated every adult, that would not fully protect children. Especially if those children were grouping together everyday at school.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The biggest blocker to any concept of &quot;herd immunity&quot; is that the prioritization of the vaccine will likely affect a different &quot;herd&quot;.    For example, Given that currently the vast majority of deaths hospitalization are with a population &gt; 60 years old, every vaccine distribution plan aligns with this population getting the vaccine first.    If you're 40 years old, it won't do a thing for your herd.</p>
<p>There are roughly 1.2 million Americans living in nursing homes.</p>
<p>If we could quickly vaccinate this specific population, it could have a quick and meaningful reduction in deaths and hospital utilization, which would be massive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pfizer has started studies on children between the ages of 12 and 18. Moderna has recently announced they will start a study on the same age group. At this time, they will not give the vaccine to children until the studies are done but eventually children will need to get the vaccine, considering they usually are asymptomatic carriers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It highly depends on who you vaccinate first. 10-20% of the population are responsible for 80% of infections. One study in India found only 6% were responsible for 80% of the spread. 71% don't spread the virus at all. </p>
<p>Obviously we cant automatically know who is a super spreader and who is not, but what we can do is know who is more likely. Service workers, healthcare workers especially have massively outsized transmission rates. In some ways this will self filter, as those who are putting themselves into risky situations might feel that they should go out of their way to get the vaccine, meaning they will have an outsized reduction on the transmission rate. </p>
<p>So no, its not likely to be 2/3rds. If every single person spread it to exactly the same amount of people, then yes, it would be that high. But instead its a small minority of society spreading it to everybody else. Aim your vaccinations at those who spread it the most, and you can reduce the spread massively with a smaller amount of vaccinations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
