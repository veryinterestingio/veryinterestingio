		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Beavers instinctively know the basics of dam building.  They have an instinct to pile sticks and mud on the sound of running water, and are very cued in to changes in the sound of running water.  In the context of streams of the right size, this means piling sticks and woods on shallow areas where the water is noisiest, and then piling them on the holes and gaps in the growing beaver dam structure and plugging any leaks where water noisily leaks through.   That's not quite <em>all</em> that's going on, but if you put a speaker playing the sound of running water out in a field near a beaver dam, it will shortly have a pile of sticks on it.  </p>
<p>EDIT:  There's a video of a beaver living in someone's house linked elsewhere in this thread.  Note how the woman mentions him damming up around her sink and bathtub?  I bet the beaver is hearing water flow through the pipes and that's why he's damming there.  </p>
<p>Quite a lot of animal constructions work that way, they emerge from relatively simple instincts. </p>
<p>Humans have a lot of instincts, but many of the most notable ones are instincts for learning....the instincts that lead us to learn how to talk and walk and interact with other people.  </p>
<p>I've seen speculation that our distant ancestors had an instinctive predisposition to making acheulean handaxes, but that remains merely a speculation.  If instincts for acheulean  handaxes existed, they seem to be long gone.  But in general, people are carrying around these enormous, metabolically expensive brains.  These brains have the major advantage of allowing us to learn  complex behaviors to deal with our environment. So generally speaking our tool and structure making is learned, allowing it to be much more flexible than instinctive behaviors.   If you've got all that brain, you might as well get the advantages of it!</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>It's always the random comments you make that blow up when you aren't looking.  I wanted to post some sources for this one since it's gotten so big</p>
<p>Here's Lars Wilsson's research on beavers.  He did a lot of the key early researcher, although others have done stuff since</p>

<p>Here's probably the main paper arguing that handaxes were instinctive</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human instincts are not what you usually think of as instinct. But there are some things that are hard wired in, and they mostly revolve around the fact that we are highly social creatures.</p>
<p>Communication: there are specific areas of the brain dedicated to communication. Spoken and written language, sign language, etc. I believe if a bunch of kids somehow grew up together somewhere that language didn't exist, they'd naturally invent one.</p>
<p>Facial recognition: infants seem to be very good at facial recognition. Actually, we take for granted how complicated a process it is because it happens naturally, but people with damage to the facial recognition centers of the brain don't even recognize their own face.</p>
<p>Empathy: we have a great capacity to feel one another's emotions. Brain scans show that if we watch someone get hurt there is activity in the same areas of the brain as if we actually felt it ourselves. Ever watch someone get hit hard in the nuts then flinch and hiss and cover your groin?</p>
<p>It's believed a lot of other curious traits are a result from our socialness; such as religions, culture and style, our capacity for tribalism (Russia vs USA, Brits vs French, etc).</p>
<p>When you think about it, our greatest strength is our ability to form societies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There aren't a lot of complex structured behaviors we're aware of in humans that aren't transmitted socially, or that aren't implicitly social.  It's very difficult to study.  There are lots of simple perceptual filters, like an affinity for faces or verbal interaction or secondary sexual characteristics, an aversion to snakes/spiders or bitter foods or sudden movements in the night or bumps in your skin.  But building structures and tools seems to be mostly hominid culture, transmitted from generation to generation.</p>
<p>Here's one curiously consistent behavior pattern that arose out of police investigations, where it seemed like 20% of cases of death by hypothermia suggested some kind of foul play &amp; an attempt to hide the body, even in conditions where foul play was wildly unlikely:</p>
<p>&quot;Terminal Burrowing Behavior&quot; is seen in end-stage hypothermia, and involves wandering off in a trance, tearing off all your clothes as you walk, and crawling on all fours into any available low shelter - a cave, under tree branches, under a table or bed, into a closet.  This appears to be some remnant of a hibernation instinct not used in millions of years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
