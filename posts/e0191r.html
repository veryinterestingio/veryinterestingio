		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For most fabric. The dye is first added then fixed with special chemicals. The details vary a lot by the colour and chemistry but often the fixing agent activates at very high temperatures that won’t happen in a normal wash. You can bleach many fabrics by boiling them in running water. </p>
<p>Polyester is different. It doesn’t absorb liquid under normal conditions so it’s typically bulk dyed. The polyester yarn is made with coloured plastic pellets so the fabric itself is coloured.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surprised no one has mentioned indigo yet since it's a very common dye.  It's the blue in blue jeans!  What is very interesting is that indigo is not soluble in water.  A reducing agent is used to convert it to a colorless, soluble form.  The fabric is then soaked in the solution and removed to air dry.  Oxygen in the air converts the indigo back to it's insoluble blue form and the garment turns blue before your eyes.  I'm not entirely clear on this part, but it seems the tiny insoluble blue particles get trapped in the cotton fibers and not exactly bound to them.  Someone please correct me if that's not the case, I can't seem to find a source.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some dyes will create bonds to the surface of the fibers on the fabric.  Different dyes and material have dramatically different properties.  I remember a lab I did on college where we made a red dye and had a series of fabrics to dye.  One of the fabrics turned out blue with a red dye.</p>
<p>Synthetic fibers get dyes mixed throughout the material.     Some dyes are powders that are mixed with the fibers.</p>
<p>That's probably a lot more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another process that no one has mentioned is dye sublimation. These are special inks that are used to dye polyester and similar man-made fibers after production of the fabric. The process works by printing out an image with special dye and paper on, what amounts to, really fancy, and very expensive, ink jet printers. The image is then pressed onto the fabric to a high temperature (typically above 350 F) with specialty heat presses. The ink sublimates, i.e., turns into a gas, and permeates into the actual fiber. </p>
<p>A lot of stuff you see that's polyester has been dyed in this fashion, especially where there's a lot of pattern, or images. So, if you're an anime fan, wallscrolls are made like this. Those very colorful bowling shirts with lot of pictures are also made like this, as are a lot of Hawaiian shirts (if they're poly). In short, if you see clothing that's got a complex pattern all over it, or images all over it, and it's polyester or similar fabric, it was made in this fashion.</p>
<p>I own a business with my husband, and we do a lot of dye sublimation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
