<p>Partial agonist = molecule that binds to receptor and acts like the endogenous ligand but partially causes X effect. Not as strong. When placed with an agonist, acts as a competitive antagonist. </p>
<p>Inverse agonist = molecule that binds ot receptor and causes the opposite effect of X.</p>
<p>Antagonist = molecule that binds to receptor and does nothing. Does nothing if agonist is not present, but has a 'negative' effect if the agonist is present. Can be competitive, taking the same spot as the agonist, blocking it, or noncompetitive, taking another spot that completely stops the receptor from working. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Agonist - Key goes in lock, machine works more.</p>
<p>Antagonist - Key goes in lock, machine doesn't respond.</p>
<p>Inverse agonist - If the machine is always running - key goes in lock, machine works less.</p>
<p>Partial agonist - Key goes in lock, machine works more but not at its maximum.  (If a different key was used it would work better)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit:  A bit more on antagonists.</p>
<p>Key is magnetic.  Lock is metal and so is machine.</p>
<p>Competitive antagonist - key goes in lock, machine doesn't respond, other keys can push it out and get in lock too.</p>
<p>Non competitive antagonist - either</p>
<ol>
<li>Key goes in lock and gets stuck.  No other keys can get in.</li>
<li>Key lodges itself in the cogs.  (Allosteric)</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Agonists (partial) = Car is on Drive and you are driving 20-30mph
Agonists (full) = Car is on Drive, you're flooring it at max speed 150mph+
Antagonists =  Car is in Park.
Inverse agonists = Car is in Reverse.</p>
<p>Basically, agonists bind to the receptor and cause them to do X. Partial agonists cause a slight effect, but have less potency/affinity than some other agonist. Antagonists compete for the same receptor as an agonist, bind to it and prevent he agonist from binding. This is how many toxins work, they block receptors. Inverse agonists bind to the receptor and cause the OPPOSITE effect of the agonist. Rather than simply just blocking the receptor, they not only block but cause the opposite function to occur.</p>
<p>So a partial agonist might cause a receptor to release slightly more than normal, a full agonist maximizes release, an antagonist blocks the agonist, causing the receptor to simply activate at its base rate, inverse agonist would cause the opposite (no release)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Agonists - promote the function in one direction.</p>
<p>Partial agonists - promote the function in the same direction but to a lesser degree.</p>
<p>Inverse agonists - promote function in opposite direction.</p>
<p>Antagonists - block the function</p>
<p>(Depending on situation, antagonists and inverse agonist can yield the same result. If there's sort of an &quot;on/off&quot; function then both antagonists and inverse agonists will push for the same outcome).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
