		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no.</p>
<p>It is possible to create molecules with several Si-Si bonds just like with carbon, but those are less stable than Carbon bonds.</p>
<p>In addition Silicon Hydrogen bonds are pretty reactive.</p>
<p>Just compare Methane, a pretty stable and unreactive molecule, with Silane, which combusts in air without any help.</p>
<p>That's because the electronegativity of Silicon and Carbon are different, which affects the Si-H bond.</p>
<p>As the other people mentioned Silicon Oxygen bonds are quite stable, that's what Silicone (the polymer) is.</p>
<p>Still, Carbon is the only known element that forms &quot;unlimited&quot; amounts of different molecules where the Carbon is directly bound to another Carbon.</p>
<p>Adding a CH2 group to elongate a molecule does not make it less stable.</p>
<p>This is called catenation, and allows so many different carbon compounds to exist.</p>
<p>Silicon, ( and Sulfur and Boron) allows for limited amount of Catenation, while Carbon allows basically unlimited chain length and branching.</p>
<p>The longest silicon chain that is somewhat possible to create contains 8 Silicon atoms in a chain. Everything longer will decompose on its own, into unspecific Silicon hydride polymers.</p>
<p>Si8H18 is the sum formula for that.</p>
<p>In addition Carbon can form very stable double and triple bonds, the same bonds are possible with Silicon, but they are extremely unstable. the simple molecules <del>Disilane</del> Disilene and Disilyne are possible to isolate, but anything more complex falls apart.</p>
<p><strong>Tl;Dr</strong> They are very similar, and both allow Catenation, but the addition of another electron shell in Silicon changes the properties (electronegativity) just slightly, so that longer chains get less stable, compared to Carbon chains getting more stable and bonds with Hydrogen have more of a hydride characteristic than the covalent bond between Carbon and Hydrogen.
Thus lifeforms in anyway similar to earth's life is impossible on a silicon basis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sure. Si atoms are also incorporated into organic molecules with four possible bonds. These silanes can have interesting and useful properties; for instance, the company Silatronix has shown that they can be used in lithium ion batteries to stabilize the electrolyte mixture.</p>
<p>To answer from a slightly different perspective: one of silicon's useful incorporations is as an oxide support. Silica -silicon oxide - is used for many of the same applications as graphite and graphene. In this sense, the overall similarity of these two memvers of group IV is clear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if anyone has mentioned it yet, but one factor that limits Silicons ability to act as an organic molecule is its size. By being physically larger than Carbon, it is limited in the bonds that it can form. A common example is Carbon Dioxide, which is a simple covalent gas. Meanwhile Silicon Dioxide is a giant covalent molecule you would know as sand (A giant covalent molecule is one where a repeating pattern of covalently bonded atoms make up a giant structure). </p>
<p>This is because Carbon can form pi bonds with Oxygen. Pi bonds are caused by an overlap of P orbitals, and can exist above and below the plane of a regular Sigma bond. These can exist in Carbon - Oxygen bonds (as the sigma bond length is quite low). This means that CO2 can be simple while still observing the octet rule. As Silicon is larger, it cannot form pi bonds (as the sigma bonds are too long to allow the p orbitals to overlap) meaning that to observe the octet rule it has to form 4 sigma bonds, leading to the giant structure of Silicon Dioxide. Silicons size is just one of the factors that lead to it not being able to do many of the things carbon can chemically.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Silicon has a whole extra shell of electrons compared to carbon. It's still tetravalent, but the orbitals are bigger and floppier and hazier than in carbon. This makes it less able to hold its electrons and makes overlap between orbitals poorer, leading to less covalent nature in its bonding. Instead you see more metallic type bonding. Another thing that arises because of this is that silicon tends to not make double bonds, but graphite does. this is why carbon will make graphene-type structures with pi bonding and resonance and so on, but silicon won't. Silicon sticks to single bonds if it does bond covalently, and tends to be more metallic in nature generally. It will still form covalent lattices if you mix it something like oxygen though. Glasses and crystals and so on are silicates.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
