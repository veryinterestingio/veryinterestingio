That water is of course hot from taking the heat away from the engine. Under the dash board in the car is a small radiator that the hot water runs through. Add a fan behind it and you have a heated cabin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your car heating is sucking cold air in, passing it through the grids of the heater core. The heater core is part of the liquid cooling system of your engine, and essentially works like a radiator in a room heating. It will only be hot when the engine is heated up a bit though. Only then it will be able to heat up the cold air and effectively providing hot air to your passenger compartment.</p>
<p>There are systems that allow heating operation right from the moment you get into the car. They are turned on by a timer or a remote control some time before. What they do is they are basically small fuel burners that heat up the cooling liquid of the cooling system.  That way the heating works  immediately, and also the engine is already warmed up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heat comes either from the engine or resistive heaters. When heat comes from the engine there's a heat exchanger in the dash (the heater core) that uses hot engine coolant to warm the air. Resistive heaters (electric powered) are seen in hybrids and all electric cars where there is no engine or the engine may not get hot quickly at all. Resistive heaters are also available in large diesel vehicles where you may be operating it somewhere it's so cold it may not warm quickly either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
