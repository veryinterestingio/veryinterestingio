		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others in this thread have mentioned how difficult it is to prove the healthier babies/ stronger relationship aspect of the question. </p>
<p>But -  your skin <strong>can</strong> tell if it's touching someone else's skin. There are an entire class of sensory receptors in the skin that respond best to soft pressure, <strong>skin temperature</strong>, slow movement touch - essentially being stroked (called Low Threshold Mechanoreceptors) </p>
<p>To be a bit un-ELI5 this is called affective touch and neuroscientists are only recently discovering its receptors and pathways in the nervous system. The theory goes that if the body can discriminate human contact using these receptors, it can then release the chemical oxytocin to re-enforce that personal relationship. e.g. between a new-born child and the mother holding it.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Taken from a psychology standpoint, it could have nothing to do with the fact that it is just &quot;skin&quot;, but more to the point that close physical contact with people you care about nourishes a more accepting and mentally healthy environment. Albert Einstein was quoted as saying &quot;The single most important decision any of us will ever make is whether or not to believe the universe is friendly.&quot; This one small distinction made early on plays a major role in how we take in and interpret information from the world around us. What chemicals are released in the brain during close physical contact with loved ones. Just physiologically, hugging someone and other forms of nonsexual touching cause your brain to release oxytocin, known as the &quot;bonding hormone&quot;. This stimulates the release of other feel-good hormones, such as dopamine and serotonin, while reducing stress hormones, such as cortisol and norepinephrine. All that being said, this may explain why it does feel so good to sit on a leather couch. Subconsciously triggering chemicals related to those mentioned above.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just echo here what others have said about the benefits, but also:</p>
<p>Skin and leather are very different. The skin of another person is often warmer than leather (if your couch is warmer than your SO, you may have a problem), has a much higher moisture content, and has an elasticity, softness, and shape not typically found in leather goods.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I find this thread fascinating. I was adopted as a baby, and was premature so spent the first 3 months of my life in an incubator with basically zero human contact (the tech for preemies was pretty rudimentary back then, and they didn’t have baby hugging volunteers like they have now). I have an extremely hard time with touch/romantic relationships (I’m in a long term relationship but have never been touchy-feely at all, which others find weird for a woman…). So I’d love to see some peer-reviewed studies that may explain if there’s any connection here or if it’s pure coincidence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
