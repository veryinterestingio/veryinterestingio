Basically, grains roll and bounce along the windward, more gentle side of a dune and are deposited at the top of the leeward, steeper side of the dune (i.e. the slip face). These grains build up until they destabilize the slip face and avalanche down towards the base of the dune. This is a fundamental part of how a dune migrates.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From the perspective of Jamming, or un-jamming in this case. Both same dunes and snow mountains un-jam at critical shear stress and then begin sliding downhill. However, this phenomenon is highly dependent on the material that is being jammed. Sand is a dry frictional poly-disperse material that un-jams at critical stress directly relate to its angle of repose and it well determined for different types of sand. Snow on the other hand is a potentially wet, mono-disperse material that has a highly variable critical shear stress dependent upon things like humidity, temperature, etc. So unlike sand, snow avalanches are less predictable and can sometimes build up much greater stresses leading to catastrophe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said dunes have small slides constantly based primarily on the angle of repose of the sand particles. Snow avalanches occur on slopes between °25-°45 snow unlike sand changes based on temperature and humidity once it is on the ground. These process cause the formation of layers in the snow pack some can be very weak and some can be very strong. There is a lot of science I’m leaving out, but essentially when you have strong snow on top of weak snow something can come along and cause the weak snow to collapse and the strong snow begins to slide on top of the weak snow. The strong snow is so well bonded to its neighbor that it causes the avalanche to propagate across the slope and the whole thing gets very big and can destroy lots of things.  Unlike the sand dune slide that just kind of sluff off constantly but in small amounts to maintain itself near or at its angle of repose. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sand piles up with gravity working on each grain individually. The violence of a snow avalanche is due to the fact that snow adheres to itself and can build horizontally until the weight is enough to break it free.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Snow avalanches occur because of weak layers being overloaded by new or wind blown snow. Old snow degrades and turns into crystals. The new snow on top can adhere to each other and become this huge block. Eventually it breaks loose naturally or by a person. People dig pits into mountain sides to view the different layers from past storms to make a best judgement decision on the stability of the snow on the slope. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
