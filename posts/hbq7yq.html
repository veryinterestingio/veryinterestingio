		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You slouch because your paraspinal muscles (among others) get tired, so it feels better in the short term to do that. The problem is that you’re then just “hanging out” on your other soft tissue structures (discs, ligaments, joint capsules), which get strained over time (think of pushing past an elastic barrier to a plastic deformation, aka tearing). Eventually you would start to break down tissues that you want to be healthy, and you will start having pain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Slouching is not bad for you in moderation.  </p>
<p>Slouching for 14 hours a day is bad for you. </p>
<p>The problem is that human bodies are designed to <em>move</em>.   We’re not designed to be continuously still in any pose, be it lying down, standing up, or in a semi-recumbent position - slouched or otherwise. </p>
<p>A slouch is a position of rest.  In and of itself there is nothing wrong with it.   But as we have increasingly sedentary lifestyles, our rest-to-activity ratios change.   We stop using our muscles enough.   With that comes degradation.   Our bodies need to move to function properly - our joints must constantly swing or else they stiffen, our muscles must be used or they atrophy, we can’t even properly move our blood around our bodies without moving our limbs.    </p>
<p>If we don’t lift ourselves out of the “rest” position and use the muscles that we are resting, it becomes the habit to never engage them and they atrophy.   That is a significant problem and it causes dysfunction and pain.  It means that other muscles need to work harder to do things like lift your head or move your arms or support your torso because you’re not using the muscles you should be using to hold up your chest and head.   These muscles should be “on” for most of the day, with short “slouch breaks”, not the other way around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to have MASSIVE issues with my neck and one shoulder due to slouching at work. About once a year for 3 years I would have 3 days where my neck would completely lock up. I started swimming 5-6 days a week and it is amazing how much it helped. At first it was like my whole back was rebuilding itself for weeks. There was lots of stretching and cracking and tough nights but now I never have any issues. Honestly if I swim my laps in the morning then it feels difficult to slouch. </p>
<p>I really really hope someone who is struggling with a bad back reads this and gives it a try. It changed my life in so many ways. Just get into it slowly and be consistent. Dont worry about building the muscle it will happen on it's own. Did I mention it also helped me lose about 20 pounds of fat and put a lot of it back as muscle?</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the award stranger!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Conditioning matters. Spending tons of time in a chair conditions your body for that posture.</p>
<p>If you spend more time standing up with correct posture than sitting down, then slouching becomes considerably less comfortable than good posture.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
