		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ammunition in guns carry their own oxidizer with them, so they do not need air or oxygen to work.</p>
<p>You can fire a gun in the vacuum of space or underwater and it will still fire.</p>
<p>With the absence of air or anything else to slow it down the bullet will not travel in slow motion, rather the opposite it will travel slightly faster than it ever would have on earth and never slow down until it hits something. Since space is mostly empty chances are that it will never hit anything.</p>
<p>Gravity is not really a big factor with guns unless you are talking long distance shooting or artillery. Gravity is what pulls everything down. It affects the direction of the bullet, it does not slow it down.</p>
<p>What really change things is the lack of air or obstacles to slow or stop any bullet.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind when considering firing a gun in space is that guns are designed to work best in air. Weird things will happen to gun oil and grease used for the lubrication of moving parts in the vacuum of space and metal parts touching each other may get vacuum welded together. Heat also will quickly become a problem as without air heat will have nowhere to go other than the hand holding it and may overheat much more quickly than on earth.</p>
<p>All that in addition to the fact that without a nice planet to stand on the recoil of the gun will turn it very quickly into a mini rocket engine. If you line the gun up with your center of mass it will accelerate you backward. If you hold it normally it will just make you spin around.</p>
<p>The upshot of all that is that you will be able to fire a gun once or twice immediately after taking it out an airlock. The longer you keep it out there the bigger the chance it will stop working. there is also almost no chance of aiming that gun easily after your first shot.</p>
<p>None of that is an unsurmountable problem. If you wanted to shoot guns in space, we could make one that dealt with the problems a lot better than your regular handguns. We have the technology to build guns that have minimal recoil and active cooling is a thing we can do to. Finding out the right materials to use for the different parts to prevent vacuum welding would not be too hard either and an alternative for normal lubrication could be found.</p>
<p>If the need arose we could totally shoot guns in space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
