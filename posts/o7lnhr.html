		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because death-by-Jenga-collapse is basically manslaughter.</p>
<p>You can't just pile in and shift hundreds of tons of collapsed rubble without it moving underneath you, potentially killing anyone who's surviving in a small pocket underneath.  People can and do live for days in such scenarios, and it's better to recover them safely than find out that you caused a collapse which killed someone who would have been relatively uninjured.</p>
<p>Also, what you want in those circumstances is SILENCE.  Every now and again you must ALL stop work, to listen for cries of survivors so you know where to focus your efforts, even if all you can do is reassure them or get water to them, it'll extend their life by days, sometimes weeks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding on to many other helpful comments: most people don't realize that excavators and other heavy machinery essentially do their job by pushing large amounts of material around. So, even if you identify someone trapped in the rubble in a place where further structural collapses aren't a problem, you have to dig them out by hand. Using machinery will just shove more debris onto them, crushing them to death.</p>
<p>Incidentally this is often the mistake people make when workers are trapped by mounds of dirt in collapsed trenches, or other dig sites. Trying to dig them out with an excavator is more likely to get them killed than not. You have to use a shovel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, after all the search and rescue operations are complete, and the investigations by a number of agencies and even insurance companies, (like all the other commenters have said) you still have to actually remove the debris.</p>
<p>The big side dump trucks only hold 14 cubic yards per trip. So you need to be able to hire enough trucks, and have a place to dump everything. All of this takes money and coordination that often can’t occur until the insurance pays out.</p>
<p>For example, the 9/11 debris wasn’t fully cleared until May 2002, and took 108,000 truckloads-1.8 million tons. Where I live, tipping fees are $169 per ton at the landfill… so just clearing the debris was a multi-billion dollar operation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ignoring the search and rescue aspect, as that's been addressed by others, they can't just scoop up the rubble and dump it in a landfill. </p>
<p>First, there's the possibility, even the likelihood, of toxic materials. Asbestos was fairly commonly used until the 1980s, but even newer buildings could have mold, pockets of carbon monoxide, spilled bleach and windex that would create a poison gas. Lots of stuff.</p>
<p>Second, some of the materials are worth saving. Copper pipes and steel rebar, for example, will be separated out and recycled. </p>
<p>Third, there's a safety aspect of just moving tons of material. You can't just ram a bulldozer into a three-story tall pile of rubble, not can you drive an excavator on top of it. So it's logistically challenging.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm no engineer but I believe two reasons: 1) They have to do a search and rescue. Just going in hog wild and removing debris could lead to further collapse, which plays into 2) They have to do it in a certain way to prevent further collapse and risking the lives of first responders.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
