		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The definition of a planet has a few criteria and one of them is that it has to be round. So if an object isn't a sphere, we wouldn't call it a planet.</p>
<p>But that's a bit of a lame explanation. The reason why the things we call planets are round (and the reason that we added &quot;being round&quot; as a requirement for something to be called a planet) is that a sphere is the most energy efficient state for an object to be in when its own gravity is sufficiently strong.</p>
<p>So if a celestial body becomes large enough, its gravity will automatically force it more and more towards a spherical shape. Imagine an object that is otherwise spherical, but contains a large mountain-like structure sticking out from the spherical surface. A rock will roll down from this mountain without requiring additional energy input. This rock rolling down the mountain brings the object closer to a spherical shape. But rolling a rock from the surface up the mountain, making the object less spherical, requires some external force.</p>
<p>So any objects in space that are not spherical are simply too small for their own gravity to pull them together into a ball.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine holding up a magnetic pebbleâ€”no matter the shape. Then have another pebble stick to it. Now add a third and ask yourself: where would this go, such that all pebbles attract one another as equally as possible? Would it go on top of the second so as to form a line? No, because it wouldn't stick to the first, so it'll go right next to them both, making a little triangle, so to speak. Now add a fourth, ask your self the same thing, and you'll find that there's a place next to all three, forming a pyramid, and so on.</p>
<p>You'll find that no matter the shape of your pebbles, if you add enough, by the time you have a bundle the size of your fist, you'll see it take on a spherical shape. It won't be perfect of course, and if you throw it at something it'll bust up, but most things aren't thrown into other things, especially in space. </p>
<p>Now let's approach this another way: if you did make a line out of, say, fifty pebbles, and if they would fit in your jacket pocket given the right shape, what shape would that be? As a line, they'd dangle out of your pocket, and as a sheet they might not fit. You'll find that when you try to compress these pebbles to take up as little space as possible, they'll again arrange into an imperfect sphere.</p>
<p>As it turns out, particles in terms of gravity aren't biased towards other particles as much as they are in terms of magnetism. The pebbles above very much want to click to the nearest one, but on the scale where gravity is the determining factor everything wants to stick to everything roughly just as much. That's why a pebble rolls down hill: it's much closer to the collection of pebbles that make up the planet than if it were on top of the hill, just like your pebble was much closer to the rest if it completed a triangle of three or a pyramid of four, etc.</p>
<p>And that's geometry for ya.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Planets have a strong gravity. Gravity attracts things towards the center of mass, i.e. everything within the influence of gravity wants to get as close as possible to the center (i.e. everything wants to fall down).</p>
<p>Sphere is the optimal shape such that all matter that comprises a planet is as close as possible to the center.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gravity tends to form point-based attractors. Take any cluster of matter in 3D space and you can find its center of mass, which will always be a singular point. This causes the mass to clump together towards that point, eventually resulting in spherical symmetry. You may notice that smaller bodies such as moons and asteroids tend to have more irregular shapes. This is because they have less mass and thus weaker gravity, so their structure is able to retain some of its unique shape.</p>
<p>Asteroid impacts also play a role in shaping a planet or moon. Think of them as &quot;tenderizing&quot; the surface which causes it to change shape, with gravity being the primary influencer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If any part of it stuck up, it would be a mountain. Gravity tries to pull mountains down. Not even solid granite and basalt can resist the pull of gravity, once the mountain gets high enough.  On Earth, for example, a mountain couldn't get higher than 15 kilometers or so. Mount Everest is 8.8 km.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
