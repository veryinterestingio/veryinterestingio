<p>What is the normal percentage to allow a vaccine to become licensed? How about the MMR for example?</p>

<p>On a population scale, a vaccine with 90% efficacy is pretty good, it means that it reduces the infection rate by 90% (without considering the herd immunity, which can reduce that even more).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>To become licenced it has to be safe and have some efficiency. If the vaccine works only in, say, 10% of the cases, it might just be impractical to produce them in the first place, since there is little incentive to use such vaccines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Licensing of a vaccine depends more on safety rather than efficacy. </p>
<p>Even a vaccine that would be 50% successful can get licensed if it is proven to be safe enough that the overall health of those receiving it is better than those who don’t. </p>
<p>What they are loosening now isn’t the degree by which the vaccine can prevent the disease, but the time period required for safety as we can not afford to say “hey let’s wait a couple of years and see what happens to the people that got the vaccine”.</p>
<p>In case of Covid the results so far show that the vaccine prevents people getting it and does not result in an overly exaggerated immune reaction for those who got it, at least in the majority of people, so that is pretty good compared to getting Covid it self.</p>
<p>Herd immunity happens when roughly 80% of people are immune to the disease, either through vaccine or getting the disease itself. So if the vaccine is only 90% effective, we would need to vaccinate 88% of people to achieve herd immunity by vaccine alone, But if we factor in that 10% of people already gotten the disease in a certain population, then we would need to vaccinate 78% of the population to reach herd immunity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most vaccines that we receive at a young age (such as the MMR vaccine) are very effective and they create sufficient antibodies to make sure that even if we do get infected from a microbe we will have a much better prognosis. I think the actual effective is around 95% for measles and rubella and about 80-85% for mumps. These numbers are great but they are not perfect and that's not nearly enough when we are dealing with human life. Thus, the MMR vaccine is taken in 2 doses in order to achieve the maximum chance of immunization for the vaccinated child. BUT the average flu vaccine is ONLY about 60% effective. With that being said it is still very worth for us to receive the flu vaccine especially if you belong to a vulnerable group or you are a healthcare worker. It is worth noting that while having the flu vaccine for years I still get sick from it (tested positive on Influenza RT) yet I never have any serious symptoms due to the fact the vaccine builds up enough memory cells for me to deal with the infection &quot;on foot&quot; without ever having to stay in bed or miss a day from work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi.  Just want people to spread the word because vaccines are amazing. </p>
<p>Even though some vaccines don't offer 100% protection, the vaccine usually stimulates the immune system and still significantly LESSENS THE SEVERITY OF THE DISEASE to those that are infected. </p>
<p>Infected, yet vaccinated,  creatures generally have a less severe course of the disease, and are significantly less likely to die from the disease. </p>
<p><em>The specific example that we talk about daily with owners is the &quot;strangles&quot; vaccine for horses. In an unvaccinated horse, the disease course is horrible, and often fatal, and HIGHLY contagious. Most vaccines for the disease now offer \~ 85% immunity, and if a vaccinated horse contracts the disease, the (painfully) disgusting symptoms are lessened. (Think lymph nodes fill with pus, abscessing, and bursting open to drain out the pus versus NOT having the lymph nodes fill up with pus, abscess, and burst open to drain out the pus).</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
