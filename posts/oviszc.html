		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally you see clear lakes near mountains. The water running off the mountain is free from alot of pollutants, since there is little farming in the mountains. Often in mountainous streams, the bottom of the river is rocky, meaning that not much sediment (dirt, sand, etc) can be picked up to be transported to the lake. Less sediment equals more clear water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Up high in the mountains? Not many pollutants  </p>
<p>Surrounded by vegetation? Filters everything out  </p>
<p>In a low laying river valley? Murky AF</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two main issues: the first is that you are correct that there is not much debris falling into the waterbody, and definitely low fines content (low amounts of silt and clay, which are slow to sink) AND the water body frequently has no important current to re-suspend any such fines once they settle down to the bottom.  &quot;Pollutants&quot; are generally not suspended solids, but are instead dissolved solids, and at the very low concentrations typical in a waterbody of reasonable purity, do not affect transparency of the water.  </p>
<p>Any waterbody with an important input from a stream or river will have both currents and incoming suspended solids carried in the stream flow, and thus clarity will be reduced (unless the water body is huge compared to the stream influx rate).</p>
<p>If the region has little soil, and is mostly bedrock, then there will not be an important source of fine-grained suspended solids to muck the water up.  This is why many high mountain streams and ponds seem so clear.  Erosion is mostly still making larger-grained sediments that sink fast, and fines all keep on going downstream due to the elevated currents.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
