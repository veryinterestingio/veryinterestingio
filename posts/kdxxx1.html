Combined with recent studies that cast doubt on the efficacy of those mouthwashes in preventing cavities, it's becoming more typical for salt water rinses to be recommended as an alternative.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Microbiologist here. No. Mouthwash is unlikely to cause major perturbations to your oral miceobiome. Here's why:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Alcohol is most effective as a disinfectant at ~65-70% vol/vol. Most mouthwashes that I have used are ~21%, well below the threshold for an effective disinfectant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are too many nooks and crannies to cause an &quot;extinction&quot; of a major lineage that resides in your mouth. You simply can't get the mouthwash to kill everything, and bacteria grow back.</p>
</li>
<li>Brushing your teeth will have a much larger impact. You are using a detergent and mechanical action. Brushing is to mouthwash as hand washing is to hand sanitizer. Hand washing (and teeth brushing) is much more effective at removing bacterial growth.</li>
</ol>
<p>I suppose it is possible that mouthwash could kill off bacterial populations, but the effect would be miniscule as compared to regular teeth brushing. I don't think you need to worry about a 30s swish of 21% alcohol as a major influence on your oral microbiome. Especially if you're comfortable using a brush with a thick detergent to systematicly remove bacterial growth from oral surfaces.</p>

<p>While  have no data on the recovery of bacteria following moutrinse let’s clear up some VERY common misconceptions here. </p>
<ol>
<li>No mouthwash disinfects with alcohol. Alcohol is used as solvent for both essential oil moutrinses (listerine. Yes essential oil makes you think pseudoscience but there’s lots data that listerine does help with gingivitis) and chlorhexidine (which makes a non alcoholic Version too). </li>
<li>mouthrinse is not “useless” as I see many (usually older) dentists say. Rhett are an adjunct. Mechanical removal of biofilm is the gold standard in oral bacteria reduction to prevent caries and periodontal disease. (Brushing and flossing). Without that no medication we use can be effective (fluoride, cpc, any mouthrinse)</li>
<li>There are different types of rinse for different effects. F mouthrinse for high caries risk. Antiseptics for gingivitis. </li>
<li>oral plaque develops over the course of many hours/days. The late colonizers are more of an issue with periodontal disease. That’s why removal of biofilm multiple times a day is what’s needed bc it resets that clock. </li>
</ol>
<p>Listerine and CPC (now stuff like closys which I believe is chlorine dioxide And many say good things) are the over the counter stuff. 0.12% CHX is RX stuff. All have a lot of data showing help with periodontal disease and gingivitis if done in addition to brushing and flossing. </p>
<p>They are better than salt water. But if you aren’t removing the biofilm first might as well use tap water bc it’s not going to help much. (Chlorhexidine does but not enough to stop progression)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your mouth is continuous with the rest of your GI tract. If you sterilize your mouth completely, it will be repopulated by what's in your esophagus before long. And your gut microbiome is constantly changing anyway, and those changes are natural.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
