<p>Egg has garbage sack called an allantois. Garbage sack does gas exchange through the air pocket and tiny holes in egg surface. Garbage sack holds liquid waste. </p>
<p>More or less.</p>
<p>Edit: several people have expressed concern about eating the garbage sack. Because egg has no baby chick, garbage sack has no waste</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey guys, OP here. To answer your question yes, I do remember learning about egg development in  primary, but it goes as far as : &quot; at this time, eyes develop. At this time, the beak develops, an egg needs to be warm&quot;. And that's about it. </p>
<p>I do have some knowledge in development ( community health nurse and currently pregnant with my first child). So I know a decent amount about human gestation, its just eggs seemed like such a blindspot for me.
Right now, this fetus requires so many calories and resources to grow, and an egg is just so.. comparatively bizarre.</p>
<p>Thanks all for all your insights!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because an egg isn't a closed environment, especially compared to the reproduction of eutherian animals as ourselves. Hard eggs are obviously an incredibly successful way to reproduce it gave animals the ability to colonize the land and diversify, it has existed for hundreds of millions of years, and is used by vastly different organisms today. Though eggs do create certain vulnerabilities they definitely work! Eggs contain layers, as the egg forms and hardens a pocket of air is created directly under the shell ,which is porous, and allows the embryo to receive a constant source of oxygen and ventilation of CO2, all the nutrients it needs to develop to hatching is contained in the yolk which the embryo subsists on. Although they are both similar forms of reproduction in technical form; placental mammals are far more complex and a born far more developed. These traits, present in all mammals, are only possible because the greater nutrients and protection offered by developing slowly, protected within our mother, until we are too big for her to support have made mammals incredibly diverse and successful on Earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, an egg is a self supporting system with a built in supply of food and a built-in bathroom with ventilation. Fertilized eggs are basically born with a little live cell from when it is laid, and, at this point, warmth from the nest and the brooding as well as oxygen that comes in through the pores of the eggshell help support the growing chick. Inside the egg, there is enough supply of nutrients for the chick to grow, and a waste disposal sac as well. In mammals, this is the job of the placenta and the mother. Carbon dioxide also passes through the pores in the eggshell. Eventually, the chick outgrows the shell, and is developed enough to hammer through it with it's beak. For the first few hours of life, there is enough of the food storage left from the egg to sustain the chick, connected to it's belly, called the yolk sac.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It looks like most of the question has been answered. But one thing I havent seen in the comments yet(might've just missed it), is that a bird egg is MUCH larger than a human egg. Human eggs are about 100 microns in diameter, or about as wide as a hair. It can barely be seen with the naked eye. Because of that, the embryo must develop with an attachment to the mother in order to receive nutrients. On the other hand, a bird egg is, well, about the size of a baby bird. It has enough room to carry all the nutrients needed for development without feeding from the mother.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
