		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Backstory: One of my bosses, let's call him Andy, is an extremely opinionated electrical engineer who has the answers for everything. Admittedly, he is actually really smart and can solve almost any work related issue we may have(we specialize in flow measurement) but is rarely challenged on some of his 'opinions' because it is a lot more work than it is worth.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Anyway, we have lots of random discussions at work and his new latest and greatest thought regarding nuclear waste disposal is: </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Andy: &quot;Well, it was radioactive and found in the ground before. Why not put it back when we are done with it?&quot;</p>
<p>Moonlapsed: &quot;Probably because it's a lot more concentrated after its refined&quot;</p>
<p>Andy: &quot;So just dilute it and spread it out like before&quot;</p>
<p>Moonlapsed: &quot;...&quot;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I did some google searching and I could not find any easy answers. My initial thought is the simple answer: he cannot be correct because if this were that simple it would likely be applied in the real world... right? Though I do not know 100% why, lol sigh.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This idea is actually similar to some forms of nuclear waste disposal that have been proposed and some forms that are being done for nuclear weapons waste disposal. There are a couple of problems with it though. Also it is important to remember that &quot;nuclear waste&quot; is a broad term that covers way too much stuff. A lot of radioactive waste from research and medicine is already disposed of in a similar (although not taken back to a mine) sort of <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/maps/radioactive-waste-sites.html" target="_blank">way</a></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The primary concern with nuclear waste it two parts: Firstly (and most importantly), the radio-toxicity of the material. When uranium is fissioned a bunch of different radioactive fission products can be generated. Over the course of the fuel lifetime all of these various products will be generated in different concentrations. Some of them have very short half-lives and will decay so fast that they are not a problem. Others have longer half-lives which makes them annoying. Among these longer half-lived fission products, some of them can easily dissolve in water and then concentrate in a human body if consumed (cesium and iodine being great examples). Those are the ones we are concerned about and want to trap. That is why current nuclear waste plants seal these fission products into very tough forms and then bury <a href="https://www.edf.fr/en/edf/radioactive-waste" target="_blank">them</a>. This prevents the bad stuff from (which wasn't in the uranium ore BTW) from finding its way into our water supply.  </p>
<p>The second big concern is fissile material. Nuclear reactors do not burn all of their fuel and actually breed some more fuel in the form of plutonium. We do not want this stuff to get into the wrong hands, so we either trap in in waste forms and bury it, reprocess the good stuff and use it <a href="http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/fuel-recycling/processing-of-used-nuclear-fuel.aspx" target="_blank">again</a>, or dilute it and bury <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-17-390" target="_blank">it</a> similar to what your boss proposed. This stuff is also toxic and we don't want it to get out into the environment, but the fission products are far worse. A third concern with dilution and burial is we then cannot easily get at the waste to pull more fuel out. The USA currently does not recycle our nuclear fuel and we have decades worth of usable fuel as &quot;waste&quot;. It would be stupid to bury that in a way that we couldn't easily get at it again.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>He is now wrong and it has been explored, but not in the way you would imagine.
The idea has been proposed to bury nuclear wast at the edge of tectonic plates where they are being pushed under another plate to be recycled into the mantle and effectively dissolved down to harmless levels.  Obviously this is a plan that needs million of years to go to fruition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know anything about nuclear waste, but I have worked in mining. There are a few issues, just from the mining perspective:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Spent fuel can't be put in its original location, because it came from an active mine. This might seem like nitpicking, but it isn't a trivial problem; we have to find somewhere to put millions of tons of rock that no one wants, which leads to the next issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have to acquire millions of tons of rock; we have to mine it, grind it, slurry it around -- basically we have to run a second mine. Given we have to find somewhere to dispose of the rock, we're probably going to be required to dilute it to background level or lower (assuming the waste is anything like uranium, which I don't know anything about). That is, for every ton of waste, we need 300,000 tons of rock, and the dilution rock mine is much bigger than the original mine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We're depositing slurry, not rock. Similar to point 1, we're deviating from &quot;put it back&quot; in a non-trivial way; slurry/tailings create environmental issues like leeching, dust control, rehabilitation, subsidence, etc. And we're not depositing this slurry underground because that has a whole new set of deal-breaking issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have to acquire water rights, and all the environmental permitting that goes along with depositing a bunch of slurry somewhere. So it sounds like this hypothetical location has a bunch of water, but is also worthless because we're using it solely as a dump.</p>
</li>
<li>The dilution facility has a conventional nuclear waste storage site because the waste has to be stored before dilution. Worse, it's not a very good one because it was selected to accommodate points 1-4.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are more issues, but I think this covers enough to prefer concentration to dilution. There's also the less technical issue of &quot;not in my backyard&quot;; instead of nuclear waste in a cave, we now have &quot;nuclear waste&quot; in a massive, open sand pile that's using a bunch of water, trucks, and milling -- and  includes a conventional nuclear waste storage facility.</p>
<p>Addendum: u/cowboylasers points out that nuclear waste has components that are highly soluble in water and bioaccumulate; this makes the dilution solution much, <em>much</em> worse (see point 3 &quot;leeching&quot;). It's why we have a problem with mercury, which is emitted from natural sources (volcanoes, ocean floor) and industrial sources (gold mining, coal, non-ferrous metals production) then absorbed by the ocean and accumulated in fish.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also important to note is that a large portion of the world’s uranium is not mined in what people think of as a conventional mine.  Even in underground operations workers never actually enter the areas the uranium is mined, and the area is backfilled immediately to prevent mine collapse and movement of groundwater. So you can’t roll in there to put anything back. </p>
<p>Uranium is almost always found along fault zones and in really graphite and clay-rich crumbly ground which is a bad start to looking for a stable place to store waste. Think more wet sandbox overtop of pasty toothpaste, that’s what most underground uranium mines are. Even the parts of the mine that the people can go in are unstable in the long term and not a good long term storage place.</p>
<p>And some uranium is mined by in-situ recovery which means it is dissolved from permeable rocks using a series of well-like drill holes. This actually makes the environment less contaminated than before mining. There is no government in the world that would let you pump the chemical you’d have to use to put solid nuclear waste back into suspension down into an aquifer, potable or not. </p>
<p>The current storage methods are sustainable for the foreseeable future, and like others have mentioned, allow people to recycle the fuel as technology advances.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
