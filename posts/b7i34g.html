I realize there are major historical discoveries that have happened there, but aren't there likely to be many archipelagos that are near a mainland that display the same amounts of natural selection and adaptive radiation?  Are they just the &quot;famous&quot; archipelago?  Is there a really unique situation there?  Or are people building upon 100+ years of research in that specific place?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's for a number of reasons. Largely because of the fact that the Galápagos is a volcanic landmass that was never connected to any continent. This means that all the species there had to migrate there, and there are no natural large predatory mammals, so they're able to survive there. Because of this, and because of how different the Galápagos landscape is compared to anywhere else, species were able to adapt in ways that we haven't seen before. There are many species there that can't be found anywhere else in the world. For instance, there's a native species of Iguana there that's adapted to aquatic life, which is something we've never seen from Iguanas. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a combination of being far from the mainland, and the actual islands being relatively far from eachother.  This is important for two main reasons:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>1: Because they're far from the mainland, and were never attached to a land mass, all animals on it migrated to the islands from one place or another.  This is important because such migrations are generally rare events, so any population of seed-animals was likely small and not refreshed by further immigrants from the mainland.  Because of this, we can assume that all of the similar varieties of sparrow there, for instance, came from the same root population.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Because there's a pretty good distance between the islands, this means that populations on one island -could- move to another, but it'd be relatively uncommon.  This helps to boost speciation since populations could move to all the islands over time, but a population on one island are relatively unlikely to mate with members of the original species they descended from.  This allowed distinctive species to evolve on each island as they interacted with that particular island's geography and population of flora and fauna.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what everyone's already said about biodiversity, consider one other aspect: the habitable zones. I count 11 different zones for unique species to inhabit in one small group of islands - that's pretty unique. Even considering Hawai'i, which has as many - but spread out over many more miles and islands. You can go from thermal vents to mountaintops in a matter of an hour, and everything you hit in between is going to be unique to each zone. Just another thought.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another reason is thanks to Darwin we have more data on what the Galápagos were like historically than other, similar island groups. This means we can conclude a lot more about how the islands are changing over time than we can in other places.
But also on a more general scale any isolated island systems are going to have unique diversity that is worth protecting because when it's gone, it's gone. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Added to what others have said, there's a study on the finches run be Peter and Rosemary Grant that has been going for decades. Their data explains how the certain species evolve in response to droughts and so on. I'd strongly recommend reading through some of their papers if you have any interest in evolutionary biology. The paper <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/2006/060710/full/news060710-11.html" target="_blank">this article</a> is based on is really good.</p>
<p>It's a sad reality that funding generally only lasts for a few years so projects that have been going for decades are a rarity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
