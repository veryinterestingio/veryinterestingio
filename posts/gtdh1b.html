In 2019 Victor Vescovo went 7 miles down into the water, and it is on the show Deep Planet on Discovery Channel. We just choose not to spend money to do it more often.   We have mapped the ocean floor, and have been to discrete parts of the ocean bottom, and we can explore anywhere we choose to get the money to investigate.  We just choose not to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

People don't really want to spend their money unless they are setting records (Mariana trench dive) or they are shipwreck diving for lost treasures (Billionaires hobby).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's mostly a scale thing really. The Earth's oceans are massive. We're perfectly capable of going down there, shining light and taking a picture. We do just that.</p>
<p>But just like how NASA is only recording an incredibly tiny sliver of everything that's out there in the universe, we're only recording a tiny bit of the deep sea every time we spend hundreds of thousands or millions on a research mission going down there.</p>
<p>And nature is wildly diverse. If you go out into the woods, stick your shovel in the ground and come home with a neat square foot of Earth, a couple of inches thick. There's a good chance that little sliver of topsoil contains thousands of scientifically unknown mites, nematodes, fungi, moulds and so on.</p>
<p>When we point a bit of our planet and say &quot;that's largely unknown!&quot; it's usually a combination of factors. The deep-sea is hard to reach and that makes it expensive to reach. There's not a lot of good reasons to go down there and that means few are willing to spend the millions it takes to fund a mission.</p>
<p>A lot of deep-sea discoveries are actually made through the maintenance robots of oil companies and companies maintaining the intercontinental cables. They're the people who have a reason to spend the money to go down there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Of course we <em>could</em>. There isn't just much to be gained. We know how the ocean floor generally looks geologically speaking, we just haven't bothered building a robot (or paying the money) to take high resolution pics of each square meter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difference between the 1 atmosphere of pressure at sea level and the 0 atmospheres of pressure in space is much easier to overcome than the difference between the 1 atmosphere at sea level and the hundreds of atmospheres in the ocean (~1100 atmospheres at the bottom of the Mariana's trench). Also space is transparent so we can point cameras at it. Water blocks light after just a few meters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
