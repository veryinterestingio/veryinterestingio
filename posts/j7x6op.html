		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A light source &quot;illuminates&quot; an area by essentially sending out light rays (photons). Those rays hit surfaces, get partially absorbed then bounce back carrying the surface's color with them. For this to work well you need a lot of rays hitting the same area and bouncing back to your eye.</p>
<p>The farther away from the source you are the less dense the rays are (imagine a shotgun blast opening up as it flies out).</p>
<p>Less rays means that there are very few chances enough of them will bounce off the same surface and back into your eye to carry the color. As a result your surrounding aren't &quot;illuminated&quot;.</p>
<p>However, nothing is preventing the couple stray rays from hitting you straight in the eyeball.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Absorption and scattering. </p>
<p>Unless your location is a perfect white, some of the light hitting it will be absorbed, reducing its intensity. </p>
<p>Then, unless your location is a perfect mirror perfectly angled to redirect the light to your eye, the light is scattered in every direction, further reducing its intensity. </p>
<p>The light <em>is</em> still illuminating your location, and if you could somehow turn off all the other lights illuminating your location, turn around to look away from the last distant street light, wait a while for your eyes to adjust, and then start flipping that streetlight on and off you should be able to see a difference (depending on just how far away the streetlight is). </p>
<p>But in the real world, turning off all other sources of light isn't really possible, most of the time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Missing from this explanation so far is also a mention of just how amazing the eye is. Your retina cells can detect single individual photons. So even at great distances we can see lights shining, even if only a few of those photons make it to our eye. However there are not enough photons making it to the area to illuminate, which requires them bouncing off the surroundings, and not being absorbed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine it is dark and you shine a torch at the wall. The light spreads out like a cone, getting more spread the further it gets from the torch.   Some of the light hits the wall . Some gets absorbed by the paint and some gets bounced back. Some of that light hits you eye and that's how you see. If you shine at a mirror a lot gets bounced back. If the wall is black less gets bounced back.</p>
<p>Ok so that's reflected light. Each time it hits something only a fraction gets reflected/scattered back.</p>
<p>If your twin shines the same torch from a mile away at  you, then the light that hits your eye hasn't hit anything between the torch and your eye. That is direct light. Your eyes are sensitive and if everything else is dark then your eye will notice the one light even if it is far away.</p>
<p>It's the same reason that looking at the sun will burn your eyes ( never do this ) . Direct sunlight is really really strong  . But if it's sunlight that's bouncing off a tree or a person then most if the light is absorbed and scattered so then it's ok and your eye can even distinguishes which bits of light it sees. Red...blue...etc.</p>
<p>The absorption of light is why thing get hot when left in direct summer sunlight, more so than when they are in the shade and only get reflected light</p>
<p>Our sun is a star that's very close. Other stars are a long way away but we can still see them even when it's dark.</p>

I haven't really studied much physical science since high school and that was a while ago so pardon my ignorance on the subject. I just had the question occur to me while I was outside this evening, and Google wasn't much help. You all were though!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
