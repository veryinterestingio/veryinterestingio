		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I've competed in 7 competitions, including US Nationals 2017 and just want to add to the previous answers. Not every competitor will have the exact same scramble. Most competitions are divided into several rounds, and each round is divided into different &quot;heats&quot; So let's say that there's 3 rounds of 3x3 (Which is a regular rubik's cube). Round 1 may have 5 heats of 20 competitors. Round 2 may have 5 heat's of 10 competitors, and so on. Each heat has their own set of scrambles. This is done so that when the first 20 people are done they can't go and tell the next 20 people about the scramble. I'll try my best to answer any other questions people have, or go to worldcubeassociation.org</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've competed in 25 competitions and have been part of the organising team for 15 of those in the past 3 years, so I have a fair bit of experience.</p>
<p>There are 18 events/disciplines held in competitions, including 2×2 - 7×7, but for the sake of this answer, I'm only going to be focusing on the 3×3.</p>
<p>Where I live, there are on average 100 people who compete in 3×3 per competition, so they are divided into 10 groups of 10 people each.
Also, there are 5 solves per person, per round.
If group 1 is called out, everyone in that group submits their cube and it's taken to the scrambling table where there are two scramblers, who set up the cube exactly as a computer - generated scramble sheet says, for that solve number.</p>
<p>For ex - If I'm in group 5, I submit my cube in a box that has my scoresheet in it after the first 4 groups have already finished. Then it is taken to the scrambling table where they scramble it according to the solve I am on, and it is given to my judge and my name is called out. I then go to solve and after the solve is done, the time is written down on the scoresheet and both me and the judge sign it to verify that it's correct.
Then it's taken back to the scrambling table for the exact same procedure 4 more times, but with different scrambles, and everyone in the group will do those exact same scrambles in the exact same order, unless there are some unforeseen circumstances, like if they got distracted during a solve, they would then get an extra scramble for that attempt, but the rest of their solves would be done according to the scrambles everyone else got for those solves.</p>
<p>Also, scrambles are different for each group to prevent cheating, as someone in group 1 could easily explain part of the scrambles to someone in group 2, had they been using the same scrambles.</p>
<p>I hope that answers your question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Each competitor's cube will in fact be scrambled the same way. </p>
<p>There is a system of notation for the various moves that can be done on a Rubik's cube; e.g., &quot;turn the top layer 90 degrees counterclockwise&quot; is U', or &quot;turn the left side 180 degrees&quot; is L2. A computer program will generate a more-or-less random scramble and, using the notation, provide the sequence of moves necessary to reach that scramble from a solved cube.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok so not sure if you'll understand this analogy, but here goes. There is speed cubing, where you try and solve the cube in as little time as possible. This can be analogous to speed running in video games. Is there such a thing as trying to solve a scramble in as few moves as possible? It's sort of like how in strategy games there are low turn clear challenges where players figure out how to beat the game in as few turns as possible. It's not time sensitive like a real-time attack speed run but instead emphasizes more about planning than anything else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
