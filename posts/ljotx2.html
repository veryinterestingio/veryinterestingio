		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mutations are random, but there are variables that can help a mutation catch on. For example, infections that are short lived aren't as likely to bread a mutation as long lived infections. Your immune system killing everything pretty quick putts a real damper on creating, growing, and spreading a mutant. Specifically, someone who was immuno-compramised, allowing the Covid infection to survive in their body for an exceptionally long time is believed to be the source of one of the new mutations. It's possible more of the mutations were bread in a similar way but just not traced to patent x.</p>
<p>Edit: here's my source: <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210127-covid-19-variants-how-mutations-are-changing-the-pandemic" target="_blank">https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210127-covid-19-variants-how-mutations-are-changing-the-pandemic</a></p>
<p>&quot;The working hypothesis is that this happened in a chronically infected individual,&quot; says Gupta. There have been at least two cases of H69/V70 deletions occurring alongside other mutations in patients who have been chronically ill with Covid-19 – one in an elderly woman in Moscow, Russia, and the man in Cambridge, UK.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Both had received treatment for cancer which is thought to have reduced the ability of their immune systems to fight off Covid-19. Because the patients were infected for so long, the virus had time to replicate to high levels in their bodies and accumulate mutations. When the patients were given antibody therapy, those versions of the virus that were better able to escape or outpace the treatment survived.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We don't know where this might have happened yet with B117, but in long-term infections the virus has a chance of fighting off a bit of genetic pressure from a treatment,&quot; adds Gupta.</p>
<p>Edit 2: PSA always finish your anti-biotic prescription for this very reason.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>any organism, that has genetic material that must be copied to create new cells or be kept intact to keep those cells alive, will mutate. Radiation and other environmental stressors cause damage. Heck, even expressing that DNA as RNA can cause cellular stress due to supercoiling and torsional strain in combination with the other stressors.</p>
<p>As such mutations will arise always. It’s guaranteed.</p>
<p>Now, how fast they arise, that’s due to these extrinsic forces that damage dna and intrinsic forces that fix dna. These intrinsic forces are properties of dna itself (like its sequence of a,t,g, and c’s) and the enzymatic properties of the proteins coded for by that dna.</p>
<p>In the case of a pathogen that has some of its own proteins and also needs some of its host’s proteins, at a basic level it is POSSIBLE (aka. Conceivable) that some mutations in the host will impact the mutation rate of the pathogen.</p>
<p>However, one has to differentiate between the TRUE mutation rate of the pathogen and the OBSERVED mutation rate. We’ve been talking about the True mutation rate thus far: what’s the idealized scenario. The observed mutation rate, we will detect may be bigger than the true mutation rate: eg if a mutated form grows better than a nonmutated form, if we aren’t careful, we will bias our interpretation of this observation. So experiments have to be carefully planned to ensure we are approximating the true mutation rate and not biasing our observations to just the survivors of our immune systems.</p>
<p>We know that some pathogens like malaria replicate less well in people who have sickle cell trait. This is an example of a host mutation affecting growth but not the mutation rate of pathogen. Let’s say a virus uses a proofreading enzyme of its host to help it prevent mutations in its own genome, then mutations that negatively impact the host and that could give rise to things like cancer could conceivably alter the capacity of a virus to mutate. But it’s very complicated and hard to study in humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some answers here, but nothing that exactly answers your question, i feel.</p>
<p>Viruses usually encode in their genome a polymerase - that's the enzyme that reads a template strand of genome and makes a duplicate.  The polymerases we (humans) have are pretty good at making faithful copies, and have error rates of maybe 1:100,000.  The viral polymerases are way worse, with an error rate of maybe 1:1000 (it varies depending on virus type).  When viruses infect a cell, the viral polymerase takes over making lots and lots of viral genome, and in the process starts making lots and lots of mutations.</p>
<p>Importantly, some mutations cause that virus to become deactivated, while others cause the virus to change in subtle ways.  Some mutations may be in the viral enzymes, and some may be in the coat proteins.  When it's the coat proteins (the outside spikes, in the case of CoV2) that can change the way they look to the cell.  In a simplified view, the antibodies generated from one virus then could, potentially, not recognise the other.</p>
<p>Lastly, the number of mutations you're likely to get is related to the number of infections, since, in a pandemic, there are many more opportunities for mutations to be introduced into the viral genome. The host comes into play, only in a broad sense, that human immune systems apply a particular type of pressure that may fight off certain types of mutation, and struggle more with others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>University lecturer in biology checking in, because there are a couple of key points that haven't been addressed in any of the answers I've seen (and at least one of them contains incorrect information).</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Mutations happen by random chance. Some viruses have higher mutation rates due to the type of genome they use (DNA vs. RNA). The host may affect mutation rates to some degree, but probably only slightly and indirectly.</strong></p>
<p>First off, mutations in any organism are simply the result of random errors that happen while the genome is being copied (the wrong nucleotide gets put into place the growing DNA chain). To give you an idea of how rare this is, DNA replication in humans has an error rate of roughly one per <em>billion</em> base pairs copied.</p>
<p>Most of the time, these mutations don't lead to anything at all happening, because the resulting gene cannot be translated into a functional protein. But on very rare occasions, the mutation may actually lead to a new or altered protein. Even in the vast majority of these cases, however, the new or altered protein will not be beneficial and will be removed from the population by natural selection. It's only in the doubly rare case that a random mutation happens to produce a new trait just happens by random luck to be beneficial that it will be selected for by natural selection and will become more common in the population.</p>
<p>Viruses aren't technically organisms because they aren't technically alive, but it works the same way with them. With at least one very noteworthy exception that applies to <em>some</em> viruses, including the one that causes COVID-19: some viruses don't have genomes made of DNA, but instead have genomes made of RNA. This is significant because the enzymes involved in copying RNA are less stable, meaning that when an RNA-based virus copies its genome the error rate, and hence the mutation rate, is much higher. Couple that with an extremely short viral replication cycle, and you have a recipe for very rapid evolution.</p>
<p>This is why you have to get a new flu vaccine every year, but the measles vaccine has remained relatively unchanged for decades; influenza viruses are RNA-based viruses, while the measles virus is a DNA-based virus and therefor has a much slower rate of mutation. However here it's also important to note another factor slowing the evolution of the measles virus, which is that it's been nearly eradicated in developed nations. The fewer hosts a virus infects, the less it can be reproduced and the fewer chances there are for mutation. <em>This</em> is why it's so important to get the COVID-19 vaccines distributed as quickly as possible: the longer we wait, the more the virus will mutate in the meantime and the more new variants we will have to deal with.</p>
<p>To answer your second question, regarding whether the host has anything to do with it, the answer (as far as I know) is &quot;kinda, but not really&quot;. People with weaker immune systems, or people that are for whatever reason more susceptible to the virus, may have more severe or longer lasting infections that allow for more viral reproduction. Since mutation happens by random chance, the higher the volume of viral reproduction, the higher the odds of mutation occurring. The fever generated by the body's immune system may also play a role in it, as viral reproduction is <em>highly</em> affected by even slight variations in temperature (this is why your body produces a fever in the first place, to impede viral reproduction). So if different individuals respond to the virus with different levels of fever, that could also potentially play a role in affecting mutation rate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
