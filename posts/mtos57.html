		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the short answer (being &quot;how&quot;) is actually relatively simple; their tongues are so large and complex that they can use them to produce exceptionally distinct sound waves, reproducing not only human speech patterns, but the patterns of animals. Hell, any sound really, as there's been cases of domesticated parrots mimicking household appliances.   </p>
<p>As to &quot;why,&quot; the answer gets a bit more complicated. What's known for certain, and this is true with many species of avians, is that they have to learn or adjust to the 'local' mating call to find a mate. Imagine, if you would, you travel to a new country and now have to mimic their accent to even be seen as a viable mate, or even human. Weird, but that's how birds work particularly when their mating calls are from a distance. </p>
<p>Aspects of mimicry outside of mating are a bit theoretical, as it can be assumed to be bonding/play, or simple attempts at communication. </p>
<p>Hope that helped.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some birds can learn to mimic the sounds of other birds and even humans. If a bird can learn to imitate a sound, they can copy the sounds others make.</p>
<p>Scientists wondered why some birds can learn to imitate sounds and others cannot. The new study found that parrotsâ€™ brains have special areas for learning and remembering sounds. Like parrots, birds that can learn to imitate sounds have brains with special learning areas. Birds that cannot learn to imitate sounds do not have these special learning areas. The special learning areas in the brains of birds that can learn to imitate sounds are called a core and a shell. The core is in the front of the brain. The shell is in the back. </p>
<p>Scientists think that this is because birds that can imitate sounds learn to copy sounds before they learn to fly. It may be that in birds that can learn to imitate sounds, the core and shell were duplicated a long time ago and have changed very little since then.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
