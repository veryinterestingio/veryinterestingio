		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In sofar as the infertility in the first place was due to genetic factors (instead of hormonal, behavioral reasons for example), and that specific to the treatment and to the offspring's genotype there is a high likelihood of those &quot;infertility genes&quot; being transmitted and expressed.  I don't think the question is well-defined or meaningful because fertility treatment could mean egg and sperm from fertile parents were transplanted in the mother, in which case the child will most likely be fertile as well, at least from the genetic point of view.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Infertility can be due to a variety of causes. It's not always genetic.</p>
<p>Anovulation due to PCOD can cause infertility. Ovulation induction and weight loss will help. </p>
<p>Pelvic inflammatory disease can cause uterine adhesions and tubal blockade where adhesiolysis can be done</p>
<p>Cystic fibrosis affected males are infertile. While affected females are fertile</p>
<p>Kalmann syndrome can cause infertility in both males and females. </p>
<p>And so much more conditions. While genetic diseases can be passed down to children and cause infertility, preventable causes are much more common. Every other woman has PCOD these days. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One common side effect of chemotherapy is infertility. As a result typically young males are strongly recommended to make a deposit for later use.</p>
<p>Since my chemo there's a strong risk I'm infertile, however any children I have through IVF wouldn't be because of the elemental factor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While infertility itself is not inherited genetically that we know of, the reason for infertility in a mother may play a role in the development of infertility in her offspring. There have been some studies (both animal and human) that are beginning to link in utero hormone exposure to infertility. One example I found: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0035-5" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0035-5</a> </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is like all the previous posters said, it depends. Infertility is a far reaching condition that entails multitudes of possible diagnoses. </p>
<p>If it is environmental, etc then no. It is important to note though that women and their fertility can experience a sharp drop after the age of 35. For example, if the fallopian tubes are lost in an ectopic pregnancy, there’s not a genetic basis and it won’t get passed on. Louise Brown naturally conceived her first child.</p>
<p>If the husband has a genetic basis (micro deletion, etc) for infertility and he has a son, yes, it will potentially get passed on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
