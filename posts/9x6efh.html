		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am imagining minecraft, so this is probably a stupid question. But if I went to my backyard and got a shovel, how far would I go before I hit stone? Or is there even stone under? Earth science in high school covered types of rocks and and layers n stuff, but doesn't tell us where things are.</p>
<p>Are the tectonic plates made of rock? The education system has failed me, please help</p>
<p>E: so from what I'm getting - my education on earth science sucked. I loved physics and biology (chemistry sucked), but my &quot;earth science&quot; class was just &quot;here are types of rocks. Here are the planets, good luck&quot;. From what I understand- it varies, bedrock isnt under 60+meters of stone as some childhood video games led me to believe, but could be 10-40ft below dirt. I think in my area, there is clay under me (my dad dug 6' holes for fence posts, and only got thick red stuff [probably clay]). </p>
<p>Thank you for all the help, I was up late at night and semi delerious when I got on this thought path, but I appreciate you all taking the time to answer :)</p></div></div>

<p>I went to a Bellevue, WA College (BC) where our class talked about how Bellevue is a mess from tectonic activity, got to see a couple local caves and then found out dirt can go down 5-30' in some places before generally turning to clay and then under that sand and rocks. I confirmed the dirt layer at home when my sceptic tank broke and I had to dig 6-7' deep trenches. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Soil composition varies greatly from area to area. </p>
<p>Around here dirt may give way to sand or clay within 30 to 50 feet. There's a possibility of finding gravel mixed within.</p>
<p>Below the sand/ gravel  or clay layer is limestone usually within 80 or so feet.</p>
<p>I used to work with a man who drilled water wells. He had samples from all over the area in glass jars. He marked them with the road and the depth. When someone came to inquire about price he would show them the samples from their area and tell them what he expected to find.</p>
<p>The formations are different in the other end of the county. He would show those people the samples from that area. </p>
<p>There were 5 lakes which were formed by glacial activity during the last ice age. Around here the answer to your question would depend upon what the glacier did.</p>
<p>I would suggest talking with a well driller or a geologist from your area.</p>
<p>Some places it's well over 100 feet to bedrock and in other places the bedrock is exposed on the surface.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The depth to bedrock varies dramatically, both on a local scale (like going from a hilltop to a valley bottom) or on a global or continental scale. You can check the <a href="https://soilgrids.org/#!/?layer=TAXNWRB_250m" target="_blank">SoilGrids website</a> and turn on the layer called &quot;Absolute depth to bedrock (in cm)&quot; under the &quot;Site characteristics&quot; section. That's just a modeled estimate of soil depth, but it should give you some idea of the scale and variability and a bit about what's going on in your particular part of the world.</p>
<p>Soil is not uniform as it goes down, though. Organic matter content decreases and fine particulates increase. There's also usually not a hard boundary between soil and bedrock in most places. Inbetween is a layer called saprolite, which is weathered, broken down bedrock. Basically gravel that becomes larger and larger until it's more like fractured bedrock. Eventually there's an impermeable layer of bedrock somewhere down there, but it might be an order of magnitude deeper than the commonly quoted &quot;depth to bedrock&quot; in some cases.</p>
<p>Ultimately the tectonic plates are indeed made of rock. Generally granitic rocks in the case of continental crust and mafic basalts in the case of oceanic crust. These can be overlain with other rocks locally in come cases, though, either because of volcanics, sedimentary deposition and later lithification, or accretion from another plate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OABCR is the denotion of soil horizons: organic, surface, subsoil, substrate amd bedrock. Organic is the layer of organic material <em>with little</em> decay. Substrate has majority of organic material and benthic life, and has little clay minerals. Subsoil we get lots of iron amd clay minerals. Substrate is also known as the leeching layer where theres heavy weathering of parent rock. Finally we get bedeock, the mass that a soil profile is stratified on top of.</p>
<p>On average a soil horizon is 8 to 12 feet before bedrock, with huge variability on location. If you live in a grain belt like heartland America where you have millennia of aluvial deposits  (river deposits) it can be much greater than 12 ft to hit bedrock. Live in the mountains maybe inches. Active volcanism, or places that have been weathered completely away have no soil profile. Consult www.usgs.gov to learn more about your areas geology.</p>
<p>Also, eventually, get deep enough and bedrock changes. Currently South Africa (I believe) has the deepest mine. Its not deep enough for where I'm describing but deeper than we can drill heat and pressure break down subducting oceanic plate and the undersides pf continental crust. Deeper yet theres the moho and the asthenosphere layer which you can read about.</p>
<p>I'm glad to try and answer any further questions, I'm a geology student close to finishing so anything I can't answer I can easily <em>get</em> the answer from texts and professors. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
