		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a bunch of microscopic specialized doctors and soldiers your body has that repair and protect any openings in your skin no matter how big or small. They're just rushing to the opening all at once to fight back any bad germs that want to get in, keeping any good germs in, and then fixing your skin one itty-bitty piece at a time.</p>
<p>The doctors and soldiers are made and released from special factories inside of your bones. But they use your blood as roads to commute to and from work but also to respond quickly to an emergency on your skin. </p>
<p>Edit: where they come from.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Wow! Front page! Congrats u/gregc97 ! And thank you all for getting him there! </p>
<p>Thank you anonymous redditors for the Gold and Silver! This has completely made my day!</p>
<p>I have just gotten a small taste of RIP inbox. It's a thing. I will try to reply to all of you on my lunch break. Shout out to  Dinty Moore Beef Stew!</p>
<p>2 things have come up repeatedly: apparently I explained Pus whereas OP was wondering about plasma. I thoroughly apologize for not being accurate. Someone ELI5 plasma? And second, apparently an anime by the name of Cells at Work needs to be on my watch list. I'll add it to my queue. It seems interesting.</p>
<p>In the mean time, be excellent to each other!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you pop a pimple, which is a tiny infection, you’re seeing the fluids that carry the white blood cells that are fighting the infection in your skin. </p>
<p>It’s cellular fluids and lymphocytes as well as other white blood cells. When the body is damaged or invaded by a microbe, the body’s alarm system, messenger cells (T cells) to alert the fighters (white blood cells) to take care of business. (Some T cells also fight invaders directly.)</p>
<p>It comes from the lymphatic system. A series of vessels that connect to our organs and blood vessels. </p>
<p>(The lymph itself is produced by in the blood cell producers in your bone marrow.)</p>
<p>That’s why you see clear fluid when you clear pus from a wound. </p>
<p>Edit: Thanks to everyone who had something to add. I took cellular anatomy in the early 2000’s and could use a refresher. </p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's all part of the same stuff! Your blood is composed of 4 parts. Serum (clear, thin fluid), clotting factor, serum with clotting factor makes up what is called your blood plasma, the liquid portion of your blood essentially, the other 2 things are the solid parts of your blood. The red blood cells(RBCs) and the leukocytes or white blood cells. </p>
<p>RBCs are how your body transmits oxygen through your circulatory system, and leukocytes make up your badass immune system.</p>
<p>When clotting factor and RBCs are exposed to air, they bundle up into a clot that blocks flow of most things out of your body, but some serum can still leak through typically.</p>
<p>Additionally, your body will just send water to an inflamed area, much as you'd find in a blister or swelling in any part of your body. This is basically the same material as the tears in your eyes, and can also leak out of a wound such as a popped pimple.</p>
<p>Edit: as per u/newtothelyte and his/her correction, removed platelets from part of clotting factor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interstitial fluid. It's not just water or sweat. Can come initially or after further picking. Contains coagulation factors to kick off a specific clotting pathway involved with tissue damage. Probably contains certain immunological components too to protect you from infection. </p>
<p>Important for blood taking because it'll dilute your chemistry results and give abnormal coagulation times.</p>
<p>Edit: holy guacamole my first medal. Thank you stranger! I accept this award with great humility</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That &quot;clear liquid&quot; is called interstitial fluid. Blood vessels are purposly a little leaky because it allows things like vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, fats, and all other things your cells need to get to them. Think of it as your blood vessels are a road but there are no driveways to the cells so everything that has to get to them has to go off roading.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
