<p>Hairstyling demonstrates relatively sophisticated tool use, even if it's just using a sharp rock. It's generally a social activity and the emergence of gendered hairstyles (beyond just male facial hair) might provide evidence for a culture with more complex behavior and gender roles. Most importantly, it seems like the sort of thing that could actually be resolved from cave paintings or artifacts or human remains found in ice, right? </p>
<p>What kind of evidence do we have demonstrating that early hominids groomed their hair?</p></div></div>

<p>That depends on what you mean by sohpisticated, but not all styling requires tools.</p>
<p>Styles like mudding of the hair, or &quot;dredding&quot; of the hair, that we still see in African tribal cultures don't require tools, and are likely some of the earliest &quot;styling&quot; technologies, though I'm not sure there's much evidence to back up that claim.  </p>
<p>Braids and rope are essentially the same technology; they don't require tools although combs make them easier.  I can imagine them developing before carved or constructed combs, since the human hand can suffice as a rudimentary comb, as could an antler.  We have debatable evidence of braids from about 30,000 years ago, in Austria, with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_of_Willendorf" target="_blank">Venus of Willendorf</a> and about 25,000 years ago with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_of_Brassempouy" target="_blank">Venus of Brassempouy.</a>  But early hominids would be mostly if not completely gone by this time, making extrapolation difficult.</p>
<p>Burning is another technology applied to hair styling that could be an early development in the same era fire production was being cultivated.  It wouldn't require additional tool development beyond  fire-making, and could have been used by early hominids with the tech for carrying fire.</p>
<p>Shaving and hair cutting could have come with just the simplest stone tools, near the very beginning of tool use in hominids.  But it's difficult to attribute.  Even the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Châtelperronian" target="_blank">Châtelperronian industry</a> is still controversial, though we do have some evidence that the tools and body ornamentation happening there was related to Neanderthals.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/09/160920090400.htm" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/09/160920090400.htm</a></p>
<p>We have unearthed fairly sophisticated hair combs in Africa around 5000 BCE, and can probably push their development back a bit in time, but how distant would be a guess.</p>
<p>A lot of information we have about early homind lifestyle is happening with chemical analysis of food proteins left on teeth, pollen analysis, and something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide_mass_fingerprinting" target="_blank">Peptide Mass Fingerprinting</a> for rapid detection of hominid remains.  It's teaching us a hell of a lot about neaderthals.  But it's really deep analysis of such ephemeral residues, there remain limits to our reach into the past.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What is the connection between the biological need to cut hair and the cultural ability to do so?</p>
<p>Other great apes and chimps seem to lack the cultural acuity and tool skills to cut hair, but they also don't have the biological need to. Human head hair, if uncut, will grow very long - well down our backs. Other apes don't have this issue, their head hair is short like their body hair. So they have no need to cut hair.</p>
<p>Is there any way of knowing which came first? Did our biology prompt our need to develop tools to cut hair? Or did our tool use ease evolutionary pressure to have short hair, even encourage pressure to have long hair, and actually influence our evolution and biology?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Suggests that really long hair evolved after humans left Africa, so that would be 60,000 years ago. At that point we were essentially already modern humans, so haircutting has probably existed as long as long hair has.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
