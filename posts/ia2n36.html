Difference in cost between running one and 1000 is minimal. So if you can make one, why not make 1000? Even if each one only generates the equivalent of 10 cents of profit a day, that's 100$ a day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are scams. They promise nude pics or sex shows and then ask for your credit card to 'prove' you are of age. They can then rip you off for whatever they want. The reason it is profitable is because a single person can run hundreds of these scams and there is very little stopping them from just starting up immediately again if they are banned. International laws are difficult, so if they target outside their home country, what can any of us do?</p>
<p>On top of that, the obvious nature of these scams act as a passive filter because only gullible or desperate marks are willing to try these sorts of things, and they are more likely to pay up or not actively try to report any issues.</p>
<p>They also can use these scams to get intimate photos of people and then blackmailing them for more cash, or they can use it to trick you into giving away personal info they can exploit or sell. I think in the case of these sex bots, however, the main focus in automating them to lead you to the 'credit card for age verification' scam.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
