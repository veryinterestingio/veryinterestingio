		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Router:</strong> Directs network traffic based on destination addresses and preset rules. These are usually situated between gateways/modems and switches.</p>
<p><strong>Switch:</strong> These devices simply connect multiple devices together, sort of like a splitter. Although managed switches can do quite a bit more, such as create VLAN's, which can help organize and protect network traffic.</p>
<p><strong>Gateway:</strong> These are often times mistakenly referred to as modems or routers. They are devices that connect a private network to the internet. However they can also just be a device that connects one private network to a larger private network. A residential gateway is likely the device you have at home that connects you to the internet.</p>
<p><strong>Hub:</strong> These are essentially the dumb versions of switches. They function like repeaters, so when a computer talks on the network, the hub will broadcast that message to every port on the hub. If the message reaches the target PC, then that PC will do the same. This is a very inefficient method, which is why hubs are obsolete. Switches contain memory, so they remember which PC is on which port, and will direct messages to the correct port without having to constantly broadcast to all ports.</p>
<p><strong>Bridge:</strong> A network bridge joins two networks together. Such as one PC sharing the network connection with other PC's. Things like transparent bridges create a seamless link, these are often times used by security devices such as firewalls. They will inspect network traffic and block anything that violates the rules.</p>
<p><strong>Modem:</strong> A device that converts network traffic into a format that can be used on the media that connects you to the internet; Whether that be fiber, coaxial cable, 3G/4G wireless signals, or a copper phone line.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: What you have at home, which is often times referred to as a 'Wireless router', or just a 'router', is actually a combination of a lot of these devices. They are indeed routers, but also switches, wireless access points, and sometimes modems/gateways. If it contains a modem, it can be referred to as a residential gateway, if it doesn't, then it's a wireless router. Small businesses will often use these same devices, but larger businesses will use enterprise class hardware, where these devices are separate and usually mounted in an equipment rack.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit: Network traffic broken into packets, which you can think of like a letter in an envelope.  The letter is your data (like a Google query) and the envelope has a 'to' and 'from' line to help know how to forward it on.  All those devices have different techniques for knowing how and where to forward an envelope onto, once they get it.</p>
<p><strong>Hub:</strong> Make a copy of a letter and give it to every one of your neighbors with a t-shirt cannon, whether you meant to give it to them or not</p>
<p><strong>Switch:</strong> Make a copy of your letter and use a map to drive it to a specific neighbor</p>
<p><strong>Bridge:</strong> When you want to give a letter to Billy the next neighborhood over, so you give it to his brother who lives right in-between the two neighborhoods</p>
<p><strong>Router:</strong> Send your letter to the post office, and they'll send it to your grandma by forwarding it to her post office and then driving it to her house using a map</p>
<p><strong>Gateway:</strong> The post office in your neighborhood</p>
<p><strong>Modem:</strong> Send your letter to the post office by saying it over the phone to a postal worker, where they type and print it off and forward it on</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hub: Everybody yells in your house whenever they want something, it sucks, plus now everyone knows everyone else's business. Nobody yells anymore, hubs are bad.</p>
<p>Switch: If you want to yell at someone in your house, you go to them and yell at them, nobody else hears it. To yell back at you, they come to you. This is awesome but still local and indoors.</p>
<p>Router: You want to yell at your neighbor but don't care where he is, these take the noise and pass it around all the way to his ears.</p>
<p>Bridge: It's like that door that connects two rooms in a hotel so the family can yell at each other.</p>
<p>Modem: It converts the yelling into electricity so your yelling can travel far and reach your neighbor (you don't know/care where he is, see router above)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best way to imagine these concepts is to imagine the old telephone system back in the day where we used to have actual human switch board operators.</p>
<p>Firstly, imagine everyone in your neighborhood had a telephone, and they were all physically wired together.  Sure, you could reach anyone in your neighborhood but only one person would be able to speak at a time, and everyone who was on the phone would hear every conversation even if they weren't involved.  And everyone would have to try to compete for talking time on the same line.  This is a HUB.</p>
<p>Now imagine that everyone in your neighborhood has a phone, but instead of them all being physically wired together, they all go to the central telephone company office.  When you pick up the phone, you reach the operator at the central office.  You then tell the operator who you're trying to call and they connect your call using a wire between your phone line and the recipient's phone line on a switchboard.  This is a SWITCH, since they are 'switching' your call to the recipients line.  Multiple people can use their phone lines at the same time without having to wait their turn to speak on a shared line, and nobody else is subjected to your conversation.  Only the 3 parties are involved; caller, operator, and recipient.</p>
<p>The simplest definition of a bridge is that it physically connects devices on a network.  So in the previous example, the wire that the operator used to connect your call?  That's a BRIDGE.  So both hubs and switches are technically types of bridges because they physically connect the phones together.  However, in most cases, a bridge is used to connect physically diverse networks (think electrical &lt;-&gt; fiber optic, or wired connection &lt;-&gt; wireless connection).</p>
<p>This is all fine and dandy, but what happens when you want to call someone in a different neighborhood?  Sure, we could connect all of the neighborhoods together into one big switchboard but that would get messy.  When you reach the operator and tell them you want to connect your call to someone in a different neighborhood, they will route your call outside of the local telco office for your neighborhood over a network to the operator at the local telco office of the person you're trying to reach.  Your operator, and any operator in the network between them and the destination operator are now acting as a ROUTER.</p>
<p>Now let's say for some reason you were in a neighborhood that was still stuck with telegraphs and didn't have phones yet.  But the person you're trying to reach doesn't have a telegraph, and even if they did, doesn't know morse code.  So you telegraph your operator, who then translates your telegraph into speech and carries on the conversation for you, and translates the replies back into morse code and transmits them back.  Your operator is now acting as a MODEM.  A modem is also an example of a bridge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Router = A call center phone system where everyone can only be reached through an extension from the main line.</p>
<p>Hub= a friggin mega phone. Literally.. Imagine every phone call received by a call center just get blasted out on the entire floor.</p>
<p>Switches=Everyone gets his own direct phone line in a call center.</p>
<p>Bridge=Two completely different physical call center locations using the same main phone line.</p>
<p>Modem=Modem is more like a translator. It's a magical translation machine that can turn all the calls from Japanese speakers into English.</p>
<p>That's the best ELI5 I can think of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
