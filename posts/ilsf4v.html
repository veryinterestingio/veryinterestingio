		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good observation! Thishappens because of two different effects interacting with each other, so I'll tackle each part individually.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I often find if I'm tired on a hot and humid day, I find it very easy to drift off into sleep</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is because, as a warm-blooded creature, you produce your own heat (versus, say, a lizard that moves from hot rock to hot rock to get heat). Having the right amount of heat is super important for maintaining healthy body chemistry and if your insides get too hot or too cold (it's a super narrow range, 98F +/- ~1), systems in your body start malfunctioning and you develop serious health issues (and die, if not corrected). Endotherms generate their heat as a by-product of all the chemistry that happens in them, almost by accident (think about how a car engine gets hot). So when you're too warm on a hot day, your brain automatically turns down your metabolism (makes your chemistry less active, less frequent) so the environmental heat doesn't overload you. </p>
<p>So, on a hot day, you feel tired because your body is making less energy that you can actually use (like how it feels after exercise, when you're &quot;spent&quot;) and even alters neuro-signaling to encourage laziness (since physical activity produces a lot of heat!). It's all in an attempt to prevent overheating and internal damage (like how a car's pistons can start to melt if the engine runs too hot, breaking the car).</p>
<p>Now for the 2nd part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>that your body needs to reduce in temperature to sleep properly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a bit less understood, but known well enough for an answer on this sub. It's not so much that &quot;colder&quot; temperatures are better for sleep, but rather that &quot;not as hot&quot; temperatures are. You've got something called a &quot;circadian rhythm&quot; that helps establish a routine for your body (when to be awake, when to start getting tired, when to sleep, etc). Think of it as...something like a tide, ebb and flow, of chemical reactions. Reaction A makes more chemicals for Reaction B while getting rid of the stuff for Reaction C, then B does the same (makes fuel for C, gets rid of fuel for A), and so on (where A promotes being awake and C promotes being asleep and B is tired). And it's sensitive to stuff like food, light levels, noise, activity, and temperature.</p>
<p>Turns out that many of the molecular pathways that are responsible for controlling sleep are also sensitive to temperature changes. And because of a strong correlation in the natural world of light with temperature (more light = hotter), a higher internal body temperature when trying to sleep ends up accidentally activating molecular pathways that normally wait until daylight to become active, as the heat &quot;tricks&quot; the body chemistry into thinking its closer to daytime than it actually is. </p>
<p>So you end up with your body getting a mix of &quot;go to sleep&quot; and &quot;get up, it's morning&quot; signals and that results in pretty rough sleep (if any sleep at all)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty natural to feel sleepy when it's hot. There's a reason that the idea of a midday map is common in many places where it gets very hot during the day. But that's more of a 'it's too hot to do anything, might as well snooze' kind of tired. Generally, for a sound night's sleep, most people prefer a cool room so they can hunker down in some blankets.</p>
<p>But honestly, if you like sleeping in a warm room and you feel well rested in the morning, so that. Sleep expert advice is to help people with a problem sleeping. If you don't have a problem, then you don't need the advice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a Floridian who lives in one of the only tropical regions in the entire country, constant heat and humidity can be very draining. It is incredibly easy to overexert yourself here, making things as simple as walking the dog or mowing the yard into an exercise on its own.</p>
<p>I'll go out on a limb here and say that your body is probably trying to get you to cool down, rather than burn through all that energy so fast. Normally I would love to go out and run and exercise and whatnot, but I can only do about half of that because of how hot it is here, and I find myself taking naps on a daily basis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
