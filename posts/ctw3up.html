		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because our skin has many more sensory nerve endings than our insides. If you think about it, it makes sense. From an evolutionary standpoint, there's no benefit to having highly innervated internal organs, since there was nothing we could do about internal injuries until very recent human history. Your skin is where you want the most sensory nerve endings, because your skin is your first line of defense against external injures which are things you can actually avoid and maybe try to fix.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine nerves/pain sensors as security cameras. They all point to the outside of the building. You are sitting in your bedroom. Watching this footage.</p>
<p>One day, you see some small rat chew your newspapers on your doorstep to shred, you call the exterminators. They get rid of that rat.</p>
<p>A centimeter sized tumor is someone or something already inside your house. You might think there is something wrong with the house. You haven't seen anyone come in. But, your food is getting stolen, the toilet seat is up, and you think this is wierd. You might not think there is any damage since you have no proof of anything to call someone over just yet. You check for the cameras. There is nothing there that is entering your house. No property damage at all.</p>
<p>One day. The tumor having grown enough from eating all your food, that you can see them from the cameras that are pointing outside of your house that someone is moving in your very own house. So, you call the police. A now gigantic invader needs to be pulled out of your house, and you need to renovate to get it out of there. Thank goodness you detected this home invader early. If it ever found your bedroom, it might have killed you in your sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's because the nerve endings that allow us to sense pain don't exist throughout the entire body. There is a high concentration in the skin and some other areas, but entirely non-existent in others. Not the most knowledgeable on this, so double check.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While a woman is ovulating, the follicle grows to about 22mm, which is .86 inches.  Most of the time this isn't felt at all.  After having my c-section, I think I got some sensitive tissue in that area on one side, and ovulating hurts.  It hurts like someone is taking a knife and twisting it in me for hours.  So yeah, sometimes it does hurt, it just depends what's around there to feel it.</p>
<p>One interesting thing I heard, but I cannot find examples of online, is that our intestines wouldn't feel significant pain from being 'cut', but they do feel pain from being 'stretched'.  And that makes sense since one's body would be cut on the outside, not the inside.  And if one's intestines is stretching, then one should definitely be motivated to do something about that, like figure out how to take a good poop asap and avoid whatever got you in this situation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Certainly no expert - but in addition to what's already been said about nerve endings, let's also remember that the human body re-arranges organs to house the creation of another human being. Many times with tumors or things of the like, the body just shifts to accommodate the new mass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
