		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sound is what carves the vinyl. </p>
<p>When recording, in the original technology, the sound vibrates a needle, which is dragged along the spinning disc to carve the grooves. When the record is put on a player, it spins and the needle is dragged across it. The needle is pushed along the ridges of the record, causing it to vibrate in exactly the same way as the one that carved it. That vibration goes up the needle as a sound, gets amplified, and there's your recorded sound. </p>
<p>Sure, in theory, one could map exactly how a particular sound would cause the needle to move, and thus what exact shape of ridges would create that sound when it's played, but it's so complex to do something like that, it'd be easier to literally invent digital sound design and make the sound ypu want happen that way. Simpler to just tryst physics to take care of it for you. It's just a matter of running the same physical process in reverse. </p>
<p>Side fact: it's actually kind of a big deal in physics that most of the laws of physics run exactly the same backwards as they do forwards. There are a few specific things that don't go like that, and that makes them really important in thermodynamics, relativity, quantum mechanics, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The grooves aren't carved by hand to produce that sound. They are directly carved <em>by</em> the sound they will eventually reproduce.</p>
<p>If you sing into a piece of paper you'll notice it starts vibrating. Attach a needle to the piece of paper, place the needle onto a easy to scratch material and you have a way of recording your voice.</p>
<p>Obviously you're gonna need something more sensitive to get anything near high quality audio, but that's the principle behind it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Someone said here a short while ago that sound is &quot;wiggles in air&quot;, and that's a good place to start. All sound is movement of air; in the case of music and speech it is organised wiggles, but still wiggles nonetheless. </p>
<p>In the early days of recorded sound, no electronics were involved; singers and players sang or played in front of an acoustic horn which focused their sound wiggles on a cutting stylus, which vibrated in sympathy with the sound, and was used to cut a groove in a wax cylinder. No analysis was needed to force mimicry, for the vibrations/wiggles of the stylus simply moved in response to the air wiggles. The wiggles in the groove therefore automatically reflected the wiggles in the air.   </p>
<p>To play it back, a similar stylus, without a cutting edge, was used to trace the groove previously cut, and the horn used to project the vibration of the stylus back into wiggles of air.</p>
<p>We moved on to the cutting stylus being used to cut grooves in laquer discs, and these were then used to form metalwork which could press a number of other discs, which had the same groove formation as the original cut of the laquer. </p>
<p>Again, no analysis is required, merely a way to connect the wiggles in the air with the physical process of cutting the groove, such that the cutting stylus moves in accord with the wiggles. </p>
<p>Even with today's electronics, and storage of sound on tape, it still comes down to the same principle; connect the cutting stylus to the wiggles of the sound, and get it to move in sympathy with that. On playback, trace the groove and amplify the result through speakers to convert it back into wiggles of the air.</p>
<p>How do we recognise each voice? Each person has their own unique wiggle. All we need do is capture that wiggle, and play it back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to expand a little…As stated by others, the sound makes the carving. Sound is caused by motioning waves of air. These pressure changes would (originally) move a needle in turn causing the indents into the medium, wax or vinyl.</p>
<p>The original recording devices were a rudimentary microphone and cylinder creator rolled into one. You sang into the end of a giant gramophone which funnelled down into a small thin out-pipe (to amplify the air pressure) next to the needle that would push the grooves into the material. Eventually the process was recreated electronically, but the principle is the same. Grooves move the needle, the needle creates the impulse, the speaker turns the impulse into an identical pattern of air waves.</p>
<p>Additional:
Microphones and your ears work similarly in that the air motion vibrates a piece of film/skin that gets translated into electrical impulses as opposed to punching dents into vinyl.
Playback (as described above) is the opposite.</p>
<p>You can actually see this when you look at the woofer (the larger circle) of your speakers when playing something bassy. Because it is creating longer waves of air, the woofer movement is more noticeable to the naked eye.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
