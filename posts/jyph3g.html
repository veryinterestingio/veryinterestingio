		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Toyota revolutionized a manufacturing process about 40 years ago that allowed bottom up refinements to address manufacturing issues (the assembly guys on the line can spot an issue and report it up the hierarchy to get it changed, rather than waiting for the managers and engineers to discover issue) and had an extreme focus on quality. At this point, other car makers have caught up in many respects and itâ€™s more reputation than anything at this point. And the worst brands today are still better than the best a generation ago in terms of reliability.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was lucky enough to visit Toyota in Japan,  it is insane, its a whole city, Toyota city. I'm not the biggest fan of Toyota but after visiting a couple museums and a factory tour, I came out with an I credible respect and appreciation. The assembly lines were incredibly clean and efficient despite regular groups of distracting tourists. The museum had incredible detail, I could easily have spent half a week learning. It started from the VERY beginning, how they originally make textiles from cotton.  The old equipment and factories. it was a functional museum they did regular demos of various processes, they had a full size stamp that they used to shape a door panel, it was like 3 stories. They showed various innovations and steps for every car part from the headlight to different engines.
I could go on but if thats the kind of work and dedication that goes into just their museum, it doesn't surprise me the quality of cars they make. If you ever get the chance, I would highly recommend visiting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the foundations of Toyota's incremental production improvement processes is called &quot;kaizen&quot;.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSVPX6jhLfw&amp;ab_channel=FoodBankForNewYorkCity" target="_blank">Here's a truly excellent 6-minute YouTube video documenting how Toyota applied it's kaizen improvements to help speed up service at a New York City Food Bank.</a></p>
<p>I thought this was a really neat way for a big company like Toyota to donate that which it is truly the master of (process optimization) and make a long-term, fundamental improvement to this food bank, rather than just hand out a one-time cash donation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
