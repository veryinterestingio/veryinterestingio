Especially for places that do mixed recycling together.  You can't clean paper that gets covered with your yogurt. Even if the container that came in can be easily cleaned.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the recycling center, and what you tossed in.  They generally always have to do manual sorting, as we're terrible about knowing what to recycle, and what not to recycle. Depending on what you add, it may be sent to the landfill itself, contaminate the load and send a bunch of stuff off to the landfill, or potentially even cause problems in the machinery.</p>
<p>A common example are plastic bags, like those you get from the grocery store. These can be recycled in certain circumstances (usually you can drop them off at the store they came from), but often not process where your curbside recycling is picked up. If you throw your recyclables away in such a bag, it could result in the entire load being pitched to the landfill (with the added un-green result of an additional trip for a heavy smog producing vehicle).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what it is that was put into the recycling. It's possible that it can contaminate other recyclables but it's not necessarily the case. </p>
<p>For example, if you put a piece of styrofoam into the recycling it'll just get sorted out at the recycling plant and thrown away. If you throw a can of paint into the recycling and it leaks, it may cause the effected items to no longer be any good. </p>
<p>The same is essentially true of compost. It really depends on what it is you throw in there. If it's something toxic that can't be removed, then it'll contaminate your compost. If it's just a piece of solid waste like a tin can, you can just pick it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked in a prototype plastics recycling plant many, many years ago.  They only recycled soda bottles that were made out of PET plastic.</p>
<p>The bales of crushed bottles were shredded, washed, and made into pellets that were sold to be eventually turned into new products like carpet fibers.</p>
<p>The main problem was separating the contaminants.  This doesn't just mean unwanted trash in the recycling stream, it actually included the labels and caps from the bottles themselves.  At the time, there were still bottles made with aluminum caps so they could be separated out and sold for probably more than the plastic pellets.  But the rest of the stuff was unwanted waste.</p>
<p>The biggest problem however was that a substantial percentage of the caps used a liner that was made out of PVC plastic.  PVC does not melt at the same temperature as PET.  It clogs up the machines that extrude the pellets and discolors the pellets when it burns.</p>
<p>I only worked there for a few months so I don't know how (or if) they solved the PVC contamination problem.  I don't think currently manufactured bottles use PVC cap liners anymore so it's probably not a problem like it was.  Though older bottles could still easily find their way into recycling streams.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
