		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If a consumer computer program crashes, one person gets mildly annoyed and that's about it.  If the program controlling a traffic signal crashes, people can get killed in an car accident.  So a lot more effort and money is spent verifying that the traffic control program is provably correct and well-tested in all sorts of bad conditions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>then why can't it be applied to other software is there something else to it? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It helps that traffic control software runs alone on a single piece of hardware and does a relatively simple job.  There are entire classes of bugs that can be avoided by working out every possible state the program can be in and making sure they are all correctly accounted for.  It's a similar methodology to what software that controls airplanes and the space shuttle go through.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do designers ensure that vital programs like the ones that operate traffic lights or electrical grids don't crash or malfunction? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>An absolutely insane amount of engineering work which costs an insane amount of money.  'Formal verification' is the name of this field in computer science.  Consumer products simply can't afford to be that rigorous and still be sold at a price people would pay.  But if your software is used in situations where it absolutely cannot be allowed to fail there is no other option.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine there were no computers and you had to explain to a human being how to emulate one of these consumer programs. Let's say it's words with friends on an iPhone.</p>
<p>You have to tell them all the what-ifs about what usernames are allowed, a dictionary of words, how to handle low battery or network issues, multiple chat messages coming in at the same time, multiple apple devices, older operating systems, etc. Thousands of combinations of variables that you need to make sure this person (program) can account for.</p>
<p>Now imagine you're telling a traffic controller how to control an intersection. You give some basic rules (can't have multiple intersecting flows of traffic have a green light at the same time), some advanced rules (leave the light on longer if there are more cars waiting), and tell them that if all else fails, just start blinking red and become stop sign. This is a much more manageable task.</p>
<p>The number of inputs for a stop light are very small compared to most apps, and the number of things it needs to do are very limited. It's much easier to write code for this sort of super-focused isolated environment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
