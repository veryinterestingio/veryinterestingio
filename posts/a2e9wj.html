		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>© is Copyright. That means that the work, in part or in whole, represents something that you have the exclusive right to copy. A book, movie, or painting is copyrighted.</p>
<p>™ is Trademark. That means that the image or slogan is not meant to be used by others, as it is used specifically by you in context of your products or services. McDonald's slogan &quot;I'm Lovin' It&quot; is trademarked.</p>
<p>® is Registered Trademark. That means that they took the extra step to record their trademark with the government, solidifying their protections.</p>
<p>In the case of Trademarks of any sort, I can use &quot;I'm Lovin' It&quot; as a line in a novel (provided it isn't referring to a restaurant), as the phrase is not copyrighted. But I can't use it as the tag line for my own restaurant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ™ symbol indicates a claim by the that the word or image is a trademark--something that person has an exclusive legal right to use to distinguish his products in that market. The point of trademarks is so that the purchaser can rely on the reputation the mark has in deciding whether to buy the product.</p>
<p>The ® symbol indicates a <em>registered</em> trademark. The benefit of registration is that it applies in the entire United States, not just where the product is sold, and if others don't oppose the mark's registration within a certain amount of time, that limits their ability to claim the trademark is invalid.</p>
<p>The © symbol indicates a claim of copyright, which gives people a monopoly on distributing a creative work and making new works based on that original. It's not related to trademarks. For example, a text that's in the public domain (not copyrighted) might be sold with the publisher's trademark, and other prints couldn't use that trademark even if they copied the text. Or a copyrighted text might be sold with a name that's not distinguishing enough to be a trademark, allowing someone else to use the name (but not the text itself) for a different product in the same market.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a legal question relating mostly to American intellectual property protection.</p>
<p>™️ - the trademark has not been registered with a national trademark office.</p>
<p>®️ - the trademark has been registered.</p>
<p>©️ - indicates the work has copyright protection. In essence it is a copyright notice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>®️ and ™️ are very similar. They both refer to trademarks. A trademark is usually a name that a company uses in reference to its products. Camry is a trademark of Toyota. The circle R means it is registered with the national trademark office. TM just means that it is a trademark, but not registered.</p>
<p>Circle C is for copyright. Copyrights are different from trademarks. Copyright protects the copy and distribution of a creative work. If you write a song, make a movie or create a piece of software, those things are all protected by copyright. Only the person who owns the copyright is allowed to copy and distribute that work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>© is a symbol indicating copyright. It’s applied to explicitly assert the right, protected by law, to make copies of a creative work in a “fixed medium”, for example a digital recording, a cd, a print, a carving or sculpture. This right is given immediately upon creation of the work and need not register it or use the symbol to maintain your rights. </p>
<p>™️ is a symbol asserting rights to use a trade mark.  That is some phrase or picture or logo used to identify an organization in the course of trade.  An organization owning a trade mark can prevent others from using it — and indeed must do so to maintain its rights. Using the symbol is a way to help enforce your ownership of the mark. </p>
<p>® is a symbol for registered trade mark.  Registering your trade mark with the federal government allows you to sue for additional damages should someone else use your mark.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
