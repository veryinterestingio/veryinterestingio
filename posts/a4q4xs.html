		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's some good answers to this question on Quora, and I really like the answer here: <a href="https://www.quora.com/In-what-order-were-the-planets-in-our-solar-system-formed/answer/Jonathan-Day-10?ch=3&share=dcc12828&srid=vqoHa" target="_blank">https://www.quora.com/In-what-order-were-the-planets-in-our-solar-system-formed/answer/Jonathan-Day-10?ch=3&share=dcc12828&srid=vqoHa</a></p>
<p>What I'd like is to break down the youngest four into order. <strong>How</strong> <strong><em>likely</em></strong> is it that Venus for example might be younger than Mercury? Could Mars be the oldest of these four? Is Earth difficult to age because of the Theia collision? I'm curious for any theories.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The link you posted contains mostly accurate information, but there are problems. For instance, it is probably incorrect to say that Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune formed at similar times. Jupiter and Saturn have very similar compositions to each other, more so than when you compare either of them to the ice giants. It's thought that the jovian planets farther from the Sun took longer to form and captured less hydrogen and helium, explaining why Uranus and Nepturne have larger proportions of hydrogen compounds, rock, and metal.</p>
<p>That author also talked about Pluto like it wasn't just a standard Kuiper belt object. It and other Kuiper Belt remnants would've gotten their orbits settled after most of the system's mass had agglomerated into the major planetesimals.</p>
<p>It is also possible that the inner planets and the cores of the outer planets roughly formed around the same time, though there could've been more than 9 originally and early-system bombardment likely altered orbits significantly since the planetesimals first formed.</p>
<p>My opinion on the ordering is it probably went something like this: Mercury, Theia, Mars, Venus, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. Honestly, though, we just don't know. I list the planets in groupings such that the smallest formed first (takes less time to get less mass) and the jovians formed later (takes a lot of time to accumulate all that hydrogen and helium and whatnot that makes up their atmos).</p>
<p>Source: am Astronomy professor</p>
<p>EDIT: Way more than these formed at first, I know. Just listing the ones we actually know about. And yes, the hypothesis that the jovians formed first is valid. Depends on what you mean by &quot;formed,&quot; though.</p>
<p>EDIT2: Wow, gold from the supernovae that created our stellar nebula? Thanks stranger!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>they all formed at the same time, between 100k and 3 million years after the sun formed. the disc of gas and particles surrounding the sun started to coalesce into many small bodies which crashed into each other, formed planets, formed moons, etc. the inner planets were fully formed after 100k years, but they kept increasing in mass as objects crashed into them and added and subtracted to their mass. the outer planets finished last after 3+ million years, but the inner planets were likely still gaining and losing mass by then too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That Quora answer misses one big thing to me: a discussion of the &quot;frost/snow line&quot;. Inside of the snow line, &quot;volatiles&quot; (water, ammonia, methane, nitrogen, etc. - and notably hydrogen, but it's often considered special) cannot condense.</p>
<p>Technically, there are slightly-different snow lines for each compound, and it varies as the star changes temperature, but all you really need to know is that the line is somewhere in the asteroid belt. The only reason Earth manages to have water is because it was bombarded with icy comets that formed outside the snow line <em>after</em> it got enough gravity to retain things.</p>
<p>Gas giants cannot form inside the snow line, although they may migrate inward.</p>
<hr />
<p>The &quot;beginning&quot; of planet-formation is when the solar system is filled with trillions of kilometer-scale planetesimals, which are rocky bodies (not volatiles). At that scale, gravity between bodies is strong enough to cause enough attraction for planetesimals to collide with each other. (It's not clear how they grow to the 1km size in the first place).</p>
<p>Now, most of the mass in a solar system is hydrogen gas. Kilometer-scale don't have enough gravity to capture it, but as they collide and aggregate, eventually one will get the needed mass. Once that happens, the additional mass of the hydrogen helps it capture even more gas, exponentially, starving all the other wannabe planets.</p>
<p>Thus, we know for sure that Jupiter was the first (surviving) planet to reach that mass. Saturn must have been close behind to still manage almost 1/3 of Jupiter's mass, because exponential growth is nasty. Uranus and Neptune never had a chance to get much hydrogen at all.</p>
<p>The number and orbits of gas giants is essentially random. It is likely that many others started to form, but got hooked by gravity and either:</p>
<ul>
<li>collided with the Sun</li>
<li>collided with another gas giant</li>
<li>achieved escape velocity</li>
</ul>
<p>To survive, a gas giant must stop having those disastrous gravitational interactions, which is only possible by decreasing its eccentricity (i.e. making its orbit nearly circular), or by being the <em>only</em> surviving planet (since the 2-body system is stable regardless of eccentricity).</p>
<hr />
<p>In the inner system, things are different. Since volatiles cannot condense, nobody can take advantage of that exponential growth (remember that Neptune's core is about the same mass as Earth!). Also, orbits are constrained by the need to not go far enough out to be stolen by a gas giant. So the only way for planets to grow is by random collisions. This process continues until all remaining protoplanets occupy orbits that don't interfere with each other - and these orbits will be packed as tightly as possible, because the collisions won't happen unnecessarily. 100 large asteroids collide and become 50, become 25, become 12, become 6.</p>
<p>In our solar system, the six survivors of this process were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mercury</li>
<li>Venus</li>
<li>Earth</li>
<li>Theia</li>
<li>Mars</li>
<li>Ceres (arguably).</li>
</ul>
<p>However, <em>after</em> the inner system was stabilized, Theia <del>got drunk and</del> collided with Earth, thus we ended up with (extra mass and) a moon. Which might be required for life to form on a reasonable timescale, but I digress.</p>
<p>The asteroid belt still exists because those pesky gas giants prevented Ceres from finishing its job. Asteroids, whether in the belt, as trojans to one of the gas giants, or beyond, are simply surviving planetesimals that never got eaten or ejected. Comets are just asteroids in an eccentric orbit that spend most of their time outside the snow line, but form a tail briefly when they go inside it.</p>
<hr />
<p>It's not really meaningful to talk about &quot;the order the planets formed&quot;, because all of this was happening simultaneously. You could argue that Jupiter was &quot;first&quot; and Earth was &quot;last&quot;, but it's a pretty weak definition no matter what.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Jupiter and Saturn were formed first. Their formation started by the accretion of heavy material, which formed their cores. Once the cores reached about 20 Earth masses, they started rapidly accreting the gas in the solar nebula, which was still plentiful. Uranus and Neptune formed next, and since there was less gas avaliable they did not grow as large. It is possible that other ice giants formed, which were ejected from the Solar System (or settled in the outer Solar System - Planet Nine). This took a few million years.</p>
<p>When the giant planets finished forming, the inner Solar System was composed of hundreds of planetesimals, which have about the size of the Moon. In the next tens of million of years, collisions among these planetesimals combined them into larger bodies. Mars growth was halted early by Jupiter's gravity, explaining its smaller size. Mercury is a mistery, it may have finished accreting early as well. The Earth and Venus were the last planets to finish forming, and their formation took about 100 million years. The later part of the formation process, when planetesimals were already quite large, is when the Moon-forming impact happened.</p>
<p>The asteroid belt is material left from the early Solar System, that did not form a planet because of Jupiter's influence. The Kuiper belt, including Pluto, is also the remnants of the Solar System formation. The Kuiper belt likely formed closer to the Sun, and got scattered outwards by the migration of the giant planets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In case that's not clear, what I mean is, imagine the planets formed in order from distance from sun. If Earth finally forms today, when does Mars finish cooking and become a planet? Today? A year from now? 1000 years? 100,000 years?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
