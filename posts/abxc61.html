		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m from Puerto Rico, and Puerto Rico is always Puerto Rico, no matter what language you speak, but for example Japan isn’t called Japan there, it’s “Nippon” in Japanese or “Japón” in Spanish. United States of America gets translated to any language. So it’s not a matter of “Proper names don’t get translated”. So, like, why do some get translated and some don’t?</p>
<p>Edit: Whoa so many interesting things! I almost just googled this, but instead posted here, and I’m glad I did. I’ve learned so much! Thanks everyone!!!</p>
<p>Other edit: Thanks for letting me know Puerto Rico is sometimes translated, though I find it hard to count ‘Porto Rico’ as a translation unless Porto is the word for Port and Rico the word for Rich in your country. It seems more like an adaptation for reasons of pronunciation, or a variation of the same name. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems to depend on how well the original names language was communicated to other languages and how close a relationship they had.</p>
<p>e.g. Puerto Rico was named in Spanish, English and Spanish are easily translated at the time of naming and they had a trading relationship therefore the name was communicated to English as Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Japan likely had little contact with English speakers and little to no trading so they would have learned the name that others used for it. In the case of Japan it seems to come from a translation of a Wu Chinese word through Portuguese.</p>
<p>The closer the trading relationship at the time of naming the more likely the proper name will be used. Historically many places had names in other languages before strong trading relationships existed so the foreign language name stuck e.g. Germany should be called Deutschland but is called Germany in English and Allemagne in French, due to those names become fixed before strong international trade between the nation states could spread the name Deutschland.</p>
<p>Think of it like a person (<strong>A</strong>) you see at work but never really talk to. So you ask another coworker (<strong>B</strong>) what the person's name is. The coworker (<strong>B</strong>) gives you a nickname and upon striking up a conversation you address <strong>A</strong> by that nickname and never go back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the past, if a country's name was frequently talked about in another country speaking another language, it would generally morph into a form easier to pronounce for speakers of that language. Then when people went around and invented dictionaries a couple hundred years ago, they wrote down these forms and boom, that's the name of that country in that language.    </p>
<p>Today, we have instant global communications and a general higher value on cultural accuracy, so people generally stick to something that is as close to &quot;what the locals call it&quot; as they can, except when they adapted form is already long-established (e.g. Japan for Nippon, etc).    </p>
<p>Another wrinkle is when the country's name itself contains <em>words</em> that are not proper names per se, for example <em>The United States of</em> America. In those cases many other languages will still translate however they would say the words &quot;The United States of&quot; even if they leave &quot;America&quot; intact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
