		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't.</p>
<p>This is part of the reason why newly pregnant women suffer from morning sickness; the brand new fetus (or whatever it's called at this early stage) secretes a hormone that suppresses the mother's immune system to stop it attacking the tiny bundle of foreign cells.</p>
<p>Ultimately it's not (usually) a problem, because the mother and fetus have completely separate, independent circulatory systems so the mom's white blood cells can't get to the baby and attack it. This is what the placenta is, it's how the baby's and mom's blood vessels get close enough for oxygen and nutrients to be exchanged, but without actually sharing blood.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't. In addition to the explanations above regarding rH sensitivity, the fetus and later the placenta produce hormones that outright suppress the mother's immune system. This is why so many warnings about illness are specifically targeted at/mention pregnant women as needing to be extra cautious.</p>
<p>It's also why I've had more colds this winter than in the previous decade (thanks, people who bring their sick kids out to eat!) And why each of them has taken more than a week to get over. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Few points to add to this highly informative thread:
The placenta is a fascinating mystery in relation to the immune system. It is formed by tissues of fetal origin/trophoblast (contain fetal DNA and fetal proteins etc), and serves as the interface between maternal and fetal circulations and as such has a wide range of adaptations to help prevent immune attack of the fetus. Stuff like placenta tissue effectively mops up a lot of stray maternal immunoglobulin to prevent it reaching the fetus, and the trophoblast cells which form the placenta are highly resistant to killing by immune cells. Placental cells also appear to express a different type of MHC to avoid being recognised as foreign tissue (MHC=major histocompatability complex, MHC class 1 is expressed on the surface of all nucleated cells, with the placenta being a major exception, and serves as a way for the immune system to recognise self vs non self cells or virally infected cells)
This is particularly important in primates/humans as they have very invasive placentas compared to most species, such that fetal tissues are directly bathed in maternal blood (technical term is haemochorial, whereas other species are epitheliochorial or endochorial, depending on invasuveness and which layer of maternal tissue is contacted by fetal epithelium=chorion), which is likely to be where a lot of the issues to do with compatability between maternal and fetal blood types comes into play
There is also a careful balance struck between maternal uterine macrophages and Natural Killer cells to control the extent to which fetal tissue can invade. uNK cells inhibit trophoblast invasion, but the macrophages prevent uNK cells attacking the fetal tissue.</p>
<p>If anybody spots any inaccuracies in this please do point them out- I'm currently studying this at uni so would appreciate the opportunity to learnt anything I've misunderstood/mistated!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cool fact, it doesn’t attack the baby because of a DNA trait that Mammals borrowed from Viruses!!</p>
<p>“In 2000, a team of Boston scientists discovered a peculiar gene in the human genome. It encoded a protein made only by cells in the placenta. They called it syncytin.</p>
<p>The cells that made syncytin were located only where the placenta made contact with the uterus. They fuse together to create a single cellular layer, called the syncytiotrophoblast, which is essential to a fetus for drawing nutrients from its mother. The scientists discovered that in order to fuse together, the cells must first make syncytin.</p>
<p>What made syncytin peculiar was that it was not a human gene. It bore all the hallmarks of a gene from a virus.</p>
<p>Viruses have insinuated themselves into the genome of our ancestors for hundreds of millions of years. They typically have gotten there by infecting eggs or sperm, inserting their own DNA into ours. There are 100,000 known fragments of viruses in the human genome,  making up over 8% of our DNA. Most of this virus DNA has been hit by so many mutations that it’s nothing but baggage our species carries along from one generation to the next. Yet there are some viral genes that still make proteins in our bodies. Syncytin appeared to be a hugely important one to our own biology. Originally, syncytin allowed viruses to fuse host cells together so they could spread from one cell to another. Now the protein allowed babies to fuse to their mothers.</p>
<p>It turned out that syncytin was not unique to humans. Chimpanzees had the same virus gene at the same spot in their genome. So did gorillas. So did monkeys. What’s more, the gene was strikingly similar from one species to the next. The best way to explain this pattern was that the virus that gave us syncytin infected a common ancestor of primates, and it carried out an important function that has been favored ever since by natural selection. Later, the French virologist Thierry Heidmann  and his colleagues discovered a second version of syncytin in humans and other primates, and dubbed them syncytin 1 and syncytin 2. Both virus proteins seemed to be important to our well-being. In pre-eclampsia, which gives pregnant women dangerously high blood pressure, levels of both syncytin 1 and syncytin 2 drop dramatically. Syncytin 2 also performs another viral trick to help its human master: it helps tamp down the mother’s immune system so she doesn’t attack her baby as a hunk of foreign tissue.”</p>
