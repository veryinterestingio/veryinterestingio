		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Shock. When my brother died I understood he was dead but everything was happening so fast and my brain couldn't process the magnitude of the situation. People wouldn't just leave me alone for 5 minutes. I remember everyone around me being extremely hysterical and it just being more than I could process at the time.  I'm not a very huggy, affectionate person so it wasn't the place for me to deal with my emotions. I had to walk out of the police station and hide behind the building. For the first several days we had so many people in and out of the house and the phones rang non stop. I just have no alone time It kept my mind very distracted. Meanwhile I start to realize days gone by and its the longest I've gone without seeing my brother. I felt like it was a dream and he would just come back home. Thats really when you start to realize time and what &quot;forever&quot; truly means. Then it hits you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
