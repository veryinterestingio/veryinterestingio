		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kind of. Check out the expreriments by Mikhail Lukin -- he was the first one to &quot;stop&quot; light. Not really stop, but get it to several meters per second. However, he did it by employing certain clever tricks, not just by using some material with high refractive index as such -- see a nice explanation by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RobusEtCeleritas" target="_blank">/u/RobusEtCeleritas</a> above.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you define the “speed” of light to be its <strong>group</strong> speed (as opposed to its phase speed or signal speed), then yes.</p>
<p>Although in practice, indices of refraction only vary so much. A much better way to decrease the group velocity of light is to exploit rapid <em>changes</em> in the index of refraction.</p>
<p>The group velocity (dω/dk) can be written as</p>
<p>v<em><em>g</em></em> = c/(n + ω dn/dω).</p>
<p>So to make the group speed very small (“slow light”) or approximately zero (“stopped light”), you can either make n very large, or you can make dn/dω very large. Like I said above, it’s hard to find a medium with a high enough n to reach very slow velocities (the slowest reaches experimentally are less than 10 m/s). However you can find situations where dn/dω is huge, for example near some kind of resonant behavior in a cold atomic gas. There are now ways to produce slow light in room temperature solid-state media, photonic waveguides, etc. as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Kind of. You can't slow it down completely (this would require, for example, an infinite refractive index) but you can reduce the group speed pretty well.</p>
<p><a href="https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.87.031801" target="_blank">This</a> is a paper where light resonant to an ultracold gas stays, on average, 16 seconds in the system. Although I should note that this works only for certain frequencies where dn/dω diverges, and a system where a wide variety of wavelengths is slowed down to these speeds would require unrealistically large refractive indices over a large wavelength range.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>when light moves through a medium, is it only &quot;slowed down&quot; because it has to take a longer path through the medium? E.g., it has to do many more bounces, so the &quot;speed&quot; that it appears to be traveling in appears to be longer because it is bouncing and zig-zagging through a medium so the path of it is much longer? Or is it some sort of other wave-manipulating effect at play? Thank you</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
