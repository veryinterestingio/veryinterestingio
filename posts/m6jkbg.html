		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some similar bacteria likely travelled up there on the astronauts or some item. </p>
<p>What makes every organism unique is it’s DNA. bacteria change their DNA a lot, it’s why they adapt so fast. If they make a change that makes them unable to survive, those DNA changes will not be passed on. What determines if the DNA changes are good or bad is the environment. </p>
<p>For instance, if some change makes you better at surviving in the cold, but you live in a hot climate, it likely won’t get passed on. In a cold climate, it could be very useful. </p>
<p>The ISS is a very unique environment. Everything is precisely controlled and does not exchange anything with the outside. This would lead to unique DNA changes being passed on. </p>
<p>A similar situation is observed on islands. Before people started moving around so much, taking animals and diseases with them, islands bred unique organisms because they were isolated from each other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bacteria come from other bacteria. As for where “new” bacteria come from, there are two answers to that:</p>
<p>One, we don’t have a catalog of every type of bacteria that exists. The number of different bacteria that we don’t have a record of probably outnumbers the ones that we do know about explicitly. So sometimes a new type of bacteria is discovered not because it came from anywhere, but because no one noticed it before.</p>
<p>Two, every time a bacterium reproduces, just like anything else, there is a chance the reproduction process will include errors. These errors are mutations, which can change the nature of the bacteria that result. Accumulate enough mutations, and you wind up with, effectively, a new bacteria.</p>
<p>Bacteria reproduce extremely quickly in comparison to most macroscopic life, so changes that would take millennia or longer to happen in most species can take place in a matter of a few years with bacteria.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to the other responses, also note that such simple organisms can evolve very fast due to short generations.</p>
<p>I.e. while a generation for humans is in the ballpark of about 20 years, for bacteria it's a matter of hours.</p>
<p>And while asexual reproduction does hinder the evolution, if you start with one bacteria and end up with a couple trillion in a matter of months, there ought to be completely new species evolved to survive in the new environment.</p>
<p>The same would happen to any other species, it would just take a lot longer, especially if it's not artificially tweaked (like when humans bred new dogs for example).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To illustrate just how fast bacteria can evolve and adapt, <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/watch-ecoli-evolve-your-eyes-180960418/" target="_blank">Here's</a> a video of e.coli developing antibiotic resistance.</p>
<p>It's not <em>quite</em> the same as a new species evolving, but helps give an idea of how fast it can happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
