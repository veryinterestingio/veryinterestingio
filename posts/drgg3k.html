<p>Any material,  plastic bag Vs a plastic bottle. A tight drum skin Vs a loose drum skin, will vibrate depending on its siffness. The stiffer the item the more it vibrates.</p>
<p>The shape of the item and how it relates to air makes the sound you hear. So a bell made of lead will ring louder than a ball of copper half buried in sand. Even though a copper bell is louder than a lead one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Metals and other materials ring is call resonance. The pitch at which the resonance occurs is caused by the amount of deflection of the object (stiffness) along with the mass (weight). For the case of a guitar string, you will notice the larger strings play a lower note, this is because the weight of the string and how tight it is pulled. The reason a heavier string is used is because you can apply more tension to the string and get the same resonance. If you used a small string and tried to tune it to low E, the string would be so loose it would strike the fretboard and cause buzzing. Because a heavier string will deflect less at the same tension, you can achieve the resonance frequency you desire with deflection within tolerance; however a heavier string will give you different harmonics.</p>
<p>Harmonics are additional frequencies that are heard in addition to the main resonance frequency but that have less power than the resonance frequency. These frequencies combine to give you a full picture of a sound. This is how you can tell the difference between a piano or a guitar even though they may be playing the same note and also help you judge distance and direction of a sound.</p>
<p>Some metals do not make a sound because they are not stiff enough or have too much deflection to be audable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It also is affected by the size and shape of the object. A long skinny metal rod will ring way better than a screw, because at the end of the day that ringing sound is just the metal vibrating fast enough to cause pressure waves in the air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tons of wrong answers or partially correct answers in here. I'll chime in, as I am a specialist in vibration of metallic structures.</p>
<p>Natural frequency depends not only on material properties, but physical arrangement and constraint as well. Consider a bar made of 6061-T6511 aluminum. If you clamp it at one end and strike the middle with a mallet, you'll get a totally different response than if you clamp it at both ends and strike the middle with a mallet. The natural frequencies will depend on the choice of material, the dimensions of the bar, and the method of constraint. The response will depend on both the natural frequencies and how the bar is excited (where, how it is struck).</p>
<p>Real structures have multiple (infinite in fact) natural frequencies. If you want to design something to be useful in producing musical tones, you want to come up with something that has a fundamental (lowest) natural frequency that corresponds to some particular note, such as 440 Hz for concert A4, and upper natural frequencies that are well spaced or if possible integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. When you excite it, the response is going to contain a combination of the natural frequencies, so you want to design it such that the fundamental is a strong contributor, and other frequencies that aren't multiples of the fundamental are weak contributors. Simple structures are good for this, and you can choose the clamping points carefully to try and get more harmonics to be multiples of the fundamental. Taught strings and xylophone keys work well. Structures like circular membranes don't work well for producing tones, since you'll get a jumble of diasonant frequencies in the response and this is why drum heads don't tend to produce as distinct tones as other instruments.</p>
<p>Beefy structures or structures made of stiff materials will, in general, will have really high and diasonant frequencies, so you'll hear a clang or thud when you whack it. Sometimes you get lucky and find a structure that makes a nice sound when you excite it, but it's not entirely material dependent.</p>
<p>Material damping will play a role in how sustained the tone is, if you get one. For this reason, some materials will sound inherently better even if you nail the configuration for producing a tone. This is why you see different woods, for example, being prefer in crafting quality instruments.</p>
<p>Designing structures to have certain frequencies requires knowledge of structural dynamics. This is one of my areas of expertise, as I design aircraft components for a living. We design for frequencies not to produce certain tones, but rather to not coincide with frequencies from rotor blades or rotating engine components.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
