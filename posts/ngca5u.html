		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short of it is: we don't know. </p>
<p>This is something that some of Bill Gates' research has delved into because of malaria being such a huge problem in 3rd world countries (and even some more developed countries). We have the technology, currently, to wipe mosquitoes off of the planet. It's already been developed! We have a way to sterilize the breeding process and in just a few short years mosquitos would be gone.</p>
<p>The <em>only</em> thing stop anyone is that we just don't know what the impact would be. It turns out that mosquitos offer much, much less to the environment than we thought. One simple example that we were all taught is that bats live off of mosquitos. It was believed that mosquitos were a large part of bat diets and this was a big hiccup but recent research has suggested that just isn't true at all*. Something like less than 10 or 5% of the insects bats eat are mosquitos (citation needed, I know it's very small).</p>
<p>Basically, we are in a spot where we don't want to do something that can't be undone and we don't want another situation where we think we understand the consequences but we really don't (see: removal of wolves from yellowstone).</p>
<p>But I agree, let's just wipe them out.</p>
<p>Edit: added clarification that the bat thing is just an example. Obviously, this problem is much more nuanced than just bat food.</p>
<p>Also, *specifically, we believe that not only are mosquitos a small portion of their food source, they are easily replaceable in their diets and their complete absence shouldn't harm bats at all!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We're notoriously bad at answering that question; mosquitos occupy their ecological niche, ecologies are extremely complex things, and complex things are extremely prone to the law of unintended consequences.</p>
<p>If we were able to wipe them out tomorrow, it's a stone-cold certainty that there would be noticable knock-on effects that weren't anticipated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everything that exists exists because of natural selection. There is no &quot;purpose&quot; to any living thing. Nobody say down with a master plan for the ecosystem and designed the animals needed to make it work. Any behavior or trait is such because it has evolved to be that way over billions of years.  Mosquitos are food for fish, bats, frogs, birds, and in some species they pollinate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
