		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's break this question into its constituent parts:</p>
<p>1) Can volcanic eruptions produce global cooling like nuclear winters?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_winter" target="_blank">Volcanic winters</a> are essentially the volcanic equivalent of nuclear winters. These are caused by ash and/or sulfur compounds being injected into the atmosphere which in turn increase the albedo of the Earth and a decrease in temperatures. Extremely large and explosive eruptions (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervolcano" target="_blank">supervolcanoes</a>) and even smaller explosive eruptions can cause global cooling, but the extent and effect scales with their size (e.g. the cooling associated 1991 eruption of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Pinatubo" target="_blank">Pinatubo</a>). The most significant volcanic winters are likely related to eruptions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_igneous_province" target="_blank">large igneous provinces (LIP)</a>, not because they are especially explosive, but rather because they erupt HUGE amounts of material over extended periods of time, i.e. thousands to millions of years of nearly continuous, massive eruptions of flood basalts. There is really no modern analogue to the eruption of a LIP.</p>
<p>2) Are volcanic winters or other volcanic processes linked to any extinction events?</p>
<p>There are no major extinction events linked to a specific supervolcanic eruption and ensuing volcanic winter. For a while, it was argued that the environmental disturbance related to an eruption of Toba in Indonesia caused a major die off of (but not wholesale extinction) of a variety of large mammals, humans included in the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toba_catastrophe_theory" target="_blank">Toba catastrophe</a>. As the wiki article shows though, this idea has largely fallen out of favor. However, the eruptions of LIPs have been linked to several mass extinctions, most notably the end-Permian mass extinction (the largest mass extinction in Earth history), e.g. these papers: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00083-9" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/7/e1500470" target="_blank">2</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031018217302857?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">3</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031018210003238?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">4</a>. In some cases, the causative mechanism is thought to be a volcanic winter, but in other cases (like the Permian), it was actually massive amounts of CO2 that caused extreme warming and ocean acidification (amongst other things). In the Permian case, it was the eruption of the Siberian Traps through carbonate rocks which caused the influx of CO2 into the atmosphere. </p>
<p>3) Are there volcanically related extinctions tied to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercontinent_cycle" target="_blank">supercontinent cycle</a>?</p>
<p>Potentially. LIPs are often associated with the eruption of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_plume" target="_blank">plumes</a> and the initiation of the continental rifting process (whether this is occurring during the rifting of a supercontinent or more general rifting, e.g. the formation of the East African Rift was preceded by the eruption of a LIP in the vicinity of the modern day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afar_Triple_Junction" target="_blank">Afar Triple Junction</a>) often starts with a LIP eruption and a plume. Given the previous discussion of the potential role of LIP eruptions in extinctions, it has been speculated that supercontinent break up (and the associated LIPs) could case mass extinctions, e.g. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259366715_The_supercontinent_cycle_A_retrospective_essay" target="_blank">this paper</a>. <del>But, as far as I know, none of the recorded extinctions associated with LIPs are related to LIPs thought to be related to supercontinent breakup.</del> EDIT: As pointed out by /u/loki130, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Atlantic_magmatic_province" target="_blank">Central Atlantic magmatic province (CAMP)</a> LIP is associated with the break up of Pangea and is coincident with end-Triassic extinction. Interestingly, it seems that the extinction is better correlated with initial intrusion of the CAMP (and with the associated outgassing being the driver of environmental change that drove the extinction event), not the actual beginning of surface eruptions, e.g. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15596" target="_blank">this paper</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>You're thinking about these breakups as if they were instantaneous events.  A supercontinent breakup  takes millions of years.  Nuclear winters and extinction events are  brief cataclysmic events only lasting a few years, or a century, tops. Weather  time scales and evolutionary time scales are completely incompatible with geologic time scales.</p>
<p>It's like reading the complete works of Shakespeare by the light of a camera flash or a birthday candle.</p>
<p>Now, can a supercontinent breakup affect climate?  Absolutely.  Can it cause species to evolve?  Again, absolutely.  But not mass extinctions, not &quot;nuclear&quot; winters.  The time scales are wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of long winded answers but the truth is we are still experiencing 'the break up' of the supercontinent. It didn't happen overnight, in a week or hundreds of thousands of years, it's still going after 7 billion years. It has expanded and contracted twice since the forming of the Earth. Is there nuclear winter now?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rift scenarios don't force water and gas underground creating buoyant cataclismic volcanism.
The resulting volcanism is like the mid atlantic ridge, slow hawaiian style lava. Africas rift valley is also non violent.
Deccan traps is one of the biggest volcanic regions known, but it didnt kill the dinosaurs that much, a global earthquake of magnitude ten did that. There isnt much evidence of rift provoked nuclear winters afaik. Hotspots and supernovas maybe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
