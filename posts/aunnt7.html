I was trying to understand why dividing 1 by 49 or 499... 499999 results in all the powers of 2 only varying by the 0 in between. Does 49 has any special quality in order to get those results? Thanks.</p>

<p>Dividing 1/49 is 0.02 and change simply because it is slightly larger than 1/50 (truly 0.02).</p>
<p>Now, if you look at adding zeros to the denominator of the fraction 1/50, you'll get 1/500 (0.002), 1/5000 (0.0002), etc. </p>
<p>Doing the exercise for 1/49, adding a 9 each time, is essentially doing the same exercise, but in each case, the values are merging closer and closer together in terms of absolute value. 1/49999 and 1/50000 are very much closer together compared to 1/49 to 1/50. Once you divide by enough powers of 10, 1/499....999 is, for all intents and purposes, the same as 1/500...000. For the same reasons why .999999...999 is mathematically equal to 1. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0.999" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0.999</a>...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>dividing 1 by 998001 gives you
.000001002003004005006.... 996997999000001
(All three digit number skips 998)</p>
<p>1 divided by 9801 gives
.0001020304... etc. skips 98 then repeats</p>
<p>1 divided by 81 gives
.0123456790.... etc. skips 8 then repeats</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ll try to do this with 4th-6th grade math instead of calculus. </p>
<p>First let’s use whole numbers and work our way up to fractions. Let’s do 1000/8. </p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>We start with 1/8 in the thousands place. Nope, doesn’t work. Let’s try 10/8 in the hundreds place. That gives us a 1 in the hundreds, remainder 2 in the 100s place. We can write this remainder as a fraction, (2 x 10^2)/8. </p>
<p>Dividing by 8 is the same as multiplying by 1/8, so we can write this remainder as 2 x 1/8 x 10^2.  This means that 1000/8 = 100 + 2 x 1/8 x 10^2.  </p>
<p>We can pull a sneaky cheat here and say that 10^2 = 10 x 10. So we can write it as 2 x 1/8 x 10 x 10, and using associative property we can make it (2 x 10) x (1/8 x 10), or 20 x 10/8. We already know from before that 10/8 is 1 remainder 2, or 1 + 2/8. This means we can write 20 x 1/8 as 20 x (1 + 2/8). Using the distributive property, we get 20 + 40/8. This means that we can write 1000/8 as 100 + 20 + 40/8. </p>
<p>40/8 is, of course, 5, so we can write 1000/8 = 100 + 20 + 5 or 125. </p>
<p>Make sure you understand the above before reading on, and ask if you need clarification!</p>
<p>Now let’s take an easy fraction, say, 1/8. I’ll go a bit quicker this time since it’s actually the exact same problem as 1000/8, just with the decimal in a different spot. </p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>1 doesn’t go into 8, so we add a decimal and go to 10ths. 10 divided by 8 is 1, remainder 2. Since 2 is in the 10ths column, it is actually 2 x 10^-1, and the next step would be to divide this result by 8. Thus, we can write 1/8 as 0.1 + (2 x 10^-1)/8. </p>
<p>(2 x 10^-1)/8 is the same as 2 x 1/8 x 10^-1. We can sneaky cheat again and write that as 2 x 10^-1 x (0.1 + 2 x 10^-1). Using distributive property we get 0.2 x 10^-1 + 4/8 x 10^-2. So 1/8 is the same as 0.1 + 0.02 + 4/8 x 10^-2. </p>
<p>4/8 is 1/2 or 0.5, so we can simplify 4/8 x 10^-2 to 0.5 x 10^-2, or 0.005. Thus, 1/8 = 0.1 + 0.02 + 0.005, or 0.125. </p>
<p>Again, make sure you understand this before moving on.</p>
<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>
<p>You may have noticed our sneaky cheat of turning all remainders into a number multiplied by 1/8 means we will always get a remainder of 2 when we divide 1 by 8, because 8 is 2 away from 10. This means we could also do the problem like this:</p>
<p>1/8 = 10/8 x 10^-1 = 1 x 10^-1 + 2 x 10^-1 x 1/8</p>
<p>So</p>
<p>1/8 = 1 x 10^-1 + 2 x 10^-1 (1 x 10^-1 + 2 x 10^-1 x 1/8) = 1 x 10^-1 + 2 x 10^-2 + 4 x 10^-2 x 1/8</p>
<p>So continuing the pattern, we get:</p>
<p>1/8 = 1 x 10^-1 + 2 x 10^-2 + 4 x 10^-3 + 8 x 10^-3 x 1/8. </p>
<p>A remainder 8 is problematic, because 8 is greater than or equal to 8 and we need our remainder to be smaller. Time to simplify:</p>
<p>1/8 = 0.1 + 0.02 + 0.04 + 0.01 = 0.125. </p>
<p>This version isn’t absolutely critical to understanding the problem, but it helps. </p>
<p><strong>Actual Problem</strong></p>
<p>So we do 1/49:</p>
<p>1 doesn’t go into 49, so we add a decimal and go to 10ths. 10 doesn’t go into 49, so we add another decimal and go to 100ths. 100/49 is 2, so we have 0.02 (or 2 x 10^-2) with a remainder of 2 x 10^-2. As per earlier, we can write 1/49 as 2 x 10^-2 + 2 x 10^-2 x 1/49. </p>
<p>Is getting late, so I’m going to throw caution to the wind and hope this isn’t too big a jump:</p>
<p>We can take the 1/49 in the remainder another iteration, and we can use exponent notation instead of just writing 2 x 10^-2 over and over:</p>
<p>1/49 = 2 x 10^-2 + (2 x 10^-2)^2 + (2 x 10^-2)^2 + 1/49</p>
<p>And another iteration:</p>
<p>1/49 = 2 x 10^-2 + (2 x 10^-2)^2 + (2 x 10^-2)^3 + (2 x 10^-2)^3 + 1/49</p>
<p>And so on. </p>
<p>When we convert this back to decimals, we’ll get:</p>
<p>1/49 = 0.02 + 0.0004 + 0.000008 + 0.00000016 + 0.0000000032 + 0.000000000064 + 0.00000000000128 + ...</p>
<p>And that’s... IDK, ELI14 maybe?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
