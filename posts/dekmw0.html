		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One way that some librarians or bookstores organise books &quot;alphabetically&quot; is by using the Chinese <em>pinyin</em> system.</p>
<p>Basically, pinyin is how you would &quot;spell&quot; a Chinese word using the alphabet based on the word's pronunciation.</p>
<p>For example, the characters for Beijing are 北京, and the pinyin is indeed &quot;bei jing&quot;.</p>
<p>Using this modern method of organisation, 北京 (Beijing) would be in the &quot;B&quot; section based on its pinyin, as the pinyin is also organised A to Z.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> A little further detail. Each Chinese character represents one &quot;word&quot; of pinyin, e.g. the above example 北京 is 北 (bei) and 京 (jing) together. Most pinyin &quot;words&quot; are made of two, three or four letters which represent the way you would pronounce them in spoken Mandarin.</p>
<p>When I'm booking a train ticket here in China, the city names are listed from A to Z according to the pinyin of the characters. So if I wanted to go to Shanghai (上海，shang + hai), it would be under &quot;S&quot;. My own city Xiamen (厦门，xia + men) would be under &quot;X&quot;.</p>
<p>This is not the only way of organising Chinese characters - one other way may be ordering the characters by the amount of brush strokes it takes to write them, e.g. the character 上 (shang; up) requires three strokes and would be somewhere near the top of the list.</p>
<p>Likewise you can organise the characters by the &quot;components&quot; within them, called radicals. For example, the character 板 (ban; wood or plank) contains a radical called 木 (mu; wood or tree) on the left side. All characters containing that radical on the left side of the character may be categorised together.</p>
<p>There are other methods too. The above two that I just mentioned are a little older and more complicated, but still fairly commonly used. The pinyin method is new but is gaining ground as the most popular method of organisation on computers, mobile apps and book stores because of its simplicity and the young generation's stronger familiarity with the pinyin system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pingyin is a product of westernization.</p>
<p>First you need to understand a chinese word. it could be ranging from a single block like water 水 where as something like an ambassy would be using 3 word 大使馆</p>
<p>to actually find the word in a dictionary, you need to understand that a character is made up of components.</p>
<p>操 is made up of 3 parts, the 手leftside radical, then the 品top radial, and lastly the 木radical.</p>
<p>You would then organise all the letters with the leftside radical together, then further organise them on the 2nd top radical, and lastly on the bottom radical.</p>
<p>Here is where it gets fuky. there is basic words in the chinese vocab that are considered the &quot;fundamentals&quot;, those are categorized by number of strokes, and are basically our ABCs, except they actually mean something.</p>
<p>So in a typical dictionary, it would be the basic, then ALWAYS followed by left hand radicals, which then sub divide into the right hand component. Then once all left hand radicals are logged, you move onto ones with no left hand radical but only top radicals, so on and so forth. And unlike english, while you could gain some meaning from reconizing radicals, it is nearly impossible to know the pronounciation and actual meaning of the word, compared to english, where you can read it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I studied Japanese in Japan for a few months, so I don't really understand the details. But the way things like dictionaries were organized was by stroke order and radicals of the Kanji. Like I said, I don't really understand it but the idea is that you order entries based on the way the symbols are written. In book stores, for example, authors are just ordered by their romanized names because that's obviously a lot easier.</p>
<p>I also studied Akkadian for a few semesters, which is written in cuneirofrm. Most Akkadian dictionaries are simply transcribed and ordered alphabetically, with some extra entries for letters like š (after s). The reference works that are actually in cuneiform use a somewhat chaotic and arbitrary method that lists all symbols that start with one horizontal wedge, then those with two horizontal wedges, etc, then the same for slanted wedges, then angle wedges, then vertical wedges. I never used any cuneiform dictionary myself, so I'm not sure how convenient it is. Cuneiform is a fairly complicated writing system in general though. Also, keep in mind that this is how <strong>modern</strong> reference works are ordered and even that's not universal. There are ancient lists a dictionaries written in cuneiform but I actually don't know how those are ordered. Although I'm guessing there was a similar system because assigning a fixed, random order to all of the hundreds of symbols would just be impractical.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
