		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't answer ALL the factors you asked about but:</p>
<ul>
<li>you want your nose close to the mouth to smell your food (for safety reasons)</li>
<li>you want your eyes as far forward and as high up as possible for seeing things</li>
<li>You want your mouth far from the waste-hole</li>
<li>You want all three of those sensory organs as close to the brain as possible (faster processing AND shorter wires are less likely to get injured. This latter one is actually a big deal. If your eyes were away from your brain, breaking your neck would blind you! If your mouth was away from your head, breaking your back means you physically cant eat because you can't swallow).</li>
</ul>
<p>You're right, the typical configuration isn't the ONLY solution to the above (and other) requirements riddle, but it's a pretty darn good solution - and evolution is <em>very</em> much a fan of &quot;if it's good enough, that's good enough&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Across the animal kingdom, the distribution of sensory organs is a function of the environment and adaptation niche. Accordingly, many of the factors mentioned in early responses give good reasons for the common configuration in vertebrates.  </p>
<p>Other groups show great 'creativity' (sorry üòâ).  Many arthropods (insects, lobsters etc.) smell or taste or hear with their limbs and extremities, for instance, often farther from the brain than even the anus. The more you look, the definition of an 'eye' or 'nose' starts to seem rather fluid and stunningly nebulous. They are often not even localized so you can point when teaching your toddler!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer I'd mention is:</p>
<ol>
<li>we're all digestive tubes with annex systems (evolutionary, that's an important aspect)</li>
<li>if the &quot;input&quot; opening is at one end, it's advantageous to have other inputs around that end so you can be more selective with what you try to eat</li>
<li>light inputs usually come from above (Sun), so that's where the eyes tend to be arranged. Here's Dawkins explaining it in a nice video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X1iwLqM2t0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X1iwLqM2t0</a></li>
<li>other inputs are gathered as you move in a direction and encounter them frontally, so it's again advantageous to have more &quot;input sensing organs&quot; in that region</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, if you had a mouth at the bottom end, you'd need to live more like a plant and you'd also have to deal with sensing your own waste as it would be near the waste hole.</p>
<p>Lots of invertebrates actually have many visual sensors even on the back of their heads. It's one of the reasons why it's difficult to sneak up on a fly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A reason could be, that you want to have short pathways to the brain, so you can process information faster.</p>
<p>In higher developed organism, it¬¥s important to know what to eat, so my guess is, that this the reason they are also so close together, and food tends to be on the ground, so the mouth is below the nose and eyes, which otherwise would also get in the way.  </p>
<p>Eye position probably developed, because there is a optimal field of view (or other important factor you can prioritize, like the overlapping field of view).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
