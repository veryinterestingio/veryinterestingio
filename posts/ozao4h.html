<p>Could you empty the brake lines in your car and fill it with water and have them still work?</p>
<p>The only thing I can think of is that water freezes easily and that could mess with a system as soon as the temperature drops, but if you were in a place that were always temperate, would they be interchangeable?</p>
<p>Obviously this is not done for probably a lot of good reasons, but I'm curious.</p></div></div>

<li>Water is not a lubricant.  </li>
<li>Water Rusts metal.</li>
<li>Water has a high freezing temperature and a low boiling point</li>
<li>Water has a ton of impurities.  Some systems that use water must use RO/Deionized water.  This would be very dangerous in the field.</li>
<li>Water will be quickly contaminated by the environment as it is a solvent.</li>
<li>Water cannot sustain much vacuume before boiling.  </li>
</ol>
<p>This is why water is almost never used as a hydraulic fluid in machinery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You answered your own question.  For brake fluid, specifically, you can't have it boil or freeze, EVER.  Also, water is a universal solvent and that's a property you don't want in a critical system.  All of these reasons are why we don't use water as a hydraulic fluid often.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The freezing part is one part but the other is heat.
Brakes get really, really hot sometimes. Even dedicated brake fluid which is designed for those applications, can get so hot it boils in extreme situations. When the brake fluid boils, that causes bubbles in the system, which CAN be compressed. But that's bad. You want all of your mechanical brake pedal force to transfer to the brake pads, not to compressing voids in the fluid.
Most brake fluid boils between 400-500 degrees F. Obviously, water wouldn't stand a chance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water for brake fluid:</p>
<p>When it gets below freezing: the water becomes ice and your brakes irrepairably break</p>
<p>When you go to brake hard: The water in the brake caliper piston boils, and your brake pedal goes straight to the floor while the brakes stop braking.</p>
<p>Over time: The water rusts out the pot metal the brake piston or wheel cylinder is made of, causing leaks or jams, probably both. One sends your pedal to the floor, the other refuses to let the brake brake</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
