		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From <a href="https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects-and-stories/medicine/polio-20th-century-epidemic" target="_blank">this</a> article:<br />
&quot;For centuries, protection from polio was passed down through the generations. Mothers who had survived polio infection themselves passed on immunity to their babies in the womb and through breast milk.</p>
<p>There are two stages to the polio infection. In the first mild stage the infection stays in the digestive system and throat and doesnâ€™t reach the central nervous system. Most babies with maternal immunity are able to fight off the disease at this stage with only mild flu-like symptoms. At the same time, exposure to the first stage gives them their own long-term immunity.</p>
<p>But the unforeseen consequence of better hygiene and sanitation at the end of the 1800s was that babies in clean surroundings  stopped encountering the infection while they still had maternal immunity.</p>
<p>So they failed to develop their own long-term immunity and were not protected when they encountered the disease later in life. And exposure to polio in late childhood or as an adult, was more likely to develop to the second, more aggressive stage of the disease.&quot;</p>
<p>TL;DR - Better hygiene and sanitation prevented early exposure and caused the second more aggressive stage of the disease to become more prevalent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
