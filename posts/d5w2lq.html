AMA about scientific accuracy, research misconduct, retraction, etc. (<a href="http://jamesheathers.com/" target="_blank">http://jamesheathers.com/</a>)</p>
<p>I am Maria Kowalczuk, part of the Springer Nature Research Integrity Group. We take a positive and proactive approach to preventing publication misconduct and encouraging sound and reliable research and publication practices. We assist our editors in resolving any integrity issues or publication ethics problems that may arise in our journals or books, and ensuring that we adhere to editorial best
practice and best standards in peer review. I am also one of the Editors-in-Chief of Research Integrity and Peer Review journal. AMA about how publishers and journals ensure the integrity of the published record and investigate different types of allegations. (<a href="https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/" target="_blank">https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/</a>)</p>
<p>Both James and Maria will be online from 9-11 am ET (13-15 UT), after that, James will check in periodically throughout the day and Maria will check in again Thursday morning from the UK. Ask them anything!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>**Alright, seadogs one and all, I'm spent. I've been checking in on this for about 8 hours now. But I'll still answer questions in perpetuity if you like, though: user tag me and I'll get to it.</p>
<p>One thing I'd draw your attention to in particular if you're interested in peer review - I'm working as part of a team who's adding a new aspect to peer review - trying to figure out quality assessment of a study in advance. Basically, post-publication review but for accuracy/reproducibility. Can you tell if a study is worthwhile just by reading it?</p>
<p>This is a big old project, so we can use the help. If you want to know more, I've set up a subreddit for it: www.reddit.com/r/repliCATS - more info there.</p>
<p>Thanks for today, it's been a lot of work but damn it if I haven't had fun.**</p>
<p>Previous continues below:</p>
<p>Oi oi. The above looks a bit thin, so I've expanded.</p>
<p>I’m James Heathers - scientist, occasional author, and data thug. I'm a research scientist at Northeastern University in Boston.</p>
<p>(Data what? <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/02/meet-data-thugs-out-expose-shoddy-and-questionable-research" target="_blank">Data thug.</a> Silly name, but it kind of stuck.)</p>
<p>For the last five years, I’ve been involved in the meta-scientific research area of error detection. What is that? It’s using mathematical, analytical, and practical techniques to investigate if published research is accurate. Basically, it's post-publication peer review. With numbers.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we find serious problems. I’ve been involved in a [few] (<a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/09/cornell-nutrition-scientist-resigns-after-retractions-and-research-misconduct-finding" target="_blank">https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/09/cornell-nutrition-scientist-resigns-after-retractions-and-research-misconduct-finding</a>)
[investigations] (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/11/researchers-find-oddities-in-high-profile-gender-studies/" target="_blank">https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/11/researchers-find-oddities-in-high-profile-gender-studies/</a>) into these sorts of accuracy issues.</p>
<p>Doing this has made me something of a … let’s say “peer review and retraction connoisseur”. Most days, I get emails from people who’ve uncovered problems in peer review (both the normal kind and the post-publication kind) and need advice. There's not a lot of people to talk to about this sort of thing, and it's not a topic that many people are comfortable with.</p>
<p>Scientists as a whole don't talk about errors, misconduct, and fraud much. They should.</p>
<p>Where I am on the tubes:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jamesheathers" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/jamesheathers</a> &lt;- start here, probably</p>

<p>NOTE: if you have questions about the accuracy of a paper that you yourself have found, my advice is make yourself a burner account at www.protonmail.com and email me.</p>
<p>Now: I was going to AMA at 9am, but there's already a dozen questions, so I'll start answering them.</p>
<p>Will be here throughout the day, most likely heavily caffeinated and muttering darkly.</p>
<p>EDIT: Still here. Keep 'em coming.</p>
<p>EDIT AGAIN: God I'm terrible at self-promotion. Totally forgot my podcast. Many episodes about this topic, and a lot of other things directly congruent to it. <a href="https://everythinghertz.com/" target="_blank">https://everythinghertz.com/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>So many questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What do you think is the future for predatory journals? Should Beall's list make a comeback?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think reviewers should be paid for their time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there a better measure for a journal than impact factor?</p>
</li>
<li>Will scientific funding ever really allow for robust replication studies?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are there any concerted efforts or guidelines to make sure that peer review is handled promptly? This is both an issue in terms of people agreeing as a reviewer and then not prioritizing it, and also the risk of potentially competing teams meaning that someone can be slow in peer review to delay another team. I realize this carries with it the challenge that peer review is unpaid.</p>
<p>Second question: Do you think the tendency in some fields to not consider work too similar to existing work to be publishable carries with it some risk, as independent attempts can help to determine if the first work/discovery was reliable or not? It seems like having two teams that discover a similar thing independently has a benefit, but journals seem to require things to be more novel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
