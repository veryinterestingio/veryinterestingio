		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As Cherenkov radiation has already been mentioned, the problem with any object going faster than the speed of light (in a vacuum) is that the math breaks down. The Lorentz factor (gamma) shows up in a lot of the equations of special relativity, and it's equal to:</p>
<p>1 / sqrt( 1 -  v^2 / c^2 )</p>
<p>When velocity v is equal to the speed of light c, v^2 / c^2 becomes 1, the denominator becomes zero, and the Lorentz factor ends up with a divide by zero error. One of the implications of this is that it takes infinite energy just to accelerate something to the speed of light, meaning it's an insurmountable barrier.</p>
<p>Of course, even if you found some way to circumvent that barrier and instantaneously skip acceleration through the speed of light, when v is greater than c, v^2 / c^2 is greater than 1, so you're taking the square root of a negative number. Plug that into an equation and it's going to start spitting out results that don't have any physical meaning that we know of, like a particle with imaginary mass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is important to know that &quot;breaking&quot; the sound barrier does not cause the sonic boom. It is that parts of the plane are going exactly the sound barrier for at least s short period of time. You can think of it as making a noise and as the air vibration is leaving, you make more noise at the front of the wave front since you are travelling at the same speed and a larger wave is formed. </p>
<p>Based on the air flow, different parts of the plane have different air pressure and so different speed of sound so you can gat shock waves from part of the aircraft.</p>
<p>Light is completely different. If you go .9999999999999C (in a vacuum) , the photons  leaving the front of you (in your reference frame) are still traveling away from you at C (the speed of light).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's something they has been nagging me. Prior to Chuck Yeager actually breaking the sound barrier, there were people who said it was impossible to do so. </p>
<p>I even recall reading people providing some math that showed it couldn't be done. </p>
<p>What makes the speed of light different? How can we be confident that it's impossible to surpass it?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
