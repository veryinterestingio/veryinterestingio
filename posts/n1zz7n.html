		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It mostly has to do with the way radio receivers work. </p>
<p>It uses something called a <em>phase-locked loop</em>.</p>
<p>Basically, once your car has found the signal it &quot;locks&quot; to it which makes the signal clearer even though you might get a few disruptions here and there. This is why you are able to keep hearing the station even after you are in the tunnel a bit. The signal is very weak but your car knows what to do to boost it. </p>
<p>But after you completely lose the signal you are going to need a good strong signal to re-lock to the station.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If you listen to Sirius XM on two devices in your house they won’t be in sync because of the buffer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This same system can also be used to hijack the frequency of cars in the tunnel to alert of local emergencies such as tunnel fires and car crashes.</p>
<p>Doesn’t answer your question but thought I’d still share cause it’s cool lmao</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Especially with modern radios it takes a bit of time for the radio to start playing the audio after you have technically regained the signal. This is because it will constantly be seeking for radio stations and when it finds it then it have to make sure to get it tuned inn right. With digital radio it is even worse then with analog radio as it will have to synchronize with the signal in order to decode it. There might also be some buffering in the radio intended for error correction as the digital signal might send out corrections for those radio sets that do not have a perfect signal but this requires that the data gets buffered up a bit. This will cause the audio to play from the buffer for a few seconds after you lost signal and also for the audio to take a few seconds to fill the buffer and do the error correction when you regain the signal before it starts playing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
