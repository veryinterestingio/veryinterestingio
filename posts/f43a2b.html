<p>In our evolutionary history, at what point did this become common?</p>
<p>As a follow up question, do we have any evidence of a rapid population growth due to increased year-round fertility of a hominid or precursor species?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not just great apes either, at least some old world monkeys have similar cycling (rhesus monkeys for example).</p>
<p>Kind of informed speculating here but I think two things are going on.  First, most primates live in fairly nonseasonal habitats and food availability is fairly constant year round.  Animals in these environments are less likely to have strong breeding seasons.  This is likely enhanced by the long parental care primates provide: if you have an infant around for a year, there's less reason to ensure it's born at exactly the right time since it's going to be a baby through all the seasons anyway.  </p>
<p>The actual length of the cycle isn't remarkable for a nonseasonal mammal as far as I can tell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human Physiologist here: Gosh I wish I knew. I can say that the endocrine pattern of human females is the best metric of fertility periods and that it's really hard to measure or estimate post-mortem.  I believe I was taught that the once-annual fertility period was replaced with the &quot;short cycle&quot; fertility period somewhere between the evolution of Australopithecus to the Homo (As in Homo Sapien) genus but I don't know how or why. Looking at other mammals it seems to have evolved contingent upon reliable resource availability and the shortening of gestation period.  I credit u/dusmeydin with a great question. If there are any verified Evolutionary Biologists (possibly u/bjornostman or u/DrDorris ?)  hopefully they can help you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From some of the research that I've read it, in hunter gathering societies the monthly ovarian cycle isn't as normal. </p>
<p>What I was reading was that most hunter gathering societies lactation would delay the ovarian cycle till the woman/family was ready to have another baby. So a woman may lactate for 2-3 years and only have her period after she was done breastfeeding.</p>
