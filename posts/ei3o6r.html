		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are creating a nucleation site and allowing bubbles to more easily form.</p>
<p>Clean water can have difficulty coming to a boil if the container it is in is very smooth and uniform.  Adding a material different than the container, such as a spoon or piece of spaghetti, to the hottest region of the pot (nearest the stove), gives the water an irregular area where bubbles can more easily form.</p>
<p>In extreme cases, water can become superheated and the smallest vibration or something falling into the container can cause it to explosively come to a boil and geyser out of the container.</p>
<p>A similar effect can be seen in candymaking.  You can have a supersaturated sugar solution that stays liquid.  Drop a few grains of solid sugar into the pot or scratch the side of the pot with a spoon and the whole thing suddenly crystallizes because you’ve provided nucleation sites.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT TO COLLECT THE ANSWERS TO THE MOST COMMON FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p><strong>What?</strong></p>
<p>Nucleation sites are where the change of state (liq-&gt;solid or liq-&gt;gas) occurs.</p>
<p>When everything is exactly the same, it can be hard for such a site to appear.  However, if there are slight (microscopic) impurities, these can disturb the system just enough to lower the energy for the phase change.</p>
<p>If you have very pure water and keep adding heat uniformly (such as a microwave), everywhere in the solution has the same energy and no one area preferentially wants to become the first bubble site.</p>
<p>If you have a supersaturated sugar solution, it wants to crystallize because it is too saturated but no one area preferentially wants to form that first seed crystal.</p>
<p>You can help such a system by disturbing it and giving it that first area that is slightly different where the phase change can start.  After that, the disturbance spreads as bubbles form or sugar crystals form.</p>
<p><strong>How can I fix my cookware to prevent this or why don’t manufacturers do something about this?</strong></p>
<p>Usually, you shouldn’t have to force this disturbance.  Your cooking pot, beer glass or mixing bowl already has micro scratches on the surface.  Boiling, carbonation bubbles or sugar crystals all start on these without help, most of the time.</p>
<p>If you want to control where your water boils, in an attempt prevent boil overs, cookware companies make ceramic “pot minders” that cause most/all of the bubbles to form on the surface of the ceramic, instead of across the whole bottom of the pot.</p>
<p>Some beer and sparkling wine companies make glasses with intentional etching on them.  This causes most of the carbonation bubbles to form in a certain pleasing place and stream to the top, instead of forming randomly all over the inside of the glass like you see in Sprite ads.</p>
<p><strong>Is this the same thing that causes rapid freezing when you touch a water bottle you forgot in your car in the cold?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.  The water was ready to freeze, it just needed a small disturbance to break the stalemate of where the first ice crystal would form.</p>
<p><strong>Is this the same thing that causes mugs of microwaved water to becomes traps for the unwary when they go to add powdered coffee or teabags?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.  The water was ready to boil, it just needed a small disturbance to break the stalemate of where the first bubble would form.</p>
<p><strong>ELI4</strong></p>
<p>Your water is ready to become steam, but it needs a little push to help it over the finish line.  </p>
<p>You can help either the most energetic water (closest to the stove) or all of the water if it is all ready (microwaved water) to become steam by giving it an easy place to start the change from.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While there's the best kind of answer here in another thread, the technically correct kind, I'll supply another way to look at it that's a little simpler and slightly less correct...</p>
<p>You have a pot of boiling water. It doesn't want to change state very much because it's somewhat stable.</p>
<p>Scraping it or tapping it causes vibrations which break the stability, and causes the first bubble, which breaks the stability more, and so on.</p>
<p>The second possibility here, is that you're touching the bottom. You're displacing material in contact with a hot surface, which can locally increase the temperature (hot spot) which causes that little bit to break down, boil off and start the above reaction as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For some scientific purposes, boiling should be avoided. Some substances should not be shaken when heated for safety reasons, and so on.</p>
<p>We use boiling stones (little bits of ceramic with random edges) that encourage boiling. This is so that we don't get pockets of superheated water that suddenly boil over and shake or splash out of the container.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two reasons: (1) pressing the bottom of the pan with a spoon may cause the bottom of the pan to make better contact with an electric heating element, enhancing the rate at which heat transfers from the heating element to the pan. (2) placing the spoon at the bottom of the pan makes a small space in which the rate at which the water circulates is reduced, causing that water to rise in temperature more than the surrounding region, reaching to boiling temperature before the remainder of the pan's water.</p>
<p>(3) When the spoon is in the water, not touching the bottom, the number and character of the nucleation sites is the same as when the spoon touches. The overwhelming number of answers regarding nucleation sites are just wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
