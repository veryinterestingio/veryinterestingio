Would we know each star's velocity without the reference point of a 3rd object?  If they are rotating around each other to the point where they are always the same exact distance from each other would we even know, or as far as we knew they would be considered to not be moving/not have any velocity?</p>
<p>If there were only one object in the universe, let's say me, am I effectively not moving, or would there be any way to tell I'm moving and in what direction?</p></div></div>

They are all equally correct and there is no such thing as a reference frame thatâ€™s wrong.  Usually people just pick whatever one makes the math easier.</p>

<p>they are moving away from each other at different velocities</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not a meaningful statement. One is at a point r1, the other at r2, and their recessional velocity is how their separation, |r1-r2|, changes in time, simple as that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>or would there be any way to tell I'm moving and in what direction?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, this is something absolutely fundamentally baked into physics, which is called the principle relativity. You can't tell if you're in a non-accelerating frame. Or more correctly, there is no &quot;right&quot; answer as to whether is stationary or in motion at a constant speed, different reference frames will say different things on that issue but all are equally valid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This though experiment is used to introduce students to relativity.  Add in a constant speed of light and some trigonometry and you have the special theory of relativity.  The upshot is velocity is relative so both stars would be equally correct to say they are stationary and the other is moving.  The laws of physics are identical and produce the same results from both perspectives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If they are rotating around each other</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Acceleration is not relative and rotation is a form of acceleration.  If you and I are the only two objects in the universe and you are accelerating towards me you couldn't say &quot;I'm actually stationary, you're the one that is accelerating!&quot; because there are physical effects that you experience and I do not.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>or would there be any way to tell I'm moving and in what direction?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nope.  You could be stationary, moving to your left at 10,000km/h, or any other constant velocity.  It's all relative.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially no. You can pick 'any' frame of reference and the two stars can have arbitrary speeds relative to you and your frame as long as their relative velocity is the same. It is equally valid to say either star is stationary and the other is moving away as they are both moving away from each other.</p>
<p>Again movement has to be defined. If you are the only object in the universe there is not really anything for you to move relative to</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Moving is defined as &quot;changing your position relative to some other point&quot; so if there is no other point in the universe, you can't really be said to be &quot;moving&quot;. It's not necessarily that you <em>aren't</em> moving, just that it's a nonsensical question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
