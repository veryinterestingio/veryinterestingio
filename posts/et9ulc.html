		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They basically describe the same thing, different solid structures for the same material, except allotropy is only for a single element while polymorphism refers to things like alloys and polymers. Graphite and diamond are <em>allotropes</em> of carbon, while calcite and aragonite are <em>polymorphs</em> of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). I’m pretty sure allotropes could also be called polymorphs, they’re just a special case.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just because nobody has pointed out this sort of example, although it is implied, polymorphism isn't limited to simple minerals or monatomic structures. Paclitaxel, for example, has an amorphous (anhydrous) and a dihydrate form, with different physical properties as determined by TGA or calorimetry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wow. Just gave a presentation about NiTi this week and had this come up. Allotropy necessitates that the material comprises atoms of only one element. Polymorphism does not. Not sure if allotropy can be considered a type of polymorphism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Polymorphism can be very weird.  About 10 years ago, I read, years later, of a drug manufactured at a factory that crystallized in a particular form.  One day, it started to crystallize in a different form, and they could no longer make the original crystal structure.  They cleaned the factory thoroughly, and though that helped for &quot;awhile&quot;, it went back to the second, later crystal structure.    At some point later, other factories around the world had the same thing happen to them, as if this was some sort of &quot;virus&quot; effect.  </p>
<p>I don't know if this was the drug I read about:   <a href="https://www.allfordrugs.com/polymorphism/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.allfordrugs.com/polymorphism/" target="_blank">https://www.allfordrugs.com/polymorphism/</a></a> </p>
<p>&quot; In 1996 Abbott launched on the market an effective protease inhibitor Norvir® that had cost the company in excess of $200 million to develop. The drug was formulated as an encapsulated ethanol/water solution. In the summer of 1998, supplies of the drug were interrupted by the appearance of a new crystal form (polymorphism) at a plant in the USA and then later at a plant in Italy. This new, more thermodynamically stable polymorphic form had very different physical properties than the earlier material and Abbott was forced to withdraw the drug from sale. The new form failed dissolution tests and precipitated out within the capsules. The company lost an estimated $250 million in sales as well as hundreds of millions of dollars trying to recover the original polymorph while the product was off the market. No doubt many AIDS sufferers were not helped by the product’s absence. What appeared to have happened was that a degradation product obtained during manufacturing had initiated the appearance of a second crystalline form, a second polymorph. &quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
