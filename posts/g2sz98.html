<p>Blurry vision, ringing in the ears, dizziness, nausea, upset stomach, tiredness, and a whole variety of other potential symptoms.</p>
<p>Treating it like a simple headache isn't appropriate because it's not just a matter of dealing with the pain, you also have to treat the symptoms and the root cause of a migraine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Migraine is a persistent physiological disorder involving blood vessels along the brain.  It's more akin to epilepsy than &quot;a headache&quot;.  It's there, waiting to be triggered.  Semantically speaking, you don't get migraines as much as you have migraine, and get migraine attacks.</p>
<p>The headache is a frequent part of a migraine attack, but not the only, or even a required part.  The problem in classification comes from the overlapping of various types of headaches, including those caused by migraine.  For example, stress can be a source for all kinds of headaches, as well as a trigger for migraine.  How stress triggers things can be different though.  Generally speaking, with migraine, stress raises blood pressure, which triggers the attack.  With other headaches, it can be blood pressure, a matter of pinched nerves from muscle tension, or other things.  Then there are things like soy protein, something about it will trigger some people (my wife for example), but have nothing to do with any other kind of headache (unless they're an allergen).</p>
<p>How to differentiate, when the causes are so myriad and overlapping, are the other symptoms people have already mentioned.  But even then, like I said about headaches not being a mandatory component, it's not always the same.  I didn't get diagnosed as a migraineur because of frequent headaches.  I was diagnosed because of the things that accompanied those headaches.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a medical perspective migraines aren’t classified separately from headaches. They are instead a classification within headaches. There are three primary headaches:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tension type (what may be consider “headaches” in layman’s terms)</li>
<li>Migraine type</li>
<li>Cluster type</li>
</ol>
<p>Each presents differently and occurs fr commonly in different people/under different circumstances, but all are, in fact, headaches.</p>
<p>Edit: these are considered primary types, where as “secondary headaches” have another underlying identifiable cause, such as a space occupying lesion, like a tumor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After years of suffering mild/moderate migraine, I got my first hemiplegic migraine last year. Everyone including myself and the paramedics thought I was having a stroke. It started with blurry vision and then my speech got funny, I could form a word/response sloooowly in my head but couldn't say it out loud, my answers were just gibberish noises. After a while, my jaw got stiffened, I couldn't open my mouth anymore. At the same time, half of my body felt like it was paralyzed. They rushed me to the hospital, do a bunch of scan to try to find the blood clot in my brain. Never found one. At the end, the ER doctor told my husband she probably just had the worst migraine in her life so far.</p>
<p>After that one horrifying episode, I had migraine daily for a couple months. It was a very stressful time in my life, lots of stuffs happened at once so I guess stress was the trigger. Once I got things in order, it came back to its &quot;regular&quot; cycle of 2-3 migraine per month. Amitrax/sumatriptan does help me to a degree. I would say stress and hormone are my biggest triggers. Other than that, lack of sleep and excessive intake of salt and MSG in food also can trigger the migraine.</p>
<p>During my migraines, I'd be very sensitive to sound, light, touch and temperature fluctuation. I'd be very tired, have no energy, nauseous, usually have a stiff neck, feel dizzy, lost balance and of course in pain from the headache. If you try to comfort a person who is experiencing migraine, I'd offer a dark, quiet and cool place for them to lay down, give them cold water, pain medicine and some chilled juicy chunks of fruits to suck on. The fruits definitely my favorite, I usually got to nauseous to eat so the sugar and cool sensation of the fruits would &quot;wake&quot; me up a little. Also encourage them to rest and sleep. </p>
<p>I hope my experience can help some of you identify your own symptoms. Stay safe!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
