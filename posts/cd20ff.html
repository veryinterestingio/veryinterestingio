They decide to have a visa free travel for both sides to encourage growth and lessen burdens on your everyday travellers. Hope this helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine that a passport is just a piece of paper that says &quot;I, (country), certify that this person is (personal info)&quot;</p>
<p>Other countries then decide how much to trust that letter. In most cases, it's based on an agreement that they will treat the other people a certain way. </p>
<p>If the trust is high, then other governments will just wave them through, like Canada and the US. Both countries are wealthy enough that passports can be issued with caution, and passports are generally hard to fake. There's also the fact that border agents see a TON of passports from the other country, and can quickly assess whether it's real or not. </p>
<p>Kyrgystan and Colombia, on the other hand, have far less basis for trust with each other - both are relatively poor countries with lots of corruption, so getting a real passport for a fake person is easier than it might be elsewhere. There are also probably very few of these seen in the other country, so a border agent in Colombia would have no easy way to figure out a fake passport. </p>
<p>This means that people from lesser known, poorer, or more corrupt countries would have to apply for a visa to travel, which is basically the other country having time to verify personal details before letting them in. </p>
<p>A big part of it is power, as well. America is able to coerce just about any other country to make American passports acceptable, because you don't want to annoy the world's wealthiest country, and accepting their passports is relatively low risk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Each individual nation decides what the requirements will be for each other nation. Often they negotiate with each other. Many factors are taken into account, but it's also highly political. For example, sometimes, if one country starts requiring visa for residents of another country, the other country will punitively respond by imposing a visa requirement of its own. Groups of nations such as the EU will make visa free zones to facilitate trade and relations. Wealth of the country is taken into account; residents of a wealthy country have less motivation to illegally immigrate, so it's considered less in need of travel restrictions. Things like crime rates and terrorism may also be taken into account.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Each country decides who can get in without a visa. It's often based on a reciprocal agreement - we'll let your people in if you let our people in. </p>
<p>Or based on economic reasons. If you're trying to develop a tourist economy or attract foreign business investors, you will generally want it to be easier for people to get into your country. </p>
<p>Or alternatively, they may want to restrict people from certain countries for economic reasons because they don't want people from poor countries easily getting in looking for work. </p>
<p>So, in general, the countries with the most &quot;powerful&quot; passports will be fairly wealthy with stable governments that are on good terms with the rest of the international community - Singapore, Japan, South Korea, USA, Western Europe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tossing this in, the modern concept of visas and passports is a relatively new concept.  Started after WWI.</p>
<p>Passports have existed in many forms prior to WWI.  There use became less in Europe as train networks expanded. Vast numbers of travelers began crossing borders with little ability for countries to enforce them.</p>
<p>After WWI, more formal passport/visas systems started to develop to what we see today.</p>
<p>As others have noted here, the use of visas and requirements for entry became based on relationships between countries with various factors.</p>
<p>Asymmetry is common.  For example, I'm in the US. For me to travel to Turkey as a visitor, I pay about $20 online or at the point of entry for a visa that is valid for 4 months with stays no longer than 90 days (as of 2015 for my last trip there). For Turkish residents to come into the US, it's a little more effort to get the visa, but the US would grant it for a period of 10 years (again, as of 2015).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
