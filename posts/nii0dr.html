		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the movies, when theres a fight or a game etc, sometimes there is a crowd of people frantically waving money and one guy is collecting it. The only example I can think of right now is in Hot Shots 2, the fight scene in the beginning. The &quot;judge&quot; guy starts the fight before he proceeds to collect money from the cheering crowd.</p>
<p>Ive seen that kind of betting in other movies. </p>
<p>But how does that kind of betting work? How is there any oversight over who bet with what against who?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the scene is filmed accurately you will see the people collecting money also have a small pad and pencil writing down info. When you first walk in you would be given a number or code like at an auction. So he would write real fast something like 21-$100/blue (or whatever they wanted to use to identify the fighters.</p>
<p>In most movies being more accurate would also slow down the action so its usually not shown correctly. It just wouldnt be as exciting to see the fighters standing there for 10 min while they collect all the info and money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When they say 2 to 1 odds for Red. It means if you give $100 dollars and you bet that Red fighter is going to lose and he loses you will get $200 dollars.</p>
<p>Basically they bet that their fighter (or some fighter) is better and stronger than the opponent and they offer to double or triple your money if they are wrong. All you need to do is accept the bet and put down some money.</p>
<p>Now in reality  they quickly write down that info on small paper and give it to you like a receipt and proof you paid money and made a bet so that if you win you can show it and collect your money. That is how they keep track of how much people bet and how much they earned/lost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends - there are types of betting. Parimutuel is where you bet against everyone else in the pool, like in horse racing. After all bets are in, payout is calculated based on who bet for which outcome, and the odds change up until the event starts. The house makes money by just taking a small percentage of the overall pot before payout.</p>
<p>Other is fixed odds, where you arenâ€™t betting against the others but against the house. The house just sets the odds so that it can recover over long periods of time and a lot of different bets.</p>
<p>There are variations and a their methods too, and a lot of nuance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There isn't much oversight except the bit where <em>&quot;We will beat the living shit out of you if you don't pay out to the winner.&quot;</em></p>
<p>You need to remember who put down money on who, so that you can pay out to those who betted on the right winner at the end. Either make good notes or have a veeeeeery reliable memory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That kind of gambling is typically what I call &quot;one versus&quot; betting: someone to make a bet, another person or a people to put money the other option. </p>
<p>Say you have a $20 bill and you go to boxing match with a friend, it's red shorts black gloves versus blue shorts white gloves. Another spectator next to you says &quot;I've got $20 that red shorts black gloves wins this fight.&quot; Spectator has made the terms for the bet: $20 on RSBG. If you agree with that, you don't put any money against it but if you think blue shorts white gloves is going to win, you can take that bet and put your $20 against it. If your fighter wins, you get his $20. If his fighter wins, he gets your $20.</p>
<p>Edit: you can have a 3rd party hold onto the money and give it to the winner after the contest has determined an outcome so people can't go running away from their bets if it doesn't work out in their favor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
