What I'm wondering is what happens after the injection and before one is said to likely have some protection from symptomatic Covid-19 (~10d, according to trial data). In other words, why does it take that many days to have some effective immune response? Doesn't the immune response to actual Covid-19 infection mount sooner?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your immune system will recognises the protein as foreign and will begin to produce antibodies via B cells or produce T cells that will recognise virally infected cells, but I will focus of the B cell response. Initially these antibodies have low affinity for the viral protein. The B cells will then migrate the local Lymph node whereby they will rapidly divide and undergo extensive mutagenesis. These random mutations will then either increase or decrease the affinity for the viral protein. The ones with higher affinity will receive positive feedback and then undergo further rounds of mutagenesis and the process repeats until you have very high affinity antibodies. During this process the antibodies will change their class meaning they have different characteristics and can interact with different arms of the immune system in different ways from their low affinity ancestors. The high affinity antibodies will be produced by B cells that have matured into plasma cells which are highly efficient antibody factories which will pump them out all day off need be. This all takes time to achieve so from the initial injection there is significant changes required in the immune system until you see the full effect of the vaccine. The second dose will then reinforce this response and the B cells will go through this whole process again.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A typical immune response (ie creation of detectable antibodies) takes 5-7 days. The trial dataset won’t show any statistically significant decrease in presence or severity of disease until sometime after that. I’m surprised it showed a difference in infectivity after only 10 days, which bodes well for its effectiveness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the underlying biology, you have to consider the clinical trial design and the practical nature of detecting an infection. Because there isn’t standard testing throughout the period, and because you do not get sick immediately upon infection, a new infection will only be detected ~3-5 days after the patient actually contracts the virus, when they become symptomatic and go in for testing. So the infections seen on day 9 probably began on day ~4-6, etc. This means efficacy starting on day 10 would pretty perfectly align with a 5-7d window for starting antibody production.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have two immune systems - the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. The innate immune system does not respond to specific antigens, but instead responds to pathogen or damage associated “patterns.” While it is not as specific and potent as the adaptive system, it is much more fast acting. The innate system initiates inflammation, trying to mitigate damage and sequester the pathogen while simultaneously recruiting dendritic cells, a type of antigen presenting cell. This takes some time, contributing to the overall time to efficacy you’ve mentioned. I’m just using dendritic cells as the example for an antigen presenting cell since it’s most common, but I should mention there are more types of antigen presenting cells that could play a role. Sometimes, adjuvants are included with the vaccine to ensure this occurs and ensure the response is potent, as adaptive immune responses need this dendritic cell recruitment to occur.</p>
<p>The dendritic cell is the bridge between the innate and adaptive response. It takes up proteins (or mRNA which is translated into proteins) and breaks them up into peptides (protein fragments). These peptides are the potential antigens and the cell presents the antigen on its surface. The activated dendritic cell then travels to the nearest lymph node, finally initiating the adaptive response. I’m already two paragraphs in and haven’t even mention T and B cells, so you can see why adaptive responses take some time. But they are very specific, very effective, potent, and long term so it’s certainly worth the wait and certainly worth the vaccination.</p>
<p>Adaptive immune system: In lymph nodes, there are a wide assortment of naive (not yet activated by its antigen) T and B cells reactive to all sorts of antigens. The dendritic cell presenting the antigen tests out these cells until finding one reactive to the antigen. For example, if the T cell receptor binds strongly enough, that is indicative of the T cell being reactive to that antigen. Antigen-reactive T and B cells are activated and then begin to expand (multiply in number) and migrate throughout the body. Activation, expansion, and migration all take time, contributing to the overall efficacy time you mention. Each type of cell in this response has its own function. Helper T cells orchestrate the response: they cause inflammation at sites with the antigen (recruit macrophages), activate killer T cells, and most importantly with coronavirus, allow the activated B cells to produce different classes of antibody (I.e. not just IgM, but also IgG and IgA, which is what we’ve been waiting for the whole time). Finally, you have your antibodies and long lasting immunity that the vaccine promised. The second shot is a booster vaccine and just makes your future responses better, as it increases your baseline levels of antibody.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tldr; needs time to figure out what it is. mRNA degrades naturally. Even once figured out, needs practice to remember. 2nd shot is a booster to help make sure results stick.</p>
<p>Edit 2: at the top cause it's important. The immune system is being trained on the proteins that the mRNA vaccines code for, not the mRNA itself. All of the rest holds up.</p>
<p>To put it in lay-person speak, the immune system is like that children's game with different shaped blocks and different shaped holes. Remember, the immune system isn't smart. It doesn't have eyes or a brain, it's just chemistry.</p>
<p>So, when the mRNA in either of the 2 major vaccines is put into our bodies our immune system can tell it's not supposed to be there. Step 1 is to try things it already knows how to make. The proteins for producing common antibodies are already coded for and waiting to be used, so they start with those.</p>
<p>Going back to the blocks idea. We see a block we haven't seen before, so we pick it up and try to put it in a hole, but it doesn't fit.</p>
<p>So, after its attempted the fast immune response, and failed, the slow immune response is up next. (Initiates at about the same time, just takes longer). Here, it'll try to randomly make new things to see if it can grab hold of this new invader. Of course, it's just chemistry, so it's not completely random, it's just modified versions of things we already had.</p>
<p>Back to the block example. We start to observe the new block a bit more. We can see it's got some flat edges and some corners. It might be a square, a rectangle, maybe a star, or a hexagon. We don't know yet for sure, so we keep trying the block in more holes.</p>
<p>After awhile mRNA will just begin to break down. It's not stable, and we do have mechanisms for breaking it down, they're just not generally used for immune responses. If after 10d or 3 weeks, however long the gap between shots is, our bodies haven't had enough time to figure out how to effectively identify and destroy the mRNA's products yet, then we need a booster shot to keep the volume of mRNA available for testing new antibodies on in high supply.</p>
<p>Even if some of our immune cells have figured out how to identify the invader, it may be so few that it won't help, or there may be so little left to use the technique on that the immune cells will forget what they did.</p>
<p>So to go back to the blocks again, if we manage to get the shape in the right hole, but then stopped using that block, we may forget what hole it goes in and have to start the process all over. But, if we use it again and again, and practice makes perfect, we'll remember next time we see that shape, just what hole it fits in.</p>
