		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simply put, pathogenic species for humans tend to thrive on the lower end of human body temperature. At higher temps, pathways needed for homeostasis become unstable for small organisms like pathogens, stamping out infections. That's why sick people tend to develop fevers. At too high of a temp tho, the body itself cannot regulate homeostasis, and weakens, which can lead to issues that increase susceptibility to infections. Lower body temps don't really kill pathogens, so while it isn't necessarily a disadvantage, the peaks of the susceptibility curves lie at the extremes of human body temps, with you probably wanting to lean on the warmer side.</p>
<p>Extra stuff: During an immune response, inflammation causes pyrogenesis in the body (in the form of increasing cellular metabolism, since metabolic rates are correlated with body temp) that disrupts small-scale functions. Of course, at high enough temperatures, this begins to chain into disrupting large-scale functions that the human host needs to survive, so fevers are good for your immune defense but only so much.</p>
<p>People at lower body temps normally would have to burn up a lot more energy to reach the same fever temperature since they would need to make up for that few extra degrees. This actually puts a lot of strain on the body's thermoregulation and homeostatic systems, which can cause a lot of issues. A big one is that most people who were operating at a lower body temp had a low resting metabolic rate. This usually coincides with something like malnutrition, comorbidities, homeostatic dysregulation, or even just old age- all of which make one more susceptible to diseases in a multilateral manner. This means if you're cold, you can't just huddle up in a blanket and except to lower susceptibility, but there is indeed a relationship between temperature and infection</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some pathogens don't grow well at higher temperatures (this is why the body causes a fever when it detects an infection). For example, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4295216/" target="_blank">chickens are not susceptible to anthrax</a> because their body temperature (41-43°C) is too high.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the 1927 Medicine Nobel Prize was awarded to Julius Wagner-Jauregg  for using malaria to cause a fever and kill other infections (notably syphilis). The malaria was then treated with quinine.</p>
<p>However, the temperatures required to inhibit pathogen growth are well outside the range of healthy body temperature variation. Immunity may be correlated with body temperature variation (for example, low-level immune system activation may raise the body's temperature), but I don't know of any examples where body temperature can directly affect infection risk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pathogens tend to have an ideal temperature that their enzymes work at, and so the body temperature shifting outside that range affects how virulent the pathogen is, or how fast it grows. The mycobacteria responsible for leprosy cannot grow at our standard core body temperature, which is why it goes for digits and places with poor circulation, like the nose.  A lot of mammals and birds run at a body temperature higher than ours, though, so there are pathogens that thrive at higher temperatures, which is why dogs still get their own set of diseases even though they run 101-102, which is a fever to humans. Pangolins and armadillos have a lower body temperature. Armadillos can also get leprosy when most other mammals can’t (and we used them to research the disease because of it). Bats are kind of in a weird group because their temperature goes above 101 when they fly, but down to close to ambient temperatures when they sleep or hibernate (as low as 40 F).  This is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4012789/" target="_blank">probably</a> what makes them really good at carrying zoonotic diseases because whatever virus infects them has to tolerate 106 in flight without going into senescence when the bat sleeps (because that’s prime time to find another bat to move to, when they’re all clustered together), and tolerance of a broad temperature range makes a virus better at jumping ship to a new host. With humans, there is the added complication that the body temperature measured by the thermometer (unless it’s rectal) doesn’t represent our actual core body temperature, so someone with a lower thermometer reading could have poorer circulation, which is also a potential factor in disease susceptibility.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On a side note, being dehydrated causes your temperature to rise. So If you drink a little too much during this whole pandemic (as many are), don't wake up and freak out if your temperature is higher than average. Go drink some water and gatorade and check it a few hours later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
