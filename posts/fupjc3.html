		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electric cars are like a dimmable light switch, as soon as you move the dial the light will turn on because electricity is pretty much instant and but more importantly its constant. </p>
<p>Petrol engines is like a kid pushing a heavy merry-go-round/roundabout. When a car is idling, the kid is only moving it with one hand with just enough force it spins. At this point the wheel has no torque and can be stopped easily. If you want to spin faster, it's going to take multiple pushes for the wheel to start spinning faster. Petrol engines are pulses of force from well timed series of explosions (internal COMBUSTION engine), not continuous force like electricity. You can hear the pulses easily on weed whackers. As you open the throttle you can hear the pulses get faster and closer together.</p>
<p>Now imagine a roundabout with 4 handles on it (like a compas, so you have a north handle, A east handle, bla bla bla). A petrol engine can only push on the north handle, so from a dead stop you have to push it hard enough so it spins all the way around which is kinda hard. Once you spin it and gain speed you can either add more weight and keep spinning at the same pace or let it spin by itself for a little until you need to push again. Because eletric cars are constant force, not pulses of force, you dont need to spin it by the handle; you can constantly apply force to make it spin.</p>
<p>The reason I said 4 handles is because a petrol engine runs on 4 cycles called suck-squeeze-bang-blow.
Bang- gas ignites and forces piston down spinning a crankshaft creating a lot of force/energy/momentum
Blow- the momentum pushes the piston back up clearing the cylinder of exhaust. This cycle creates no force/momentum/energy, but actually takes energy away.
Suck- piston goes down sucking in fuel/air. Again, takes energy, doesnt create anything.
Squeeze- piston goes up, requiring momentum to compress the fuel/gas so it may explode. If there is enough momentum to complete the squeeze part, the bang cycle will happen next creating a cycle. </p>
<p>The crankshaft then can send power to the wheels. If you send too much power to the wheels too soon that it cant complete the cycle, you will stop the cycle (kill the engine), otherwise you go back to the earlier problem will it take time to spin faster and faster with pulses.</p>

<p>Here you can see examples of the pulses. Cars use the 4stroke, weed whackers and similar small engines are 2 stroke</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the simplest reason is fuel based engines have a max torque at a specified rpm.  very common for today's vehicles to be around 5000 rpm for gasoline.</p>
<p>electric motors have all their torque available even from a stopped position.  so all that strength is available immediately from the get go, whereas an engine has to build up to the point of highest efficiency.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A petrol/diesel engine gets it's torque from a series of bangs. The electric engine gets it's torque from magnets constantly pulling on each other. To get torque up on a petrol engine, you need more bangs per time. EDIT: As u/PriorProject points out in a comment below, the only way to do this is to speed the engine's rotation speed up, and this takes some time.</p>
<p>The electric engine increases torque directly when you increase current through the electromagnets.</p>
<p>Note that a steam engine, while using cylinders and pistons, does have constant force, as the steam pushes on the cylinders all time (however, as the cranked axle rotates, the effective lever still makes torque vary a bit, hence why steam locomotives have trouble with <a href="https://youtu.be/5J91kqASNO4?t=215" target="_blank">wheel-slip</a>, it's rather spectacular)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because electric motors don't &quot;stall&quot; in the same way that combustion engines do.</p>
<p>An electric motor works by sending electricity through a coil of wire inside a frame of magnets (simplification). The electricity generates a magnetic field that pushes against the magnets in such a way that the rotor wants to rotate. Depending on the amount of power you give it, the opposing magnetic fields can generate a <em>lot</em> of force. If you've ever played with strong magnets, you've experienced how much force opposing magnetic fields have.</p>
<p>Uner &quot;stall&quot; conditions, an electric motor will consume its maximum current rating, and all of that energy is immediately available as rotational force on the rotor. In other words, torque. (some is also lost as heat, but I don't want to do math). While an electric motor is stalled, it's still consuming energy, and still applying force to the rotor. It will stay in this state until you cut power, the rotor is allowed to move, or the motor overheats and shuts off to protect itself.</p>
<p>Now, a combustion engine has an entirely different stall behavior. An engine relies on lots of mechanical parts moving around at just the right time in just the right sequence in order to keep itself going. If you've ever driven a manual transmission, you've almost certainly stalled the engine. If the torque needed to move the wheels is greater than the torque the engine can provide on that stroke, the engine simply stops. The next piston in line doesn't move up to the top of its cylinder, and the next combustion stroke isn't completed. It all just stops, and no more torque is being created.</p>
<p>In order to prevent a combustion engine stalling, we have clutches and gears designed to <em>reduce</em> torque. The engine <em>must</em> keep moving or it will stall, so we have to limit torque applied to the wheels to under what the engine can produce. On top of that, a combustion engine can generate more torque at higher speeds, but it's not super easy to start a car from a standstill with the engine already running at its peak speed.</p>
<p>To sum up, it's because electric motors generate torque through a static electromagnetic field, and combustion engines generate torque through a timing-sensitive series of explosions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Im new to this kind of thing but I think I can answer, sure others will have better answers.</p>
<p>With petrol/gas, the fuel is sent to the cylinders (which ultimately drive the wheels in a sense) which then goes through 4 strokes. Intake (of the fuel/air mixture), compression (of the fuel air mix), power (from the explosion), outtake (exhaust). These though fast, take time, average car has 4 cylinders all at a different part of the 4 strokes at a given time. The higher performance car, the more cylinders. Now I’m not into cars, but instead planes and your average general aviation plane has 4 cylinders which I can presume is what basic cars are like too. </p>
<p>With electricity, think of turning on a switch. Instantly, you have light. Transfer the same principle to cars.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
