<p>I want to say thank you for your show. My daughter is so excited to see a lady scientist on tv and she loves watching the experiments. </p>
<p>She always wants to do them (and I show her how to do as many as we can with what materials we have on hand), but I don't always have the money or access to some of the materials you use in your show (I couldn't figure out how to get some of the stuff for the lava lamp or the horse toothpaste, but I don't live in the US). Is there a website or a set of resources you have for doing some experiments on a budget?</p>
<p>Also do you have any advice for my budding little scientist on how to keep learning in the future?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, my daughter just binged your show this weekend and I couldn't be more thrilled. Outside of your fantastic show, what other channels/personalities/projects might you recommend to keep a young girl's interest in STEM going?</p>
<p>Lastly, because I love hearing other engineer's answers to this question: what's the last engineering design or mechanism you encountered that made you have to stop and marvel at it's ingenuity?</p>
<p>edit: Asked my daughter if she has a question for you, and without pausing she responds with &quot;where is her lab and ask her if I can work in her science lab after the virus is over&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
