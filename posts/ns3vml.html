		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>NB: The water analogy is great but doesn't explain the whole story. In the same way, my analogy works to explain a different side. Both aren't complete because, let's face it, electricity is pretty complicated.</p>
<p>Think of balls going through a chute <a href="https://www.fairwayproductsonline.co.uk/images/products/order_of_play_starting_rack_for_golf_course.JPG" target="_blank">like this</a>, but without the stop at the end. This chute is always filled with an <em>endless</em> amount of balls. They just keep pouring out.</p>
<p>The chute is quite horizontal and the balls don't really roll fast. You decide to pick up the upper end and raise it, so it stands up more. Suddenly, the balls pick up speed and go faster. The balls get more energy.</p>
<p>This angle, this is equivalent to the voltage, for which we use the unit <strong>volts</strong>.</p>
<p>Now go to lower end, take a stopwatch and count how many balls fall out in 10 seconds. 20, maybe?</p>
<p>The more balls come out during this time, the higher the current: the more <strong>amps</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, for power, remember how I said the balls get more energy? That's important, because you can do things like that, like move the pedals on your bike. If you take the amount of balls and the amount of energy each has and multiply it together, you get power: for which we use the unit <strong>watts</strong>.</p>
<p>Some might wonder why I explained it like this. The water analogy is easier. Well, this analogy also explains one other thing with electricity: charge. Every ball is an electron, which has charge. The unit for this charge is <strong>coulomb</strong>.</p>
<p>Electricity is electrons(balls) going through a conductor(chute), they go through with a certain energy(volts): the more energy it has, the more can go through in a shorter time(amps).</p>
<p>If we know how much energy each electron has and if we know how many balls pass through a conductor every second, we can calculate the energy passing through the conductor every second(watts).</p>
<p>EDIT: For everyone saying my analogy is not 100% correct, you're right. But remember this is ELI5, getting a rough grasp of the subject matter is more important than full accuracy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The three terms we actually need are volts, amps, and <em>resistance</em>, which is opposition to current flow (amps).</p>
<p>The reason we need these three terms to talk about electricity is because they are dependent upon each other.  If you have a known voltage, the amount of current that will flow is dependent upon the resistance.  More resistance = less current flow.  Less resistance = more current flow.</p>
<p>Power (in electrical terms) is the ability to do work, and is calculated by multiplying volts times amps.  It actually gets a little more complicated than that but that's the basic equation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><h2>Electricity :: Water</h2>
<p>Electricity is like the water in a waterfall that is spinning a mill wheel. You need two things to run the wheel: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>a lot of water.</p>
</li>
<li>for that water to be falling.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Waterfall Height :: Elecric Voltage</h3>
<p>Voltage is how tall the cliff is. You can get more power from each drop of water if it's a tall cliff, but that doesn't tell you if there's actually a LOT of water or not.</p>
<h3>Amount of Water :: Electric Current</h3>
<p>Amperage is current, it's how much water is actually flowing. It's how wide the waterfall is. More water means more power, probably, but you still need the water to actually be falling, otherwise it's a pond and you can't run a watermill with a pond.</p>
<h3>Wattage is Total Power, influenced by both amount of water (amperage, electrical current) and by the height the water is falling (voltage)</h3>
<p>Multiply the two together and you get wattage, which is how much power you actually are getting. How much that waterfall is actually going to move the watermill.</p>
<p>Niagara Falls is a huge river (current, or amperage) with a tall cliff (height or voltage). It could power a huge watermill.</p>
<p>A small but tall waterfall (low amp, high voltage) is useful, and so is a huge lazy river (low voltage, high amperage). A tiny lazy river (low amp, low voltage), not so much.</p>
<p>Final factlet: static built up on a balloon has really high voltage, but very low amperage. It's like someone hitting you with a single drop of water at really high speed. Doesn't actually hurt, but only because there isn't very much of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they are different things.  We aren't Squanchy speaking in squanch.</p>
<p>Voltage is the charge difference between two things. </p>
<p>Current is the flow of electrons, measured in Amperes.</p>
<p>Watts are the combined measure of the two for power. Volts x Amps = Watts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
