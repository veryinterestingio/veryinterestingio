<p>I did a google search and got pointed to this existing reddit post, and the top comment does a really good job explaining it in fairly straightforward way, albeit a slightly scientific way.</p>
<p>Here's the paraphrasing:</p>
<p>There are a couple of main possible reasons but more studies need to be done to know for sure.</p>
<p>The first is that when you lay down, you change your posture and subsequently the &quot;fluid balance&quot; which proceeds to settle into your sinuses.  Additionally, because you're asleep, you're not consciously or unconsciously blowing your nose or any other behavior that helps clear your sinuses.  So it all just settles in there and waits for you to wake up, at which point you're suddenly very aware of the changes since you were last awake and thus you're very miserable.</p>
<p>The second possible reason is due to our natural circadian rhythm, which is a phrase that basically means your internal clock which means your body knows to do things based on the time of day because it learned to (thanks to millions of years of evolution).  So our circadian rhythm also dictates even our immune functions, which are powered by the different parts of our bodies that help us battle illnesses and other things.  So basically, the idea is that during the day your body's ability to fight illness is naturally at its peak simply due to our internal clocks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It’s why our kids are too sick for school in the morning but by lunch are amping to go play, and you’re sure they’re going to school the next day. Then their fever returns after dinner - ? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of that &quot;sickness&quot; you get is really just a side effect of your nose dealing with mucus.</p>
<p>Basically when you sleep your nose gets stuffy, and then you just start breathing through your mouth. This lets your nose get really stuffy (putting pressure on your sinuses) and it causes you to breath through your mouth. That sore throat that you get is frequently causes from breathing through your mouth and drying out your throat, not from the cold.</p>
<p>As soon as you get up you sit vertical or stand, this allows your sinuses to drain, and you start blowing your nose to clear them. This relives pressure from your sinuses and lets your breath through your nose. Once you breath through your nose and start clearing your throat, your throat will quickly become less sore, it's also less tiring to breath through your nose. All of this quickly makes you feel better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
