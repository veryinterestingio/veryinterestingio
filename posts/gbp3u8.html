		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are fewer unique targets, since viruses mostly use our own cellular machinery. We end up having to target the few enzymes and proteins they have, such as viral proteases or reverse transcriptases. We can also sometimes produce neutralizing antibodies that target viral surface proteins, which opens up some new options, but even there we also have to be careful that the viral epitopes arenâ€™t too similar to human proteins. </p>
<p>In contrast, bacteria have whole suites of enzymes and proteins that are often unique or significantly different than their human analogs, so we can build compounds targeting them that are less likely to interrupt human cells.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Viruses rely on host cells for reproduction, so you have to interfere with their hosts cells and metabolic processes to impact their reproduction and spread.</p>
<p>In some senses fighting an infesting virus is like treating cancer wit Dr. Erlich's magic bullets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, viruses can't be killed, only deactivated, while bacteria are classified as living organisms that have sets of functioning systems that can be manipulated and blocked/shut down in order to kill the bacteria. However, viruses are classified as non-living due to the fact that they do not elicit any response, nor grow and replicate, outside of a host. It is the hosts systems (specifically the protein-synthesis systems) that are hijacked and used to produce viral proteins so the virus can replicate and spread. Thus, more extensive research needs to be done in order to understand the viral genetics, exactly what makes the virus what it is, as well as to be able to identify the proteins that the virus produces and the proteins that protect the virus (capsid). This is not only very expensive, but also very difficult as it's very likely going to cause some damage to the host as well, since it's the host systems that are being used. Hence, viruses are usually just waited out until the body's immune system targets the infected cells and kills them in order to stop the virus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simple answer is its alot easier to kill something that is actually alive. You can kill bacteria, its a living cell. Viruses arent cells, they are an inert package of genetic material that are absorbed by, and hijack living cells. Bacteria are a cell that attacks other cells, viruses take over cells, so you cant effectively kill bad cells infected with viruses without killing identical healthy cells that arent infected. </p>
<p>So the approach is completely different. You have to force healthy cells to reject the virus, to stop it from replicating instead of finding something that uniquely kills bacteria and not healthy cells.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others are correct that designing therapeutics that target viruses instead of bacteria is inherently harder, but the larger reason why he have more antibacterials than antivirals is that we didn't design most of the antibacterials. Most antibacterials used in medicine are natural products or derived closely from natural products. They are made by other microorganisms, including other bacteria, to wage chemical warfare for resources. Humans discovered these natural molecules and began purifying, concentrating, and strengthening them to use in medicine. Natural antiviral systems exist too, but they tend to be designed around proteins that act once a virus is inside a cell or organism so they are not as easily adapted as therapeutics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
