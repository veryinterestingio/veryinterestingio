		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because there’s already water in the ground. If you were to dig down beside the lake you’d hit saturated dirt at the same level as the surface of the lake. The level at which this occurs is the “water table.” Water flows under ground and levels out so if you dig a hole and keep the hole open, it will fill with water up to the water table. We call those holes “wells.”  </p>
<p>Of course nature is more complicated than that simple model, but that’s basically it. Rivers can lose water to the surrounding ground as they flow or gain water. Perched aquifers above the surrounding water table can occur when there are pockets of impermeable material holding water like a bowl. Those impermeable layers are called “aquatards.” If there is a lot of rain in an area the ground above the water table can be permanently saturated, but the water is moving downward to the water table. Coasts are more complicated when tides are involved. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The soil under and around many, many lakes is <em>fully saturated</em>, either <a href="https://cdn.britannica.com/s:300x300/88/62688-004-4754D9C9.jpg" target="_blank">like the light blue volume here</a>, or more <a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.grafika24.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Groundwater-in-the-underground.jpg?ssl=1" target="_blank">like this</a>, where we see some combination of rather impermeable layers under the lake.  In both cases, there is appreciable connection between the groundwater and the lake water... edit... such that net flow between these two systems isn't going to bring down the lake level any time soon.</p>
<p>Speaking of net flow, I like <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/u5835e/u5835e0d.gif" target="_blank">this image because it shows groundwater feeding a reservoir, which then feeds the same groundwater volume, which then feeds a river.</a>  </p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nathan_Waltham/publication/281003853/figure/fig1/AS:613853142454274@1523365402881/Schematic-cross-section-of-North-Stradbroke-Island-showing-the-location-of-Blue-Lake-as.png" target="_blank">when a lake is <em>immediately</em> underlain by an especially impermeable layer -- such as clay -- there might be roughly zero groundwater connection to the lake</a>.  These two little lakes are perched -- their inputs derive from rain, snow, and from overland flow, but not from the groundwater that feeds many other lakes.  Their only output is evaporation and maybe a little stream (which is probably matched by an input stream).</p>
<p>And as others have said, even if a lake is underlain by an enormous quantity of very porous material that <em>isn't</em> fully saturated, as long as the lake's inflow (e.g., rain and streams) matches what it loses (from its bottom and/or from an outlet stream and evaporation), the lake level will be rather steady.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Keep watering your plants. After a few moments, the water will start pooling. You’ve saturated the soil and the rate at which water is entering exceeds the rate at which it can drain away.  That’s basically how lakes form.  Water enters from rain, glaciers melting, streams, etc, and that exceeds the rate at which water can saturate the soil beneath it and water starts to pool until it overflows down some other stream</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you dig on the shore of the lake, you will hit water at lake level. Water naturally levels off so the water level of ponds and lakes at a a sort of equilibrium with the remaining water in the land. Some lakes have hard rock underneath, which water can’t seep through, which allows some lakes to exist at higher altitudes as well</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Water table information has already been given, but a slight expansion is to talk about the <em>rate</em> of flow. Imagine sucking through a straw the size of the gap between soil particles. It’s slow.</p>
<p>In general, the coarser the substrate (e.g. sand 10^-1 m/s) the quicker it drains. The finer, the slower (e.g. clay talking like 10^-7 to 10^-10 m/s). Clay is interesting because it’s formed of lots of small plates. This makes it difficult for flow to go down, and much easier for it to move sideways (imagine how milk splashes off your cornflakes).</p>
<p>But before i go off on any more tangents, in response to your question: if no more precipitation occurred, then lakes would, via evaporation, surface water flow (rivers) and groundwater flow (through soil/rock) completely dry out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
