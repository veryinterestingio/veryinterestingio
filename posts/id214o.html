		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work for the USPS and one thing we've been told this is all done to install new machines that are much faster at sorting mail. One thing that hasn't been reported is that they stopped running the machines that sort magazines (what we call flats) months ago and that has slowed us down a bunch. We are also already seeing Xmas levels of packages and we are all worried about what the busy season will bring. Amazon didn't have their summer Amazon day and pushed it to October. This makes our jobs much harder (lots of packages slow you down in the office and on the street) plus we will have LOTS more political ads at the time and ballots to deliver...this fall is going to be BAD.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not 100% on this but the reason I have seen quoted is the mail sorting machines were being removed to install new package sorting machines </p>
<p>The argument is that traditional mail volumes are down while package volume is up due to e-commerce. Installing package sorting machines en lieu of mail sorting machines should help cut down on overall operating costs</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The only reason the USPS has a &quot;budget problem&quot; is because, prior to 2006, it was about the only government program/service that was making more money than it was costing.  This looked bad to the Republicans, who wanted some excuse to privatize it so them could personally profit from it, not just have the money go to government surplus.  So in 2006 they enacted a law that said the USPS had to pre-pay employee pensions for the next 75 years, cutting them off from approximately 100 billion dollars of their operating budget to pay retirement for employees who aren't even born yet. If not for that, there would be no money troubles with the post office whatsoever.</p>
<p>As for removing the sorting machines and mailboxes... compare the major cities where this is happeneing to where Clinton was outperforming Trump in the 2016 race.  It's almost dead-even.  This is an open act of malevolence, making sure that Democrat-heavy areas can't vote against him.  Sure, this action also means that bill payments, vital medicines, and other stuff gets delayed or even prevented from being delivered where its needed, but he doesn't give a flying fuck so long as he gets re-elected and thus can avoid criminal prosecution for a few more years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It really doesn't. The official story is that it will &quot;help the budget&quot;, but the real reason is that shutting down mail sorting machines now in order to upgrade them to faster, more efficient units is a calculated effort to slow down and hobble the USPS by sowing distrust amongst the general public. If the average person starts to believe that they're not getting mail on time now, and may be missing some mail entirely, then how are they going to trust in the postal service to handle the influx of mail-in ballots come election time?</p>
<p>Even if new sorting machines are installed quickly, we can expect a significant slowdown from the same rubber band effect that's at play behind most major traffic jams, and that will resonate outward for months. This is a calculated attack on the postal service.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
