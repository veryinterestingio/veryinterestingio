		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are graduate students, staff, and faculty from the University of Washington Molecular Engineering and Science (MolES) Institute. Molecular Engineering is a new field; we were one of the first Molecular Engineering graduate programs in the world, and one of only two in the United States. Though MolES only opened in 2014, we have had many discoveries to share!</p>
<p>Molecular engineering itself is a broad and evolving field that seeks to understand how molecular properties and interactions can be manipulated to design and assemble better materials, systems, and processes for specific functions. Any time you attempt to change the object-level behavior of something by precisely altering it on the molecular level - given knowledge of how molecules in that &quot;something&quot; interacts with one another - you're engaging in a type of molecular engineering. The applications are endless! Some specific examples of Molecular Engineering research being done within the labs of the MolES Institute are:</p>
<ol>
<li>MolES faculty member and Chemistry professor Al Nelson developed a new way to produce medicines and chemicals and preserve them in portable, modular &quot;biofactories&quot; embedded in water-based gels known as hydrogels. This approach could enable access to critical medicines and other compounds in low-resource areas.</li>
<li>The Baker lab in MolES and Biochemistry is engineering artificial proteins to self-assemble on a crystal surface. The ability to program these interactions could enable the design of new biomimetic materials with customized chemical reactivity or mechanical properties, that can serve as scaffolds for nano-filters, solar cells or electronic circuits.</li>
<li>Bioengineering/MolES Institute Professor Kelly Stevens developed a new 3D printing approach to create biocompatible hydrogels with life-like vasculature - opening the possibility of printing living human tissue for things like organ replacement!</li>
<li>Researchers in MolES and Chemical Engineering professor Elizabeth Nance's lab are attempting to deliver therapeutics to the brain using tiny nanoparticles that can effectively cross the blood-brain-barrier in brain injury and disease.</li>
<li>As a MolES PhD student in Valerie Daggett's lab, Dylan Shea studies the molecular events that occur in the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease to better understand the structural transitions that take place in Alzheimer's-associated proteins. This knowledge will inform the development of diagnostic tests for early pre-symptomatic detection.</li>
<li>MolES PhD student Jason Fontana is working in the labs of James Carothers and Jesse Zalatan to develop tools that facilitate genetic engineering in bacteria for optimizing biosynthesis of valuable products.</li>
</ol>
<p>Molecular engineering is recognized by the National Academy of Engineering as one of the areas of education and research most critical to ensuring the future economic, environmental and medical health of the U.S. As a highly interdisciplinary field spanning across the science and engineering space, students of Molecular Engineering have produced numerous impactful scientific discoveries. We specifically believe that Molecular Engineering could be an exciting avenue for up-and-coming young scientists, and thus we would like to further general awareness of our discipline!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Obligatory &quot;I'm on mobile&quot; warning. Advanced formatting apologies.</p>
<p>Growing up, I wanted nothing more than to be a scientist. Specifically, I desired to work in research and development in biology. What you're all doing is what I imagined game-changing science to be. True sci-fi, manifest. I cannot begin to put into words how dangerous and beautiful and terrifying and hopeful I find this new field of study to be...</p>
<p>Two questions, if you'll indulge me:</p>
<p>Do any of you have any advice for a 30-something who always dreamed of being a scientist, but was derailed from their life plan by circumstances beyond their control?</p>
<p>What, if any work is being done within this field involving telomeres or telomerase?</p>
<p>Thank you all for forging the future. In a time where I feel like science itself is being attacked by large swaths of society, it brings me great comfort knowing the strides that are being made.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In what aspects do you think 3d printing a scaffolding to be repopulated by cells is more effective than using a decelularized organ human, animal or vegetal?
Seems like animal or vegetal have a strong availability of resources and that using vegetal tissue as scaffolding can allow to produce most shapes through sculpting like some researchers have done using apple to produce cartilage with the shape of an ear for example, in what aspects of the process is 3d printing an advantage?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
