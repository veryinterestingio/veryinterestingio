		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cancer are unregulated cells that don't follow their original function. This is often characterized by uncontrolled cell division, creating a tumor, or a clump of cells.</p>
<p>Now tumors can inhibit function several ways, the most common being applied pressure or waste products that can be bad for healthy cells.</p>
<p>Many cancers aren't particularly dangerous where they originate, but instead where they end up. Think breast and testicular cancer. While you might lose function of those organs, they aren't strictly necessary for survival.</p>
<p>The problem occurs when they break off (metastasis) and migrate to other parts of the body that are vital and inhibit their function. Think brain, heart, lungs. Many of those locations have specific functions and large tumors or bi-products of cancer cells can mess that up.</p>
<p>Edit- As u/Tdshimo said, resource stealing is another big reason why tumors hurt a localized area.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cancer is basically a single word humans use to describe any clump of cells that (for a large variety of different reasons) decide to go rogue and start multiplying instead of doing the jobs they are usually supposed to do to keep us alive.</p>
<p>Sometimes, if the clump of cells (which gets called a &quot;tumor&quot;) is small enough and all in one place, doctors are able to simply cut it out with surgery.  Other times, we'll try to use drugs (chemotherapy) or radiation to basically carpet-bomb everything around the cancer, with the hope that our remaining good cells can rebuild afterwards.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that carpet-bombing isn't always effective, because if we completely nuke everything we wont have enough surviving good cells to rebuild, but if too many rogue cells survived they can just go on rebuilding tumors instead.</p>
<p>When some of these rogue cells start setting up shop in a place like the liver or kidneys it can be trouble.  It's different from say a heart attack, or stopping breathing, but we still absolutely need our kidneys and liver to function properly to filter out the waste products our own body naturally produces.  If rogue cells hijack too many resources (like food, air, etc.) from our good cells so that our good cells no longer have enough energy to keep up with filtering out or processing all those waste products, then those waste products will start to accumulate in our blood stream and those waste products will end up basically poisoning everything.  That poisoning is what can eventually cause our heart or lungs or brain to fail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>My father passed away &quot;from&quot; bowl cancer Jan this year...
It was the morphine actually killed him (it was a sweat relief).
He had a full obstruction of the bowl and was in a lot of pain, the morphine wasn't really touching it, the doc who came to the house (he wanted to die at home) audibly noted that the new stat dose he was administering was &quot;at the upper limits of a non lethal dose&quot;... after the dose, he sort of went calm, then into a sleep and passed away...we was all by his side...the doc was visibly shaken, he knew what had happened, I shock his hand and thanked him, dad had suffered enough.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cancer is basically a cell that does not die, but instead keeps on multiplying AND the copies can travel through bodily fluids to different locations.</p>
<p>Death may finally occur by many mechanisms; here are a few...</p>
<ul>
<li>The cancer cells steal resources and suppress appetite making the patient severely malnourished. The sheer loss of body mass can itself be fatal.</li>
<li>Their muscles waste away till they cannot move even breathe or cough properly. Some may die of lung infections or choke on food.</li>
<li>The cancer or one of its deposits may eat through a blood vessel because of its rapid growth. The patient may bleed out fatally.</li>
<li>Cancers of hollow organs (intestine etc) can eat through the wall and lead to sepsis. </li>
<li>This is infection of the tumour itself leading to sepsis</li>
<li>The cancer deposits in organs can cause them to malfunction. Liver damage will lead to accumulation of toxins. Brain damage can lead to coma etc.</li>
<li>Deposits around the lungs cause fluid to accumulate and patient slowly becomes unable to breathe</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately death from any disease occurs via one of three modes - cardiac (heart unable to pump blood to feed your brain); respiratory (adequate oxygen cannot be provided) or brain (brain cannot signal the heart and lungs to function)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
