		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whales are evolutionary adapted to be so large to keep warm in cold water but also adapt to environmental changes around them while migrating. Due to massive geological changes whales developed fins, blubber, and baleen filters adapted to ocean dwelling. One part of adapting to ocean dwelling was eating small krill which whales could do easily with their baleen filter feeding system. But, the krill appeared in large amounts only at certain times of the year at different regions of the world during up-welling (nutrient turnover). This meant whales had to migrate long distances to get food, so to withstand these water temperature changes and have enough energy, whales needed to be large and full of blubber. The bigger whales were adapted to migration so natural selection favoured such whales and smaller whales were essentially unfavored. The larger whales were able to continue through generations over millions of years and that's why whales are so big.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apart from the answers already given, it is also helpful to look at other animals to compare. Convergent evolution took place (meaning they evolved with a different background to become the same kind of way other animals do. Famous example: bats and birds have the same kind of skeleton buildup to fly, although not originally build for the same purpose). Same may be to compare whales and dolphins with sharks. </p>
<p>When animals from land started to go into the water again, they evolved in such a way that it was still convenient to go up for air when needed + have a hydraulic body to adapt to water. </p>
<p>This means that heart, lungs, fat cells, muscles, limbs, even brain structure, etc. needed to be changed to adapt in such a way that it was convenient to still stay in water. When looked into the muscles, you can see that the muscles are mostly of dark brown color which indicates that more oxidative energy for long-term energy is used. Furthermore lungs are bigger, have a better oxidative exchange + the heart rate is lower (mouse has a very high heart rate, while an elephant has a low heart rate because of the size) what gives them more time to stay underwater. </p>
<p>Fat cells consist a lot of brown adipose tissue, which are meant to cause non-shivering thermogenesis (basicly means using less energy to keep warm), which is a huge investment to make into the body but in the whale a very good investment to make. </p>
<p>All these changes adapted into the body, made that it was more convenient to be of bigger size than of smaller size</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reasons for different whales differ, but for the largest whales the general thinking is that it has to do with breath holds - as whales grow larger, they are able to dive longer and  deeper, and collect more food during each dive. </p>
<p>For animals that prey on relatively deep water prey animals like krill, the extra food intake is enough to justify the energy cost of growing larger and diving deeper.</p>
<p>Based on recent modelling estimates, this puts a size limit on toothed whales. Sperm whales are roughly at the optimal size for hunting large prey. But the same modelling suggests that baleen whales could still get bigger. Blue whales are already the largest animal ever to live on earth, but in terms of these kinds of energy calculations, larger blue whales do better than smaller ones.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fundamentally, it's about one thing....how they eat.  There are toothed whales and baleen whales.  Toothed whales can be pretty big (especially sperm whales) but they aren't <em>outstandingly</em> big.  They are within the size range of numerous extinct marine animals and overlap with some living species of fish, pinnipeds, sirenians, and sharks.  </p>
<p>It's the baleen whales which are stupendously huge, bigger than all known extinct or living animals, and bigger than toothed whales.  The reason they can get so big is that they are filter feeders.  </p>
<p>Normal feeders, like toothed whales and most everything else, feed by catching single prey items.  But this takes some time, you have to chase down an individual fish or squid, grab it, and gulp it down.   But as you get bigger, this whole &quot;chasing down, grabbing, and eating&quot; process doesn't really get any faster while you still need more and more food to support yourself.  Sure you can go after larger prey (eg, tuna instead of anchovies), but they are also less numerous.  This ultimately limits the size of these animals.  Eventually they reach a point where they can't catch food fast enough to support more growth.</p>
<p>Baleen whales (and a few other filter feeders like whale sharks, but baleen whales do it the best) have a way around this issue.  Instead of chasing down single prey, they are able to engulf whole schools of prey at once.  And because the amount of prey they can catch is proportional to the size of their mouth, which is proportional to the size of their  body, the bigger they can get the more food they can get.  They can also keep hunting the more numerous small prey instead of bothering with the rarer large prey (this answers your other question: there's more food in the 1000 krill than the 1 mackerel).  With the feeding constraint loosened, baleen whales are free to get much larger than anything else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
