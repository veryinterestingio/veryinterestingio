		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OKay, let's say you're looking at an empty hourglass. There's nothing weird about it, it is just sitting there doing nothing. You can recognize the shape of it, you can see that it is not moving, or alive, or anthing weird like that. </p>
<p>Now, imagine that you have some kind of weird vision problem so that you can only see one thin horizontal slice of the hourglass at a time. So I show you the hourglass but you only see the slice right near the bottom. You don't see an hourglass shape, you just see this ring made out of glass. But still, nothing special, nothing magical. </p>
<p>But then, I start to slowly move the hourglass, and you start to see the slices that are higher up on the glass. Except again, you can't see the whole thing, you just see one thin slice. But to you, it now looks like that ring made out of glass is shrinking. It's getting smaller and smaller. And then, for no reason at all, it starts getting bigger again. You're freaked out, because you've seen glass before, and you've never seen it do something like that before. </p>
<p>These &quot;time crystals&quot; are basically like that. They look like they are moving or changing over time, and then changing back again. But we think what's really going on is that they just have this one static shape, but it exists in more dimensions than we can see. These crystals have a shape that stretches across the time dimension. And since we can only see one &quot;thin slice&quot; of time in any given moment, we only see one slice of this crystal at a time and those slices are not all the same. In fact, they repeat in a pattern.</p>
<p>What is weird here is that everything you see is actually stretched out through time too: you, me, that pencil, this cup of coffee; and we are always only seeing one thin &quot;time slice&quot; of them in any given moment. The difference is that these other objects seem to either have the same structure through time, or they only change in one direction - the coffee gradually gets cold, it doesn't get cold for a little while and then start heating back up again. </p>
<p>In nature when we do see some kind of material that has a repeating pattern to its structure, we call that a crystal - like a sugar crystal or a diamond. Since this &quot;time repeating&quot; material has a repeating pattern to what it is made out of, and it is repeating across time, we are calling it a &quot;time crystal.&quot;</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!!! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm far from an expert on this, but this is what I understood when I read about them.</p>
<p>A regular crystal is a physical structure that does not change through time.  A time crystal is a structure that does change through time, but does so predictably, on a cycle.  If you have one that is on a 3 second loop, then at every time the cycle hits 1 second the crystal looks exactly the same as every other time it hits one second.  The same for 2 seconds and 3 seconds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While I donâ€™t have expert level depth, from the top level this is what I can provide:</p>
<p>Crystals are physical structures that have patterns repeating over space, i.e. diamond is a set, repeating, structure of carbon atoms. </p>
<p>Time Crystals have patterns that repeat over time, on a loop. This means that instead of having the same pattern at two points in space, it will have the same pattern at two moments in time. This means for a time crystal, at the start of its loop it will always have the same structure, and two seconds after the start of one loop it will have an identical structure to two seconds after the start of any other loop by that same crystal.</p>
<p>As far as what it means for science, I honestly have no idea and hope someone can respond to this to shed more light on that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok so it's not a crystal if you look at it now, or 5 minutes from now, or 20 minutes from now, but when you look at all of those times together, you see there is a crystalline structure.</p>
<p>Imagine a gas that moved in a repeating pattern. At any given moment it just looks like gas, but over time you realize there's an actual structure it's moving in, in recognizable shapes, that repeat in a uniform pattern over time.</p>
<p>Edit for all those wanting to make sure this is accurate, here's a direct quote from the wiki to confirm:</p>
<p>&quot;A time crystal or space-time crystal is a structure that repeats in time, as well as in space. Normal three-dimensional crystals have a repeating pattern in space, but remain unchanged as time passes. Time crystals repeat themselves in time as well, leading the crystal to change from moment to moment.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
