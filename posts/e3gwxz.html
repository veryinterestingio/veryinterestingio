		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you point at a duck and pull the trigger, the computer in the NES blacks out the screen and the Zapper diode begins reception. Then, the computer flashes a solid white block around the targets you’re supposed to be shooting at. The photodiode in the Zapper detects the change in light intensity and tells the computer that it’s pointed at a lit target block — in others words, you should get a point because you hit a target. In the event of multiple targets, a white block is drawn around each potential target one at a time. The diode’s reception of light combined with the sequence of the drawing of the targets lets the computer know that you hit a target and which one it was. Of course, when you’re playing the game, you don’t notice the blackout and the targets flashing because it all happens in a fraction of a second.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just want to say, oh dear the wording of that title is a little unfortunate.</p>
<p>Anyway, the way it worked is neat. The screen blacks out, and the hitboxes for the ducks turn white. If the diode inside detects the change from dark to light, it registers a shot and gives you points.</p>
<p>And if there's multiple targets, it goes one at a time and tries to find the delay.</p>
<p>Because of the way it works, it actually can't be used on an LCD screen, only CRT.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The old NES light gun that was used with Duck Hunt, simply had a light sensor on it. The game would briefly flash the target on the screen in bright white when you pressed the trigger. If the light gun registered a bright light in the direction it was pointed the game counted that as a hit.</p>
<p>Other than timing there was no way for the game to know if you perhaps pointed the gun at a different source of light to fake a hit.</p>
<p>Other types of gun would for example be based on the timing of the electron beam sweeping across your crt display. Those devices won't work with modern displays.</p>
<p>Some later ones had infra-red emitters placed around the screen and the gun measuring how far below and to the side of the emitters it was pointed. This required calibration and might not be as accurate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
