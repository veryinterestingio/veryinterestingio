I'll try to reply to as many of your solutions as possible. I actually want to lock this discussion, so that more people don't reply. I already got the answer - the roaches don't get immunity to the spray, because they don't propagate as fast as bacteria and don't produce genetically identical offspring. I've also now learned that I should use boric acid powder instead of bug spray, because it clings to the body of the roaches, then they carry it to the nests, where the babies also eat it and die. I want to close the discussion, but I only see the option to hide the post. I don't want to do that because it'd be nice for people with the same questions as me to be able to find this thread. Does anyone know how to do that?</p>
<p>Edit 2: I got the bug spray and haven't been using it for a few hours now. I found 4 of their nests by following them and heavily sprayed the locations. They all came rushing out, then just flipped on their backside, while having some type of seizure. From what I observed, they take a long time to die from this. Something like 30 minutes. My mum says they simply passed out and will regain consciousness in a few minutes. Can they actually survive?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>She has a solid, basic understanding of evolutionary biology.  That is, it may be the case that some of the survivors are more resistant to the spray, and the next generation from them will also have the same higher resistance.  However, there is no reason to suspect the offspring will be MORE resistant, except by a very small, random chance of genetic mutation.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>When you are dealing with millions of bacteria that reproduce at rates of up to every 20 minutes, these mutations can become statistically significant and you end up with highly-resistant strains. This takes thousands of generations of organisms with enormous numbers.  It will not happen with roaches in your house.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If an individual roach builds up a tolerance over many small doses, that may be a tough roach, but its increased tolerance will not pass on to its progeny.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Spray 'em.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So sprays are ineffective because they don't target the actual nest, you're just killing the roaches you can see and now the ones in the walls you can't reach. Get a baiting gel (Advion is great), the roaches eat it, crawl to their nest, die later, then get cannibalized by their friends. Their friends then die. Then they get eaten. Then a third generation will eat it and die. The young ones that don't venture from the nest will eat it and die too which is what you want. It's what professional exterminators do.<br />
In general with sprays, while technically over a very long period of time you could produce resistant roaches - the main issue is it's just not effective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like she gets survival of the fittest and is rightfully concerned about antibiotic resistance in pathogenic microbes.</p>
<p>Try talking to her about the adaptability of microbes compared to multicellular organisms.
One reason that antibiotic resistance is an issue is that microbes can pick up and incorporate free DNA and other biological molecules in their environment easily by nature of being single-celled. They can literally trade DNA with each other as a strategy to keep up generic diversity. If one of them mutates, it can give its friends that mutation, plus all of its offspring will absolutely have the mutation, being clones of the parent.</p>
<p>Roaches, meanwhile, can’t trade DNA without having roach sex AKA the worst kind of sex. If an adult has a mutation and the mutation doesn’t impact its reproductive system, its offspring probably won’t carry the mutation (only saying probably so no one will be like bUt WHaT aBoUt rOaCH ePIgeNeTiCs).</p>
<p>Then there’s the fact that if something kills 99.999% of a colony, and if you have 1,000,000 bacteria, you will still have 10 survivors. Those ten survivors should be the best at resisting whatever method you used, and they can give each other their resistance related genes. Meanwhile, if you have 100 roaches in your house and you spray all of them with something that kills 99.999%, 0.001 roaches will survive. Statistically none of them will make it, and you need two survivors to make more roaches. This is exacerbated by the fact that resistant genes won’t be transferred horizontally prior to the extermination meaning survival will be even less frequent compared to a population of bacteria of the same size.</p>
<p>Then there’s the fact that most bacteria are harmless, and all roaches deserve to die. Spray the hell out of your roaches so you can peacefully have nightmares about antibiotic resistance. I know I will :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>Use roach bait so they bring it back to the nest and kill from within</li>
<li>Use caulk to seal up every single nook and cranny where they could potentially get in</li>
<li>Boric acid after you've sealed all you can. Much better for you. But don't do this if you have pets!</li>
<li>All food needs to be put in the fridge or airtight container. You need to take out the garbage after every meal. Don't encourage them to stay and multiply by feeding them!</li>
<li>Just spraying your house indiscriminately with roach poison causes them to move from one room to another and isn't as effective as bait.</li>
