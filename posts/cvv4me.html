<p>I just read this article and I’m trying to figure out why this doesn’t constitute Insider Trading. To me, they are using information about their companies with regards to how everything going on economically is affecting their companies and so are selling before everything (potentially) tanks. Am I wrong/misunderstanding something?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Insider trading means that someone buys/sells stock in their own company because of knowledge that isn't publicly available. For example, if a boardgames maker were about to acquire a software company, and neither company had announced this publicly, then for someone from boardgame co to invest in softwareco before they announced the merger would be insider trading.</p>
<p>If these investors are making guesses about the economy is about to do, them That's fine. If they were operating on secret knowledge specific to the companies being bought/sold, that would be insider trading.</p>
<p>Merely anticipating a crash and selling stocks first... Is working how the market intended</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>“Insider trading” means trading while in possession of material nonpublic information about the issuer that the seller had access to as an insider. </p>
<p>When there is something material and nonpublic going on at a company, executives will be instructed not to transact in company stock until the material thing has been disclosed to the public and the markets have had a chance to react. </p>
<p>Also, insiders often make pre-programmed periodic sales through an independent agent to avoid the appearance of insider trading. </p>
<p>The sales could reflect an overall pessimistic view of the economy as a whole or a specific industry, not material nonpublic information regarding the issuer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am on the “restricted” trading list for my employer. That means that, outside of a certain time period (typically just after quarterly earnings are release), and without prior approval, I cannot sell my stock. If I trade company stock outside of those conditions, I’m top of the list for “insider trading”. </p>
<p>I also have a decent amount of company stock. Why? Because it has become a very common form of compensation. Companies (like mine) try to make themselves more attractive than the competition by offering things like options and restricted stock units (RSUs). </p>
<p>It is not uncommon for people in a similar situation (including others in my company) to sell that stock once it vests. I have hung onto mine so far, but I totally get the idea of selling as the RSUs vest so that you can diversify.  And when those people sell, it is published publicly, so these kind of stats are easy to obtain. </p>
<p>This trend isn’t stock holders saying “I think things are looking bad so I’m going to bail”.  It’s simply adjustment to new compensation methods.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, let me give you a hypothetical scenario based off of publicly known economic conditions.</p>
<p>Pork belly prices have been dropping all morning, which means that everybody's waiting for it to hit rock bottom so they can buy cheap and go long. Which means that the people who own the pork belly contracts are goin' bat-shit. They're saying, &quot;Hey, we're losing all our goddamn money, and Christmas is just around the corner, and I ain't gonna have no money to buy my son the G.I. Joe with the kung-fu grip, right? And my wife won't f... my wife won't make love to me 'cuz I ain't got no money, right?&quot; So they're panicking right now, they're screaming &quot;SELL! SELL!&quot; to get out before the price keeps dropping. They're panicking out there right now! I can feel it! They out there!</p>
<p>That's knowing the market, insider trading requires &quot;insider&quot; knowledge like the CEO of a pork belly company being told by their factory supervisor &quot;Hey, all of our pork has pig AIDs so we can't sell this.&quot; and then they sell their stocks an hour before the public announcement that all the pork has AIDs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
