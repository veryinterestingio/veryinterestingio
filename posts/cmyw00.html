		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally not. </p>
<p>You might be drawing an analogy to 'if i sit in the dark for a while, a bright light is really bright - imagine if i lived in the dark!', but it isn't really like that.</p>
<p>Most of the visible spectrum doesn't penetrate too far, with only the blue end of the visible spectrum penetrating to the depths. As a result many animals that far down are insensitive to light, and those that are tend to be sensitive to only blue light - It's why so many deep sea creatures appear to be red or pink when we film them with white light (since red light doesn't penetrate that far down, a red coloured object is functionally black).</p>
<p>The only minor impact i can think of is in regards to a handful of species that have developed the ability to broadcast and sense red light. They are predators, and essentially have red 'headlights' under their eyes that cause the red/pink animals to light up like a christmas tree. Broadcasting white light down there would illuminate the subject to these predators...but it's a pretty niche thing, and not something to be concerned about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have posted that generally animals at that depth would not be affected due to not having the ability to detect the light. There is one case where this was not the case and the animals were blinded. Shrimp that were found two kilometers below sea level clustering around hydrothermal vents had pinkish light detecting layer when researchers first examined them.  Years later the shrimp at a heavily visited site the light detecting patches had gone chalky white. The researchers noted that even though the shrimp had gone blind, it didn't not seem to affect their ability to survive, but it is a cautionary tale that we might be causing harm to deep sea life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If a creature is still able to perceive light it might scuttle away. But many are blind. A bit like turning the light on in the basement. Some of the creatures won't like it and hide, but they're not harmed, and the light won't be on for long anyways.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am in no way equipped to answer this question myself, but if you’re interested in this type of thing, the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute has an awesome Instagram feed where they share clips from their research and frequently answer questions. This seems like a good question to post there, if it’s not already addressed in their web site. (I know Reddit loves to hate on Instagram, but mbari_news is a fun follow. Without them I would not know that vampire squid exist, and my life is richer for knowing.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
