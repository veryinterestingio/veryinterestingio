		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Japan had a baby boom like the USA after WWII, but it was much more pronounced. The growth was larger, and it was less muddled by immigration like in the US, and the population was more universally impacted. As a result, Japan has a lot of people the same age. </p>
<p>In Tokyo in 1968, the median age was something like 22. Can you image living in a city where the majority of people are in their early 20’s? Madness. The economic impact of a huge majority of the population being in their prime earning years at the same time boosted their economy in the late 20th century. </p>
<p>But now they’re all old, so a huge percentage of their labor force is retiring, and expecting to live several decades afterwards. The economic output of the country is going to fall, while the demands on the economy to support the retiring workers is rising. Small towns in the country are especially impacted, as they don’t have enough local labor to run their commerce and small businesses. </p>
<p>It’s a real pickle.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Japan isn't overpopulated, the problem is how it's populated. Japan does have some dense overpopulated cities, however rural Japan has the opposite problem with lots of abandoned houses, towns, etc. Over 13.5% homes in Japan are unoccupied.</p>
<p>Declining birth rates means it's harder to look over the aging population, harder to support existing infrastructure without raising taxes, and less people to fill existing industry roles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eli5: there are less workers that are paying for more retirees. The workers have to pay more because of that. The workers have less money as a result. </p>
<p>Eli18: The dollars you put into your national pension are not the exact same dollars that you use later in life.</p>
<p>The current generation of work force's contributions to their national pension pay out the weekly stipend the current group of seniors collects.</p>
<p>This system works because in history, the age group in the workforce has typically been larger than the age group that's retired (positive population growth and death of old age cause this).</p>
<p>In an example, 1,000,000 workers are subsidizing the retirement of 100,000 seniors. Little of the worker's salaries needs to be contributed for those seniors to enjoy a good standard of living.</p>
<p>In Japan's case, they're experiencing negative population growth and a longer lifespan. Therefore fewer workers have to cover the expenses of a more seniors. 100,000 workers need to pay for 1,000,000 senior's lifestyle.</p>
<p>Everyone suffers. The seniors get less money per person, and the Japanese government will try to enact policy that takes more from the average Japanese worker to address this shortage.</p>
<p>This takes away from the current worker's ability to save for retirement or enjoy their disposable income.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Japan is overpopulated by seniors.  A decreasing birth rate means that in 20-30 years you'll have less workforce and a lot of seniors to support on welfare/retirement programs.</p>
<p>The US's social security isn't a savings program.   The current workforce is directly paying out to current seniors.  If the balance of workforce to seniors swings to seniors then you have less income from workforce to distribute to large amount of seniors</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
