		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a somewhat remnant of their ancient ancestors. Fish evolved from animals that slithered on the sea floor so an undulating movement helped them move, the fishes side to side moving tail is suited to it. </p>
<p>Marine mammals evolved from land mammals whos legs were underneath them and had an unstable gait to allow rapid direction changes.  To extend their stride they flexed their spines up and down, so when they evolved to be fully aquatic the horizontail tail shape came with it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A vertical tail or fin is more suitable for horizontal propulsion, and vice versa. Mammals need to climb up and down for air so horizontal tail is more optimal. Marine animals' locomotion is adapted to their needs and habitat e.g. any direction movement by squid, octopus, jellyfish using jet propulsion.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>horizontal spine flexing is the original way all animals with spines moved. that's causes a wriggle that allows fish to swim through water. then some fish went to land and  developed limbs and an upright stance. Lizards, newts and salamanders still do the wriggle, but mammals run differently because their legs are directly unter the body. Their bodies don't drag on the surface, their gait and limbs can be much larger and they can support more body weight that way. And the spine developed to flex vertically because that assists running as as extra joint that can contrac and extend, increasing opower and gait length. and when they went back into the water they kept it that way because it worked just fine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
