		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially, people hospitalized for COVID-19 are not being treated for COVID-19, they are being treated for its symptoms, which are what kills the most people.</p>
<p>Namely, respiratory difficulties caused by the virus can kill, but can also be alleviated with assisted respiration equipment.</p>
<p>If done right and without too many complications, these band-aids on the lethal symptoms can keep the person alive long enough for their body to develop effective antibodies and, eventually, beat the virus down and become immune through their own immune system.</p>
<p>For this, a functional immune system is still required. If the immune system is too slow, or too weak, it's possible the body might never be able to defeat the virus, or may end up having to deploy its biggest guns because there's too much of the virus everywhere in the body, at which point the immune system can simply kill the person. This is why older victims and those with immune system preconditions are more at risk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I admit people or am discussing admission to ICU, one of the most tricky things to get across is what exactly ICU is for.</p>
<p>Contrary to what most think, we do not &quot;fix&quot; people on ICU. We don't &quot;get people better&quot;. What we do is provide support to failing organs, giving the body enough time to rally and sort itself out.</p>
<p>Yes, we provide supportive treatment. Yes, we would give you antibiotics for a severe bacterial infection etc, but the entire purpose of all of that is to buy time for the body to sort itself out. This is why there are admission criteria to intensive care; if you are generally weak, frail and/or have severe comorbidity, intensive care will not &quot;make you better&quot;.</p>
<p>Coronavirus is generally a self limiting viral infection that has the nasty side effect of causing respiratory failure (as well as occasional viral myocarditis, renal failure etc) in small numbers of cases. We can't fix that in intensive care, but what we can do, is put you on a ventilator so your body doesn't have to worry about your failing lungs so much. This gives more time for your body to fight off the infection the old fashioned way.</p>
<p>Despite all we do, you still may die.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In essence you treat with supportive care,</p>
<p>We help manage temps w tylenol.</p>
<p>If the person has worsening respiratory function then we put them on the ventilator if supplemental oxygen wasn't enough. </p>
<p>If they worsen on the vent we manage it from there, blood pressure drops and giving you iv fluids isn't enough, then we put a central line and give you vasopressors , such as levophed (norepinephrine).</p>
<p>Kidneys shut down, no problem, dialysis on crrt (continuous renal replacement therapy).</p>
<p>It's all a matter of supportive care, and how well a person recovers from there.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a bit confusing in the way it can be worded when they say &quot;no treatment.&quot;There's no treatment for the virus itself. But there are treatments for the symptoms. Think of it like this: There's no real treatment for the common cold either. If you have a stuffy nose, you take a decongestant. It treats your congestion, but does nothing to the cold virus itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially, one treats each symptom until the virus burns itself out.  The fever/high temperature of the body is deadly to viruses. The problem is that we do not have antivirals the same way be have antibacterial medications.  </p>
<p>That’s one reason the ventilators are so important.  While the body is hard at work fighting the virus, the lungs have lost the capacity to keep the patient oxygenated.  The virus attaches to small areas in the lung, the lungs lose the ability to expand and contract and the areas where the O2/CO2 exchange take place are weakened.  The ventilators “breath” for the patient while they attempt to burn off the virus and recover.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have heard of people being put in a medically induced coma so they can “cure” themselves; this is a similar idea.  There is not cure, but a healthy body can fight the virus, even if their breathing is compromised by using a ventilator.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
