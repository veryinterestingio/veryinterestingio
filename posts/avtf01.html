		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anytime you are dealing with someone earning a “commission” there is usually a little leeway on price. I worked for a pre owned dealership for a few months and we always knew the number we couldn’t drop below. The negotiations were me trying to save as much of my commission as possible without losing the sale. It’s a cut throat industry which is why car salesman are so clingy when you walk into the lot. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that's true. Sure in consumer stores that applies, but not everywhere. Home buying comes to mind. Also any sort of corporate transaction (not the consumer level of course) is bargained as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Three reasons:</p>
<p>1) Cost of bargaining. This is a cost in time, labour, and space. The item needs to be worth enough for the bargaining process to be worth it. Getting 10% of a £1 purchase is not worth it to the consumer and certainly not worth the margin hit to the </p>
<p>2) Margin. If the margin is really small, there is not much bargaining that can happen, because selling at a loss is not a winning strategy. (Whether there is much margin is heavily linked in to 3.)</p>
<p>3) Non-homogeneous product. A PS4 is a homogeneous product (mostly). Where you buy it matters very little, every PS4 is the same. Hence competition will drive down the prices to the margin people are willing to sell for. The competition is pretty much entirely on price. With a car, there's a lot more factors - you cannot generally just walk away and buy the same car somewhere else. Hence there can be a bigger range of prices you might accept for the car.</p>
<p>Cars hit the confluence of all 3, as do houses (the other main thing consumers haggle for).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not just automobiles. People also haggle on houses and other expensive items. The reason is that in those cases haggling is actually worth the effort. If I'm buying a loaf of bread at the grocery store it's just not worth the time it would take to haggle a few cents off, but when buying a home or a car a bit of persuasion could potentially save you thousands of dollars, so it's worth it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a competitive market that doesn't make the bulk of it's money off of the actual product. If you are shopping for something with lots of add on and up-sale options there is a high chance that you can haggle the price of the product.</p>
<p>If you go into any specialty store, feel free to haggle if you think the price is too high. Grocery stores and many Big Box stores have thin total profit margins because they know that you will just go to the place with the lowest advertised price. If you think you will save $.05 on every product at Store-Mart you won't bother going to Shopget at all.   </p>
<p>Comparing that to auto sales, guitar sales, or jewelry (really anything that you are going to actually shop around for) and you have a lower product turn over at a higher price. If they are only going to sell a few a day you better believe they have a high mark-up and grueling quotas for their salespeople. This is why you can haggle. There is more for them to gain and less for them to lose by making the sale today instead of hoping for one tomorrow. This is why shopping for these things at the end of the month during the slow season is best.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
