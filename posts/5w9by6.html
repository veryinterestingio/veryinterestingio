		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a lot easier to think when body is in relaxed state and the more upward blood flow goes to brain. Resting chin on head reduces supporting neck muscles using up the blood flowing upwards, hence more blood for brain; additionally by sitting down more blood is available for upper body as the lower body is not as active. So generally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thinker" target="_blank">the thinking man</a> pose is optimal for active brain.</p>
<p>We subconsciously do this when thinking deeply, and has become an evolutionary trait. There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirshasana#Contraindications_and_cautions" target="_blank">other ways</a> to increase blood flow to brain, but that benefit maybe countered by discomfort.</p>
<p>Edit: Minor word correction as I was not resting my chin on hand
Update: Speaking from experience, not research based</p>
<p>Update2: Queries on source? Peer reviewed research will be hard to come by given the topic (medically mundane/commercially not valuable)..but it is evident from experience that thinking capacity is diminished after heavy food or we feel light headed when getting up suddenly–both corresponding to redirection of blood supply while heart rate has not caught up. Once the heart rate has caught-up, there's more overall circulation, so mild activity works. Heavy activity, however, counters the benefit of circulation with lower blood oxygen level. Easy way for focused thinking—sit down after drinking ginkgo tea followed by a brisk walk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if it's related, but the reason people rub their neck when they are really anxious is that the Vagus nerve runs right through there. Stimulating your Vagus nerve gives a pretty large response of the Parasympathetic nervous system which calms you (slows heart rate, slows respiratory rate, drops blood pressure, etc...). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_activity" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_activity</a></p>
<p>Basicially if you have 2 conflicting behaviours (so thinking about which of the 2 pizzas you are about to order) it can lead you to express a third one that is unrelated to them(Scratching head).</p>
<p>This can be seen in a lot of other animals.</p>
<p>Buuut there may be other reasons, like having physical stimulation increase the stimulation of your brain whilst thinking about an answer.</p>
<p>Maybe someone else here has a cited resource on chin scratching :D</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In &quot;Seeing Through Clothes,&quot; a book by Anne Hollander, she talks about generations and their learned gestures. The touching of the chin is sort of a gestural convention that has been with us for a while. I can't say if there's a sort of a predisposition for the pose, but there's definitely a learned component. That's why it's so amusing to look at little kids because they learn these gestures so quickly, like the indignant downward tilting of the head and folding of the arms to show when they're upset. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
