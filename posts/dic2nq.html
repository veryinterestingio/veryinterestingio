		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not an answer... But you can try some experimentation / documentation to try and find out what affects you personally. Keep a detailed journal of several factors and then judge how your focus levels are in relation to them. Items you may track: Sleep amount and quality, stress levels, outside stimulus (light, sound, environmental changes), work-load (energy consumption), food intake, including types and quality of food (things like how processed the food was, amount and types of sugar, proteins, fats), physical environment (home, work, bus, plane, etc), etc, etc, etc. For the subjective items, try to be consistent in how you rank them. Come up with a scale (1-10) and write down how you will define them so you don't drift or change over time. Something like: Stress level (1-10) 1 being perfectly calm, 5 being alert but not agitated, 10 being elevated heart rate, sweating, nervousness).</p>
<p>Compile all of this data in tabular form (spreadsheet for example) where you can plot the data and try to find patterns. Are you exceptionally focused after a good night's sleep and quality food intake? Do you struggle when you have to travel alot or encounter outside stress? Patterns like these.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>many books, many articles, many videos, many posts about getting in the ZONE or ZEN state</p>
<p>People talk about ADD, Procrastination, having a fire lit up under your ass etc...</p>
<p>How do you get yourself into the ZONE/ZEN state? <shrug></p>
<p>It is a magical place and if you figure it out that is great but I am not sure everything can be controlled/replicated, we are not machines.</p>
<p>Me personally I have moments of greatness, I find them most often when under pressure or during discussion of complex things with multiple people</p>
<p>I like to think it is my cycle.... I have times of contemplation/in-action and times of action</p>
<p>Do I have ADD? maybe, do I procrastinate? Yes</p>
<p>I'm 40 now and I am more often within 'in-action' time than 'action' time regardless of the deadline. I find I do my best work 'in the moment' and struggle and beat myself up when I am not in that moment.</p>
<p>'The work/action' phase is where you SEE all the progress/change/impact but without that 'in-action/contemplation' phase... I would think the 'action' phase would be less impactful</p>
<p>I dont think I want to find myself always in that 'action' phase because I feel everything is cyclical and you need those highs and lows but the more important thing is to stay on a trajectory</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't agree with the ADD nonsense. I think you just had a moment of motivation and energy to focus and do those things. It happened to me last weekend when I decided to finally clean the crap out of my closet which has been a mess since I moved in 4 months ago. I am not even remotely close to having ADD. Never have. </p>
<p>Sometimes you're just in the mood to do shit you didn't wanna do before. Everything isn't an issue or a disorder like others are making it seem. For me I realize when I get a lot accomplished throughout the day and fuel myself properly with good foods, I'm in a GREAT mood. Especially if I'm not sore or tired from training/lifting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One way to figure out how to harness it is to know where it is coming from. If I may ask you -- How long does it last for? Is in in periods of 4 days or more, feeling like that pretty consistently and other times not really at all? Or is it smaller bursts, like half a day or a few hours? When it happens do you feel very excitable, having racing thoughts like you cant keep up with them,have really high or elevated mood?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hormones. They effect men just as much as women and have a huge effect on focus and ambition levels. Most males do not realize they have a hormone cycle, just like women. The cycle and levels can get out of balance and cause binary mood changes from day to day. One day you will be lethargic and disinterested and the next you’ll be jumping out of bed ready to take on the world. Docs can check your testosterone levels, but many docs are hesitant to offer men hormone therapy, due to the current acceptability of demonizing masculinity. But if your hormone levels are off and it’s effecting your mood, it’s worth seeking a doctor willing to help.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
