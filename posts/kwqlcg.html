		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Low friction, very sharp: sschhhhwip ooh baby</p>
<p>High friction, blunt: sshcklaclacklackack ah fuck</p>
<p>Sharp scissors cut with very little force, so there isn't enough energy built up in the pressure of the blade against the paper to rip very far. This keeps the tear immediately next to the blade, so the blade continues to cut with very little force.</p>
<p>With a blunt blade, there isn't enough force to rip the paper against the blade until the tension is much higher, then once the paper begins to tear it can tear further and probably not in a straight line ahead of the blade. So then the blade is pushing against un-torn edge instead of the cleft of the cut and the problem starts again.</p>
<p>You can increase the chances of the sschhhhwip by sharpening the scissors and by slowly closing the scissors as you push, keeping the cut in front of the blades and applying both of them to reduce the required force to cut the paper.</p>
<p>If you push hard, you're more likely to rip the paper.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you push scissors foward you're doing two things to the paper at the same time...you're putting the paper in compression due to the push (ahead of the blades), tension behind the blades, and you're putting the paper in shear due to the &quot;wedging&quot; of the offset blades. As you push harder, both forces increase.</p>
<p>Usually, the compression gets high enough to buckle (wrinkle) the paper or the tension gets high enough to tear before shear gets high enough to cut. However, if the scissors are fairly closed and the paper is fairly stiff and the blades are fairly sharp, you can get over the shear force to cut before the paper buckles...now you're in &quot;slide mode&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scissors create cutting force by bringing together two sharp edges down and forward at the same time to basically squeeze apart molecules at a single, retreating point; this works because perpendicular forces to not affect each other (Which is why if you drop a ball from a car, it will still keep going at the same speed of the car until the air pushes back on it, while still going down under the influence of gravity).</p>
<p>So when scissors enter &quot;slide mode&quot; sometimes, it's because the scissors themselves are taut enough at the point where their blades are held together (often assisted by your fingers) to create enough downward force on their own, so all the user needs to do is provide the forward force. It's usually quite a delicate balance as any &quot;nick&quot; on the scissor blades could stop it, or any gap between the two blades could give enough wiggle room to cancel out the downward force.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
