		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, your brain pays more attention to negative experiences like sadness (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias</a>). This effect becomes more dramatic if you’re genetically predisposed to depression. As a second reason, if you’re predisposed to depression, your brain generally responds less strongly to positive emotions than to negative emotions (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3181884/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3181884/</a>). </p>
<p>Sadness is perfectly okay to feel, but if you ever begin to lose the ability to feel pleasure or start becoming empty or numb, definitely try to get help. All of these changes in the ways that our brain processes emotion in depression can be reversed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've known people in my life that seem to be happy no matter what happens. Almost like their default state is happiness. </p>
<p>So that being said you cannot really state that being sad is easier like it's a fact. </p>
<p>I think this depends on several factors such as your mental/physical health. Also depends on the kind of habits you have. </p>
<p>I think for most people it is easier to maintain a state somewhere in the middle. With both a series of highs, lows, and middles. </p>
<p>That being said if you feel as though you cannot get out of feeling a state of sadness all of the time I would reccomend reaching out to a therapist to find the root of these feelings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sustaining a depressed mood is not easier than sustaining a happy one, for the general population.  </p>
<p>Emotions are waves, temporary sensations, and the people you likely consider &quot;Happy&quot; are not feeling happy all the time.  </p>
<p>Much like, even though you consider yourself depressed, you're not sad all of the time.  </p>
<p>If you find that you fixate on bad feelings and are wallowing in depressive emotion, you should seek treatment.  </p>
<p>But the best thing I got out of three years of weekly therapy sessions was the above realization --- Happiness is a temporary sensation, not a state of being.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because apathy is easy. To sit and do nothing is easy. </p>
<p>Bit to be happy usually means you are actively doing things, including things you enjoy, so the effort involved to get up and find a book or play an instrument or do some art or learn a new skill or even just have a shower is way way more then just sitting on your couch and bed while your brown goes &quot;meh&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
