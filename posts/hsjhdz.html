		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is because your body goes through a series of transitions as you start falling asleep. Muscles relax to the point where you should be unable to move them at one point, breathing slows, body temperature decreases and your brain goes through some transitions as well. Changes are, amongst others, how we process memory and thoughts.</p>
<p>For you to remember the act of falling asleep, you would need to tell your brain to help you retain full consciousness til the very last second, only then would you be able to perceive the change of consciousness itself, but since it is a process, your ability to remember you falling asleep to the second is, unfortunately impossible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because there isn't one.</p>
<p>Sleep isn't a binary process, rather there are different levels. You ever get woken up just as you were starting to fall asleep, and realise you kind of were already asleep? That's because you were just in a very light form of sleep where it's hard to distinguish between being asleep and being awake. </p>
<p>It's kind of like how you can't tell an exact moment between not feeling hungry, and feeling hungry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stage 1 is pretty light, during one study people were &quot;woken up&quot; when people's brains started to show that patterns for stage 1 and the participants would say they hadn't been asleep!!! If someone had insomnia this happened more often. So good news for people with insomnia you might actually be asleep when you think you are awake.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It was midday and all sound got muffled and farther away. All my physical feelings fell further away and it scared me awake.
