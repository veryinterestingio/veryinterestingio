		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The explanation I have heard is that it is a reflex because the body thinks it's falling when the muscles relax. For a lot of people, including myself, it is accompanied by a feeling of falling. Our ancestors lived in trees so it is possible it is a reflex left over from our primate ancestors. However, no one really knows the answer as of yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't cite my source on this one because it has been SOOO LOOONNNGGG. And maybe the working knowledge has changed since then.. But, here's what I remember from my time working in a neuroscience lab</p>
<p>It's not your body &quot;checking&quot; on you. Your motor nerves have an impulse threshold, meaning a certain level of neurotransmitters makes the nerve fire and that moves your muscle. As your nerves and neurotransmitters are changing levels and thresholds in preparation for sleep, sometimes your current level builds up past the threshold, and you jerk. </p>
<p>ELI5: You know that big bucket at the water park that tips over once it is full enough? Picture that bucket as your nerve, and the water as your neurotransmitters. The tipping part is firing the muscle. </p>
<p>Now put a hole in the bottom of the bucket, so that mostly you are at a steady state and not tipping unless you crank up the flow of the water. </p>
<p>Well, as you go to sleep, the size of the bucket changes, and the flow rate in and out of the bucket are being adjusted, and sometimes the bucket tips when you didn't mean for it to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>More speculation from someone who has had sleep paralysis: I've read that it's your brain sending out a signal to &quot;test&quot; if you're asleep or not. If you're asleep then your muscles won't contract; if you're awake then your muscles will twitch. </p>
<p>Sidenote: if you focus, you can feel that twitch coming and forcefully relax your muscles so they won't twitch even when you're awake and your brain sends the sleep signal. This was <em>meant</em> to help lucid dreaming, but instead gave me horrific nightmares and sleep paralysis. Would not recommend.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly it's called a hypnogogic jerk. Your body thinks it's dying so it sends a jolt of electrolytes through your system to make sure everything still works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your heartbeat slowed down way too much, as well as other bodily functions so your body (did not think it was dying) was making sure you weren’t hurt and sent out an electric shock to EVERYTHING to speed a few things up and contract a few muscles. There are other reactions to our body thinking it’s dying or actually dying and this isn’t one of them. Some things that might cause it that we’ve observed is caffeine, anxiety or stress, and other causes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
