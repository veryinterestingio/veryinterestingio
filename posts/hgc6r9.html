		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is there a percent that will <em>never ever</em> be water again? No. There are very few absolute rules about what will never ever happen. But to answer your question from a somewhat less absolute point of view, yes some water is not excreted but is incorporated into various biological molecules. When you break down protein, for example, you break it down into smaller molecules called amino acids. In the protein the amino acids are bonded together with peptide bonds, where the last atom of one amino acid (C) is bonded to the first atom of the next (N). So it goes aminoacid-C-N-aminoacid. To break down the protein, water is used to split that C-N bond, and it becomes aminoacid-C-OH     +     H-N-aminoacid. So you can see that the water molecule (H2O or H-O-H) was split into an -OH and an H-, so basically that water molecule has been incorporated into two now separate amino acids. </p>
<p>In this way, water is not excreted but is rather incorporated into other molecules.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part 1:</p>
<p>When plants get energy from the Sun they take carbon out of carbondioxide (CO2) to make plant matter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CO2+(Sunlight Energy)--&gt;C + O2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When animals get energy from eating plants they add carbon to oxygen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C + O2 --&gt; CO2 + (Sunlight Energy)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A useful way of thinking of this is the C and O2 slamming together makes a loud bang (i.e. energy).  These are super simplified concepts though.  The actual mechanisms require tons of intermediary steps that include other elements and molecules and cellular processes etc.</p>
<hr />
<p>Part 2:</p>
<p>Water is important to lubricate things in your body and provide a medium for things to flow around.  When you drink water a lot of it is used for this purpose and is expelled as urine, sweat, and H2O gas vapour in your breath.</p>
<hr />
<p>Part 3:</p>
<p>Let's take a closer look at cellular respiration.  That is, the process cells in animals use to combine C and O2 to create a loud bang (energy).</p>
<p>Plants aren't actually storing elemental carbon (plain old C).  They usual store it as a hydro carbon (HnCnOn).  The one you are most likely to be familiar with is glucose (C6H12O6).</p>
<p>If we look at the process of taking C+O2--&gt;CO2 and realize that the 'C' is actually stored as C6H12O6 then we'd see that other H and O make an appearance.  Consider the combustion of methanol...</p>
<p>CH3OH + O2 --&gt; CO2 + 2 H2O</p>
<p>... burning stuff (like wood, alcohol, etc.) actually creates water.</p>
<hr />
<p>Part 4:</p>
<p>So if you breath oxygen and eat hydrocarbons and then burn the hydrocarbon+oxygen to create energy you also create extra water.  The question though is about the water you drink.  Is any of it converted into something else or does it only act as a lubricate / medium?  The answer is fuck yes it is converted into other shit.  The biological steps involved to take C + O2 and create CO2 + energy are complex.  The most common pathway is called the citric acid cycle.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid_cycle" target="_blank">article on wikipedia</a> and you'll see there are many stages that require water as an input and break it down into all sorts of other stuff.</p>
<hr />
<p>So of the water you drink some will be used as a lubricant/medium, and other parts will be used in chemical reactions where the elements are no longer stored as water.  It's difficult to answer if they will never be liquid water again when you consider the breakdown of your dead body and geological timescales and processes after that, but in the short term some water you drink will have elements that don't turn to water again any time soon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what happens to your body. Some of the water in your body is used to create other compounds if those compounds end up becoming something like oil or coal they may never burn and recombine with oxygen and become water. If you are cremated pretty much all of the hydrogen in your body, not just from water but also from foods, becomes water vapor when burned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of the water you take in is used in your body's chemistry. The hydrogen and oxygen that make up the water is split and joined with other elements to make other chemicals. It is likely that, some time later, those oxygen and hydrogen elements will end up joined with other hydrogen and oxygen to become water again, but it won't be the same elements.</p>
<p>But here's something that you might not realise - you excrete more water than you take in. The sugars you consume contain oxygen and hydrogen. When you breathe in, you take in oxygen. When you burn the sugar, you combine that oxygen and hydrogen to create more water. This supplies about 10% f the water that you excrete in various ways.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We also breathe out a fair amount of water. That’s why you can see your breath when it’s cold out. That water will probably eventually turn back into liquid water when it rains, but that’s beside the point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
