		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They call this condition &quot;honeybound&quot;</p>
<p>Queens need open cells to lay eggs...
If a colony becomes too cramped in their hive they will create a new set of queens and all the oldest bees and the old queen fly away to start a new hive in some other new space.. the young bees remain behind taking care of the new queens and new baby bees... the new queens have fatal duels until only one remains... typically if the first queen to emerge is healthy she will be allowed to go kill the other queens  before they escape their cocoons... if the best queen is slow to emerge workers will protect that area from a lesser but quicker to emerge queen who would certainly eliminate that better competition given the opportunity.</p>
<p>If the space is extremely cramped or the colony exceptionally populous, they may also send a couple more swarms with newly emerged queens rather than having them duel down to one...</p>
<p>Ideally the best new queen takes the original colony... the old queen starts up a new hive elsewhere... if they're especially fortunate 2-3 minor swarms with new queens also begin anew.</p>
<p>Those minor swarms do not have great odds of survival but sometimes nature finds a way.</p>
<p>Update: thanks so much for all the gifts and goofy comments you all made my day = )</p>
<p>I've only been a bee keeper for a single season, but I take that responsibility seriously so I've tried my best to learn as much as I can so I can be a proper steward of my lil beebies.</p>
<p>I wouldn't call myself an expert by any means but I tell myself to learn like I'll live forever and serve like there's no tomorrow. I try to spend at least a little chunk of time learning more about bees everyday! They're fascinating and I'm a biologist so it's really a joy to learn all about them!</p>
<p>I'd like to encourage anyone and everyone who isn't allergic to work with bees and learn about them and help local bee keeper or become one yourself!</p>
<p>They're marvelous creatures and truly altruistic... working with them has been extremely rewarding and fulfilling... the hardest part is waiting for winter to pass.</p>
<p>As for how the bees select their favored queen? I guess that's one of their secrets, I only know about it because I've seen the way some workers guard their favorite unopened queen cell. I could scratch up a few paragraphs of ideas about factors that go into it but I'm already rambling hahaha... likely there is a lot to it.</p>
<p>Thanks again guys support local bee keepers and get your hands in the mix, most bee keepers are old timers and the industry needs more youthful energy and innovation!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When there is too much honey in a hive they use it to keep themselves warm over the winter. They use the sugar in honey to sustain warmth so they don’t die. They eat the honey and vibrate around to create warmth. Bees live in a ball inside a hive. They stay at the bottom of the hive in the beginning and throughout the winter they move up towards the food source. Bees honey is mostly found at the top of the hive. If they have any left they use it to feed the bees and keep them alive for the next year. If they get too crowded for their hive, they swarm and take the old queen with them. The remaining bees can feed jelly to a newly laid egg and turn it into a queen. Usually a bee keeper knows when to split a hive. </p>
<p>Side note: if you do not leave enough honey your bees will die over the winter. </p>
<p>Other side note: I’m a hobby bee keeper in Maine, the winters are brutal. I love beekeeping, so if you have any other questions I’d be happy to help :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
