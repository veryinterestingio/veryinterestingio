		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you hear a music, ambient sounds, people talk or anything with sound. You can just focus on 1 sound and isolate all other like when hearing a music or musical instruments you can focus on the violin sound or the trombone or the flutes or maybe hear only a certain frequency or a specific person talking. How does the brain know what to isolate and focus on, And how does it do it?</p>
<p>Edit: Thank you all so much for your comments and answers, I really appreciate them. This question has been bugging me for a few weeks and I couldn't really find an answer on Google since Google just gave me how do you sound proof a room or isolate a frequency with speakers. It wasn't really reliable so I decided to ask real people what they thought. Again I thank you for your time and consideration to answering this question and i hope some of you out here on Reddit who might have had a similar thought about it now finally have an answer. Thank you all.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a central question in a lot of areas of hearing research, especially related to how we can comprehend speech in noisy environments (see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_party_effect" target="_blank">Cocktail party effect</a> for some background). At a basic level, this problem involves a couple steps. </p>
<p>First is the task of separating the mixture of sounds that our ear processes at the cochlea into auditory objects - think different voices, instruments in music, or similar. This involves (partially overlapping) processes called auditory streaming, source segregation, and scene analysis, terms which will get you a lot of relevant results if you search them. Essentially, hearing at the earliest stages involves a natural process decomposing sounds into frequency components (e.g., high pitch and low pitch sounds, albeit with much greater precision than that) akin to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_analysis" target="_blank">Fourier decomposition</a> of the sounds arriving at your ears. From there, there are brain regions involved in reversing this process to infer the sources of different sounds, so that you can identify things like who, what, and where sounds are. This process is highly complex and only partially understood, but relies on many cues, including onset/offset times of sounds, frequency information, listener expecatations and the prior likelihood of a sound occuring, and others. <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/shinn/publications/pdfs/2019/2019cogneuro_shinn.pdf" target="_blank">Shinn-Cunningham (2019 &lt;- pdf)</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-51662-2_1" target="_blank">Middlebrooks and Simon (2017 &lt;- paywalled)</a> have nice overviews with some more detail.</p>
<p>Just as you mentioned, once we've isolated objects, next comes the process of picking one out to focus on, a process typically referred to as selective attention. This is a process much better understood in visual perception than auditory perception. It may seem fairly simple how, once the objects in the environment have been separated, we can pick one to focus on. However, in the brain this is a complicated process and involves coordinating, for example, the need to focus on things that are relevant to your current goals (like listening to your friend in a restaurant) and monitoring for other important sounds (you don't want attention to your friend to prevent you hearing someone should 'Fire' or the restaurant calling out the number for your order). [As an interesting aside, one finding in this field is that it's difficult if not impossible to focus on two objects at once -- multitasking doesn't really occur when listening to sounds -- and if you think you can do it, you're probably just switching attention back and forth rapidly, which tends to impair your performance at both tasks]. Searching auditory attention or auditory selective attention will give you a lot of resources on this topic, and the the Shinn-Cunningham article I cited earlier goes into some detail as well.</p>
<p>TL;DR: the auditory system is adept at separating a mixture of sounds into its component objects by relying on many cues like onset/offset times and many others, and after doing this uses attention to focus on a single object at a time to suit your needs.</p>
<p>This is the tip of the iceberg on this topic and didn't want to go to deep here, but I'm happy to answer more questions if people have them!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
