		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whoa whoa whoa, there is a lot of crazy language being thrown around in this thread. Let's start at the basics. </p>
<ul>
<li>There are no bad foods</li>
</ul>
<p>The things we think of as bad, are actually one of the best things for us from a survival standpoint. Our bodies evolved to crave sugar and carbs because they are incredibly valuable to us. They are rare sources of calories dense food. For this reason our body desires them and our body stores fats from them. All great things!</p>
<p>Until you have a constant supply of these foods and consume them 2-3 times a day in large quantities. Now they become a problem because your body is still treating them as a rare thing, telling you to eat more of them, and storing away all that fat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like why can't we just make a burger from healthy stuff</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can that's not a problem. But until we find a way to trick the body into believing it ate carbs and sugars when it ate something &quot;healthy&quot;, we will never solve the problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our bodies are programmed to reinforce liking fats, salts and other things that used to be in short supply, but are needed for life (in moderate amounts). </p>
<p>With modern methods those substances can be added easily to enhance the appeal of food.</p>
<p>When you have a little of those things, you want more. When you have more, you still want more. Over the years of your life you've turned the volume up on those things by having more and more of them. Like after listening to music too loud, when you hear something quiet, it's harder to hear.</p>
<p>Now, add in industrial food production. Modern grocery store tomatoes are not bred for flavor or nutrition, but to ship well. (Literally, in the USA many are shipped by boat from New Zealand) Delicious heirloom tomato varieties are more fragile and need to be handled gently, so they don't do well being tossed around on a truck, and don't last for weeks on a shelf.</p>
<p>Since the shelf stable tomatoes taste like cardboard, we add salt and fat to make it more appealing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are programmed by evolution to really really like specific rare food stuff like high calories (fat/sugar/starch), protein (meat/or glutamate as sign of protein) and minerals (different salts).</p>
<p>Only a hundred years ago, this was all still hard to get for most humans. And in some parts of the world still is!</p>
<p>So thanks to the industrial revolution we suddenly have an abundance of this foods, but our evolutionary programming is still active and makes us eat as much as possible.</p>
<p>Note that the unhealthy part is only the amount we eat. In historic times, getting enough calories was a matter of life and death.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Answer:  I’m not sure there’s a scientific answer for your question.  Unless one has a medical problem that changes the way foods taste, like—most recently—Covid or in some people, diabetes, your tongue has the same taste receptors and it all comes together in the same way.  But you specifically mentioned a fast food burger, and the consensus seems to be that most restaurants use an enormous amount of salt, compared to what we use at home.</p>
<p>But many “healthy” alternatives to hamburger use quite a bit of salt.  I suspect the biggest problem is personal taste.  A veggie burger doesn’t meet your expectation of what a burger will taste like.  It isn’t “bad” so much as just not right.  </p>
<p>I’ve long held the suspicion that expectation plays a big part in this.  We <em>expect</em> healthy foods to be a bit boring or flat, and it tastes “not right” and we translate that to not good.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
