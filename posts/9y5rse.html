		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It sound like you are good with the idea that if you push an object with a set force for twice as long of a time it will end up going twice as fast. Work isn't based on time though, it's based on distance.</p>
<p>So, let's say you push an at rest object for 10 meters and get it going 4m/s. Then, you keep pushing it for another 10m. However, since it was already moving at 4m/s, it takes a lot less time to cover the second 10m than it did to cover the first 10m. As a result of this, there isn't enough time to speed up as much as happened during the first part. When you do the math, it works out that you would have to push it an additional 30m to double the speed and get it going 8m/s, and this additional 30m of pushing would take the same amount of time as it took to push it the first 10m.</p>
<p>You have to push for twice as long to go twice as fast, bust since you are already moving as you start the second half of the pushing time, you end up pushing for a greater distance than during the first part.</p>
<p>Work, to algebraic simplification, is Force x distance. The Kinetic Energy gained by the object you push is equal to the work you did in pushing it. To push an object from rest and get it going twice as fast, you had to push it four times as far, doing 4 times the work. Thus, the energy must depend on the square of the speed.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can look at the mathematical derivation of it at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy#Derivation" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy#Derivation</a> to get the result fromt interrelation of momentum  You can the the same without any explicit integration</p>
<p>A way to look at it is to try to calculate what energy is need to accelerate a object. </p>
<p>Newtons second law is force= mass*acceleration , F=m *a  </p>
<p>Speed it acceleration times time , v=a*t .</p>
<p>Work is force times distance, W=F*s</p>
<p>To accelerate a object from 0 to speed v  with constant acceleration takes t=v/a. </p>
<p>The average speed of constant acceleration is half the top speed or v_a=v/2</p>
<p>The distance traveled to accelerate the object will be s=v_a *t= t *v/2= v/a *v/2= v *v/(a *2)= v^2 /(a *2)</p>
<p>The total work is W=F<em>s or W= m *a *v^2 /(a *2) = m *v *v/2 *a/a= m \</em>v^2 /2</p>
<p>So from the simple linear equation of moment you can derive that the energy needed to accelerate a object is proportional to the square of the speed.  That is the same as the kinetic energy of the object.</p>
<p>The part that is the reson for the square is that the both the average speed and the time for the acceleration both depend on v and when you calculate the distance traveled you need to multiply them so the result is v^2,</p>
<p>Not exactly a explanation for a five year old but when you start to calculate physics with some equation and get introduced to things like  kinetic energy and  proportional  you will know the other used physic formulas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The squaring happens (simplistic but close enough) because you have two things at work - the actual change in velocity (say 0 to 60 in a car) and how quickly you want to get there.  The two factors ( how much and how fast) are multipled so tada a square.</p>
<p>This is why uncle gofasts sports car goes 0 to 60 in half the time of the minivan but costs 4 times as much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
