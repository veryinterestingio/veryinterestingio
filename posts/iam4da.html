		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Petting is just slightly different grooming behavior which is basic social mammal behavior to keep your coat clean. It also feels good, social animals like being touched by members of their group and also have stimulus responses like how it feels good to have your face or neck stroked by you partner. It's an important part of bonding in basically every social mammal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can tell you about goats.</p>
<p>When a baby goat nurses, its mother nuzzles its back just ahead of its tail. The baby goat's tail wags in response. </p>
<p>I have raised a lot of baby goats on bottles. These four were orphans:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/NxjwAj7.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/NxjwAj7.jpg</a></p>
<p>They are almost a year old now, and still wag their tails when I scratch them just above their tails. They also love to be petted and stroked. Their cousins, who have mothers, spend a lot of time cuddling with their mothers, even long after they are eating solid food. Animals just like contact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Likes to climb and jump....  basically get into trouble. 9 out of 10 times wounds up flipped on her back, when she does... we quickly turn her over and she immediately likes to be comforted with hugs and pets. If we don't she hisses dissaprovingly. It's adorable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
