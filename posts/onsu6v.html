		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>2 Reasons:</p>
<p>1 - To get visual damage reports when something malfunctions:</p>
<p>Pilots cannot see what's out the window behind them.  Unlike in a car there's no rear visibility because there's just a big wall behind them in the cockpit, and also there's no rear-view mirror because the airflow has to stay clean (can't have a big side mirror jutting out the side of the plane).</p>
<p>This means that if there's a major problem with the wings or engines, they literally cannot look at it.  They have readings on the instrument panel that make it clear an engine or a wing isn't working right, but they have no visual image of what damage is actually causing those readings.  If the left wing keeps dipping is it because a control surface is stuck or is it because there's damage to the skin of the wing causing it to have less lift?  If the right engine shows all kinds of weird null readings is that because it stopped or because it fell off?  Asking the flight attendants to report what they see out the windows is sometimes the only way to get that information.</p>
<p>Because during take-off and landing everyone should stay belted into their seats, if the pilots ask the cabin crew for a visual report, the flight attendants shouldn't get up and walk in order to open a window shutter.  The shutters have to already be open for them to see through from where they're seated.</p>
<p>2 - So passengers' eyes are adjusted to the outdoors if they have to evacuate:</p>
<p>There have been nighttime crashes where the accident report cited delays in evacuation caused by the passengers being blinded for quite a few seconds because their eyes weren't adjusted to the darkness yet and the crash made the lights go out suddenly.</p>
<p>If you notice, in addition to having you open the window shutters they *also* dim or turn off most of the lights in the cabin such that the only lights left on are the emergency light strips along the aisle in the floor.  This is so the light level inside the plane is roughly the same as the light level outside the plane, giving your eyes time to adjust to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>So that in the event of a crash, the crew can look out and see if there is a fire or other danger outside before beginning evacuation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most procedures like these in planes are to do with preparing the plane and the passengers in case it crashes during takeoff or landing.</p>
<p>Opening windows allows you and the flight crew to see out so you can see if there's a fire near the door.  It also allow rescuers to see in, so they can see if anyone is trapped and still alive.  And it ensures that light can get into the cabin in the case the electrics are fried.</p>
<p>Lights are dimmed for a similar reason -- our eyes are good at adjusting quickly going from dark to light, but really bad going from light to dark.  So they darken the cabin so your eyes can be already adjusted to the dark.  This means that we'll be able to see the way to the doors if the only remaining lights are the emergency lights, or a torch or phone light.</p>
<p>It's also why cabin crew are seated backwards with a 5-point harness, as that is the safer way to be sitting in a crash -- back first.  Also it allows them to keep an eye on the passengers so they can tell them to sit down and strap in again when they inevitably stand up as the plane is about to touch down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
