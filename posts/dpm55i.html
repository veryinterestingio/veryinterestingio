		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simply: Light stretches and the further away something is, the more the light stretches</p>
<p>Less simply:</p>
<p>Waves stretch in accordance to how fast an object is moving towards/away from you, called the doppler effect.</p>
<p>To gauge distance, we must first relate the specific waves (as objects emit more than one, this is very important) to an object. The detected wavelengths are then matched to an existing similar object that is not moving relative to earth.</p>
<p>Using the mathematics of the doppler effect, we can form an estimate of how fast an object is moving away from us. From there, it is possible to estimate the distance from you to the object. This is because there is a natural law in the universe where objects are moving away from you faster the further away you are from it.</p>
<p>Also, different light wavelengths stretch by the same amount for a unit of speed, so the detected spectral lines just need translating to the left or right.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The ELI5 is we measure closer stuff, then a little further, then a little further, until we can measure stuff very far away ans link it back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, you can get a decent measurement of the distance to pulsars by measuring the dispersion of their radio frequency pulses at different wavelengths. </p>
<p>Essentially, the longer the wavelength of the radio waves, the more they are slowed down by the charged particles in the interstellar and intergalactic mediums. The density of these particles is extremely low but over these vast distances it is enough to produce a measurable effect. </p>
<p>This only works on pulsars because you need a discrete pulse in order to measure the distance in travel time. While continuous RF sources suffer from the same dispersion effect there isn't a good way to measure it. </p>
<p>The following link is a good write up on the effect. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some characteristic patterns in radio waves that correspond to emissions of popular elements.</p>
<p>If we see those patterns in a signal, but they are shifted towards the red, we can deduce how far the object was - the further away, the stronger the shift. This is not a very precise method but it's good enough for very far objects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Netflix has a documentary right now called black hole Armageddon that actually explains this well. Essentially we need triangulation in order to determine distance and this mass of an object. They take one reading at one date, then another 6 months later when we are at the opposite part of our orbit (a known fixed distance, forming base of triangle). With the diameter of earth orbit as bass of triangle, scientists calculate the angle of intercept with object to determine length of triangle legs. </p>
<p>After typing all of this, it may actually be the electromagnetic method, not radio... I still think itâ€™s cool.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
