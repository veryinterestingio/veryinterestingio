		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Worked as a cosmetics chemist for 2 years after school. It varies depending on the function of the lotion/cream. If its a general moisturizer very little difference, maybe a slightly different ratio for the thickener to decrease tackiness for something facial rather than something advertised for the body. However if it's something like an acne cream or sunscreen the &quot;active ingredient&quot; would have a significantly different ratio. For example a common active in acme creams is salicylic acid. Ones targeted for the body might have 10-25% more of the acid than facial ones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another cosmetic chemist here: all the products mentioned are moisturizing agents. The difference between lotion and cream is (almost always) only thickness.
Premium products marketed like the aforementioned face, foot and daily/nightly use products (sometimes) contain more premium ingredients that help with exfoliating, cleaning and moisturizing.
And basic cosmetic chemistry: soaps convert fats/oils into products that will wash away with water. Conditioners contain charged 'untangling' groups that straighten hair on a molecular level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Guys, answers from chemists or which are science-based are better than the answers given by estheticians in this thread.</p>
<p>Just a few takes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Retinol is almost useless, it's irritating, in very low concentration in most product (and 90% of the time it's not retinol but a variant). Retinol needs to be transformed by your skin to work. Prescription retinoic acid is what will work best, don't spend your money on retinol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Comedogenic&quot;: this term is whack and is not regulated. Few have tested comedogenicity of ingredients, so take these talks with a grain of salt. However, a few ingredients which are popular for clogging pores: coconut oil, some fatty alcohols.</p>
</li>
<li>Prescription will always surpass whatever cosmetic product you are given (except exfoliants, since they're not prescription but still very efficient)</li>
</ul>
<p>EDIT: since a nice bloke gave me silver, I'll add more:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you cleanse your face at least once a day, you've done 60% of the work to have better skin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't believe this &quot;natural&quot; fad, natural doesn't mean much anyway. Stay away from professionals who are in this &quot;natural&quot; trend. (Iso)tretinoin is synthetically made and is the best way to treat acne for example. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creams with collagen don't do shit. Creams with niacinamide/ascorbic acid (and its variants)/azelaic acid... do. Do your research to know what best active ingredient would work for <em>your</em> problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since an &quot;esthetician&quot; talked about &quot;fillers&quot;... This doesn't mean shit either. Every ingredient has a purpose. I suppose she was talking about silicones. Silicones give nice texture, spreadability, and are nice occlusives compared to paraffine and they don't &quot;clog pores&quot; as much. It's still nice to limit their use though, since there are suspicions that they are not nice to the environment. There are many fine ingredients you can avoid because they're not nice to the environment: palm oil-based and petrol-based ingredients for instance, mica (child slavery), too.</p>
</li>
<li>Don't believe what you read on Google when search an ingredient. Most of the time it's people who say to avoid this or this ingredient when it's perfectly fine, like parabens, phenoxyethanol. Of course, avoid them if you're allergic.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a diference in the texture depending on your skin needs. Your feet needs more thick moisturizer because the skin is very dry and it gets stiff and callosity.
The skin in your face is more sensitive and can be better to use a gel texture or a very light one. For me the pH also matters. Even the skin arround your eyes is different.
Night cream exist to try to add more benefits to the skin but are incompatible with the day (sun, oily, etc).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a 2 years happily married with 2 kids. The differences are mainly the thickness and lubrication aspects of each. Like if I wanted to rub one out in a hurry, say at the toilets at work, I would use a simple face moisturiser as it creates a thin yet highly lubricated surface that dries fast which minimizes clean up. Also it's  acoustically discrete incase there is someone in the next cubical. However, if the wife is out with the kids and I have the house to myself, I'm reaching for that factor 69 sun screen. The  thick sloppy and resilient layer is best suited for those prolonged sessions where you want to shoot the biggest load possible. It's also great for self penetrative if you are into that because of the thick viscosity, it feels more like somone else is entering you. </p>
<p>TLDR, Its environmental, situational and time dependant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
