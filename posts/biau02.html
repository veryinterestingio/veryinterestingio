		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've seen many documentaries that talk about rain forests having infertile soil. When they cut them down to grow soya beans, etc the problem becomes that the soil doesn't have enough nutrients.  </p>
<p>So how can rain forests have such infertile soil yet have the biggest plants and trees in the greatest of volume of plants and trees in the first place?   </p>
<p>I'm quite perplexed! Looking forward to your answers!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the trees pull up the nutrients as rapidly as they're deposited, there is no buildup of nutrients in the soil. The nutrient layer is very much in the surface, there's very little underneath. The trees are living on recycled nutrients of all the trees around them. The same matter goes around and around the cycle. Trees take in the nutrients, grow, make leaves, drop leaves, die, compost down in the top layer of soil, and the sequence repeats. If you have a crop which involves taking nutrients AWAY in trucks to be sold in towns, then there is a NET LOSS of nutrients. They have left the cycle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another reason the Amazon specifically has so much growth, is because <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/nasa-satellite-reveals-how-much-saharan-dust-feeds-amazon-s-plants" target="_blank">The Saharan desert provides massive amounts of nutrition</a> across the ocean, and deposits it into the Amazon.</p>
<p>I can't explain it better than NASA, but suffice it to say dust from the Saharan, which used to be a lakebed, so it contains quite a lot of various minerals and dead microorganisms and such, is carried by wind and dropped all over south and Central America, allowing things to grow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s because most of the nutrients are in the biomass, rather than the soil. The way it was explained to me in geography class was that due to the high rainfall that occurs in the equatorial regions, where rainforests exist. It means that either the nutrients are absorbed into the plants or ‘washed away’ deeper into the soil as the rain moves toward the water table. So plants that exist in rainforests either have adapted to take in he nutrients quickly or have special deep burrowing roots to access what is other wise unreachable.</p>
<p>ELI5: The food at buffet table (nutrients at surface soil) gets replenished and then quickly disposed of (rainfall displacing lighter nutrients and leaving behind heavier sediments) so the patrons learn to either adapt by eating quickly (faster acting roots) or by lowering their standards and digging around in the trashbin outside (deeper reaching roots)</p>
<p>Soy beans may not have such adaptations so the soil is infertile for them in comparison? I hope that shitshow of an analogy makes sense</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that most of the dead stuff (leaves, fruit, animals) doesn't stick around long enough to be composted into soil before it's picked clean by scavengers.  Their nutrients don't really make it back into dirt, so lots of rainforest trees have those surface roots that look like big ribbons to get any nutrients that just hang out near the surface.  There's not much below the surface and therefore really tough to farm crops.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other answers are generally good here, but to clarify about the mineral soil (below the top soil):
When it rains as much as it does in a rainforest, the minerals in soil fall apart into more simple minerals (we call this weathering). Rainforests are the extreme end of this. </p>
<p>In a nice grassland, like the Great Plains of the USA, minerals are like a sticky lunchbox. The can store nutrients both inside themselves and have all kinds of good stuff stuck to their edges. </p>
<p>But in a rainforest, most minerals in the soil are like your dad’s wallet. They are smaller, and the stuff stuck inside is not what you’d want to have for a snack. And they can’t hold any nutrients around the edges, either. Weirdly enough, soils in the rainforest are super deep compared to grasslands, but it doesn’t matter because they’re filled with the wrong stuff for plants to be happy. That’s why the topsoil is so important—see other comments about organic matter and nutrients cycling between plants and topsoil.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
