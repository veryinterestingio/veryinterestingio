<p>Not to confuse with suicidal thoughts. It's not something chronic, just a sudden urge, which goes away just as fast as it came.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's your brain's way of reminding you to not do that thing, as it is probably lethal, and you might be dumb enough to actually try it if you weren't thinking about it. Basically, it forces you to consider what might happen if you were to do that thing, in an effort to get you to be extra cautious and not do that thing.  </p>
<p>It's a lot like those common nightmares that everyone gets. They teach you to avoid things that might actually have been fatal to some of your early ancestors. For example, falling off a cliff is probably bad. Having all your teeth fall out would probably be bad. Finding yourself in class in only your underpants, and thus becoming a social outcast, would probably be bad. Being stuck somewhere dark while something hunts you from the shadows would probably be bad.  </p>
<p>Early ancestors of yours that had these dreams probably avoided cliffs, brushed their teeth, were social, and carried flames with them at night, thus they were selected for, and so these dreams persist as lessons you can learn without needing to experience them yourself. Your brain has a sandbox of imagination to use to get you to not do things that might kill you, without putting you in any danger! Neat!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A mother stands on the edge of a cliff with a baby in her hands. Suddenly a thought enters her head: &quot;What if I just jumped off?&quot; The very idea scares her, and she takes a step back. The next moment a landslide, a wild animal, a sudden gust of wind etc. would have carried her and her child over the edge, but that one step backwards saved her and her offspring's life.</p>
<p>Now imagine a woman who did not get that impulse. Her genes would have been wiped out of the gene pool, while the first woman's genes are still with us. That's why the &quot;<em>appel du vide</em>&quot; instinct is a part of our collective psyche.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
