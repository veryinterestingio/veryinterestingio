		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There were progress being made on their discoveries all the time. It was just slow. There is a continuous line of discoveries from the Egyptians, Babylonians, Greek, Romans, Egyptians again, Arabians, Italians and eventually spreading out throughout Europa. So for example a geometry textbook might first mention something the Babylonians figured out before telling you what a Greek philosopher managed to find out that built on this and then go on to what an Arabian philosopher managed to quantify from this and then on to how the Italians invented a standard notation for it. And you have similar stories with any discovery in most fields of science. They took thousands of years to develop with progress being made all the time by whichever empire had the resources to hire philosophers at that time.</p>
<p>What happened was that a technique called movable type printing press was developed in Germany at a time when Italian city states rich from trade hired a lot of artists and philosophers. This meant that you no longer had to hire a philosopher to go to the only place that had a big collection of these ancient books to study. They could not quickly copy the books and every little kingdom and city could have their own library. So when a blacksmith wondered if he could improve his workshop by installing some sort of automatic hammer he could go to the local library and look up books of famous Egyptians, Arabians or Italians depicting various different mechanisms that he could build for himself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, &quot;the Dark Ages&quot; are an invention by 16th century Italians who had a fetishistic interest in Greco-Roman culture and wanted to feel smarter than their grandparents. Plenty of things were developed during the Dark Ages, including windmills, gunpowder, three-field crop rotation and the Gothic arch. When considering humanity as a whole, progress has been going on pretty much the whole time, it has just been slow, for a lot of reasons.</p>
<p>Agriculture. When 90% of people have to work in the fields to keep everyone fed, there aren't very many people with the time, resources and inclination to think smart things.</p>
<p>Skills. Literacy has not been a common skill anywhere at any point in history (though it was not as rare as some people would have you believe), and a career in being smart would require you to pick up that skill along with at least one new language, instead of doing something more productive like farming.</p>
<p>Access to writing materials. Before the invention of wood-pulp paper, writing materials were expensive. Before the invention or adoption of rag paper, writing materials were expensive as balls. This led to only the bare minimum of things being written down and preserved, and things that were considered self-evident or uninteresting were ignored and therefore lost.</p>
<p>Skilled labor: Before the invention of printing, the only way to get a book was to copy it by hand. Before the invention of moveable type, the only way to print a book was to get a good woodcarver to carve an entire page, mirror-flipped, into a block of wood. The amount of skilled labor involved, and the cost of buying said labor, in spreading texts meant the movement of knowledge was slow.</p>
<p>Lack of contact. Ideas spread and gain traction through trade and exchange of ideas. Some things that appear in isolated places simply didn't leave. For example, none of the Mayan's advances in astronomy ever made it to Europe, and Americans re-invented oil drilling in the 19th century in a way that had been common in China for almost a millenium.</p>
<p>Lack of supporting technology. A lot of people look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolipile" target="_blank">Heron of Alexandria's Aeolipile</a> and say &quot;Oh, if only we could have built on that, we could have had an Industrial Revolution around the birth of Christ!&quot; Well... no. In order to build steam engines, you would have needed to be able to mine and smelt metal on a scale which would make the materials cheap (which didn't happen), make fuel cheap and abundant (which it wasn't, coal wasn't a thing and deforestation was already becoming a problem in much of the Roman Empire), and make the machines in general so cheap to run there was an economic advantage to using them over slaves or animals (which, because of the above, didn't happen). And that's not even touching on the amount of engineering that would go into turning what was, for practical purposes, a glorified executive's toy into an economically viable source of power.</p>
<p>Lack of supporting knowledge: A lot of times, the theories we deride as &quot;primitive and stoopid&quot; actually make perfect sense, given the source data. Take the miasma theory of disease, for example. If the observational data you have is &quot;Touch stuff that smells like shit, get sick, hang around stuff that smells like shit but don't touch it, get sick, stay away from  stuff that smells like shit, don't get sick&quot;, the leap to &quot;smelling things that smell like shit makes people sick&quot; is a significantly shorter one than &quot;parasites we can't see are jumping onto us from the things that smell like shit&quot;. It is also way more useful as an explanatory model than &quot;sometimes gods make us sick&quot;.</p>
<p>Scientific arrogance. It's a lot easier to proclaim yourself smarter than dead people than to actually check what they got right and what they didn't. Scientists are also just as status-conscious and prone to insult-trading and slapfighting as anyone else, and a lot of times the proponents of an old theory have to die off before a new one can gain traction.</p>
<p>Good ol'-fashioned racism. The British spent a century inventing conspiracy theories involving Atlantis and the Jewish diaspora instead of admitting that it was possible black people built the grand cities of central Africa like Great Zimbabwe. The Chinese insisted that China was the most advanced civilization in the world and had nothing to learn from the outside world until the British Empire showed them the hard way that they did and kicked off what was known as the Century of Dishonor in China.</p>
<p>Genuine losses. While the importance of the Library at Alexandria and the Baghdad House of Wisdom are generally overstated, some bits of knowledge were genuinely destroyed and needed to be re-created.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many important Greek works were rediscovered during the Italian Renaissance, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recovery_of_Aristotle" target="_blank">Aristotle</a> and some <a href="https://www.medievalists.net/2010/04/plato-byzantium-and-the-italian-renaissance/" target="_blank">Plato</a> and others. This had an influence on humanism and led to a new emphasis on the Greeks. After this, Greek became an acceptable language to study; very few people in Europe knew Greek before the recovery of Aristotle. Egyptian hieroglyphics were never well known in the Western world, not even in the Roman Era, but we started really deciphering them in the 19th century.</p>
<p>With that said, everyone knew the Egyptians and the Greeks were lit because the Romans would write (in Latin) where their ideas came from (e.g. this theorem is from Pythagoras, this philosophy originates from Zeno). They got credit in that since, but they weren't as emphasized as the Latin works. </p>
<p>Another thing. Before the advent of the printing press, you required a certain amount of political development and social trust for knowledge to really proliferate. No one is going to be putting their head down in books if they're constantly being invaded by neighboring armies. It's not worth the investment. The monastery system and Christianization of Europe helped here <em>immensely</em>. Scandinavia only became properly Christian around 1000, and that's a big deal because in 800 you had Vikings raiding and pillaging monasteries, not to mention the Muslim Empire in the South raiding and pillaging monasteries. So with all of Europe Christian, and insulated from outside threats, and with monks being off limits for killing sprees, the monks were able to travel and share ideas with a level of safety and security that is historically unprecedented. Much of the rediscovery of ancient works were the result of monks and priests, almost all of it actually, whose entire existence was putting their head down in books, translating, learning ancient languages, and shooting the shit over brewskies, naturally leading to creative discovery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It probably had a lot to do with the fact that the major political authorities would collapse without having tried to share much with neighboring empires - the fragmentation and fall of the Roman empire, for example, left much of europe in near complete disarray, and the resulting groups were probably more concerned about survival than technological advancements. The same likely happened with Egypt and several other of the middle eastern empires. I'm no historian but it seems like the middle east in the ancient days was conquered and reconquered every few decades</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All that knowledge was only for the elites. Most people in most cultures would have been completely illiterate.  Imagine if all the knowledge of a culture was aggregated into a small college campus. If there was a generation that didn't really care about a certain subject, that subject would stagnate for a hundred years. And how often would you come across someone who actually digs into a subject? Even more rarely would you come across anyone trying to upend conventional wisdom. And worse yet, when there was a serious war, one side of nobles might be completely eliminated along with their knowledge of a subject until someone from the winning side decided to research the old archives. In some cases as with the ancient Mycenaeans losing literacy in a certain language meant that huge amounts of that cultures knowledge would be lost until it was rediscovered by someone new. That was the norm for all of human history until the enlightenment. Advancement was extremely slow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
