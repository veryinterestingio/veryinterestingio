		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It definitely gets thrown around a lot in contexts where it doesn’t even apply. </p>
<p>Basically, gaslighting is when someone manipulates you in a way that makes you question your own reality. For example, denying things you know to be fact so that you start to become unsure of what’s real or not, and basically pushing you into a position where you can’t even trust yourself and your experiences because they’ve shaken your very sense of certainty in yourself. It’s insidious and awful, and sometimes the perpetrator isn’t even aware of what they’re doing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Remembering the source that coined the term can help keep the meaning strait.</p>
<p>Gaslight was a play about a man who wanted to steal from the apartment of an upstairs neighbor that was recently murdered. When he burgles the apartment he is looking for valuable jewels and must turn on the gas powered lights in the apartment to search.</p>
<p>Gas lights are connected in the building. So turning up the lamps upstairs makes the lights in his own apartment dim. Which is where his wife is. She sees the lights dim, hears creaking floorboards from an empty apartment, and does not know where her husband goes when he leaves.</p>
<p>The play revolves around the husband dismissing his wife's complaints of strange lights and noises and trying to convince her that she is imagining everything. The abusive ways he convinces her that she can't trust her own mind are the original meaning of gaslighting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its an overall manipulation, like moving their cup when they walk out of the room, then when they come back in and ask where their cup is you point to a shelf on the other side of the room and say &quot;you put it there as you walked out&quot;.</p>
<p>Then you change the channel on the television while they're in the bathroom, when they come back and ask why you changed the channel you say &quot;we've been watching this for the last 20 minutes?&quot;.</p>
<p>Then you park their car out by the curb while they sleep, when they ask you if you moved their car you say &quot;You parked there while I swept the driveway, don't you remember?&quot;</p>
<p>You keep doing that with increasingly larger things over a long span of time until they are convinced that they're completely absent minded and have a heavy reliance on you.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't believe how much I don't pay attention to what I'm doing, what would I do without you?&quot;</p>
<p>Then they lose confidence in their ability to do pretty much anything and think its best to run everything by you just to make sure that their stupidity and absent mindedness hasn't missed anything. Pretty soon they rely on you for everything because they can't possibly do anything right.</p>
<p>Eventually you can do whatever the hell you like and they have such little faith in their own ability to even think, that any time they raise any doubt about what you're doing you can just destroy them with examples of all the dumb shit that they've done wrong and completely missed (which was actually just you fucking with said shit) that your logic is the only logic that matters to them.</p>
<p>Its breaking someone's self confidence down so gradually that they don't notice or even stop to think that someone they love and trust would do something so ridiculous and underhanded to them while showing them &quot;love&quot; in every other aspect of life.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't argue, we don't fight, our life together is amazing but I'm just doing all these things that I don't remember doing and I keep ruining everything with my absent mindedness. Probably best that I just listen to my partner when it comes to most things&quot;.</p>
<p>That's gaslighting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically when you know something is the color blue because you know what blue looks like, and you’re explaining that the balloon is blue and the other person laughs and asks if you’re okay and says no the balloon is red. So you look at it and say no, it’s blue, I know what blue is. And they say dude, did you hit your head, it’s red, what’s wrong with you how can you not see that it’s red. So then you get upset and shout it’s blue, and now you’re the bad person for shouting and they say “whoa you need to calm down, I don’t deserve to be yelled at” and play victim even though they are the bad person for lying and manipulating but when you walk away you feel bad for saying it’s blue and wonder if it was red actually and ask yourself if something IS wrong with you... then you start doubting yourself all the time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
