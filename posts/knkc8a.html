<p>And with that being said, how do people see us? Do they see what we see in the mirror? A beauty? Or do they see what we see in the picture? A beast?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two major factors are playing to &quot;distort&quot; your image in a photo in comparison to what you see in a mirror or what your friends see.</p>
<p>1) You've only ever really seen your mirror image, and as symmetrical as we look, there are minor asymmetries which your brain picks up on. Everyone else is used to the way real you looks, and cameras display real-look you, but you're used to mirror you. Seeing real you tends to make your brain feel like something is &quot;off&quot;.</p>
<p>2) The more significant issue is a camera issue. Camera lenses have something known as focal length, which is essentially a way of describing how zoomed-in a lens is. Our eyes are approximately a focal length of 50mm, portraits are typically professionally taken in the 50-200mm range. Your average phone camera sits around 30mm. At wider (shorter) focal lengths, facial features tend to be slightly distorted in ways we don't find attractive (which is why professional photographers don't use them for portraits). </p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.dpmag.com/2017/11/004-Focal_Length_Comparison-1024x545.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a> is an excellent example of the focal length effect I'm describing. You can see at the shorter focal length, the proportions of her face are distorted, it almost appears that her nose has been stretched towards the camera. After about 70mm though, you can see this becomes a much more flattering portrait.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think live feedback is a big part of it, too.</p>
<p>If you can’t see the image, you just pose and hope you look ok. In a mirror (or a selfie) you can make minor adjustments, pose so you look good but not overdo it. I’ve noticed people immediately puff out their chests or stand up strait, or tilt their heads differently when looking in a mirror. Then when they look away they go back to their more everyday posture. When you can see yourself you can present yourself better, even if you don’t realize it. </p>
<p>In a photo taken by someone else you don’t have that subconscious luxury.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well on top of what everyone else already said here i'd like to add that you are familiar with your mirror face and not your camera face. And your mirror is....well a mirrored image.</p>
<p>So any asymmetrical things on your face appear inverted. So for example, if your nose is slightly tilted to the left, in the mirror it will appear slightly titled to the right. And you would think that is your true face, but no. Your true face is the one with your nose titled to the right and you only see that version of yourself in photos.</p>
<p>Now since you are used to your mirror face (nose tilted to the right), when you see a picture of yourself it seems off a bit and maybe you dont know why, because the nose is actually tilted to the left, the correct size.</p>
<p>Obviously this happens with all asymmetrical parts of your face. You basically have a 100% memory of how your face looks in the mirror so any time you see a picture its a bit different because all these things are mirrored. Could be very tiny details but thats why they seem different.</p>
<p>You can make a test of this very easily with a selfie. Take a selfie, and then after its done use the mirror settings on your phone (most phones have this)for the picture to flip it around. Then you will see how your face would in the same scenario in both a mirror and a photo.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With a picture there may be a really distorted version of depth perception. Like you may look really small or big compared to what is first/closer in the photo and how you compare to it. With that being said, I believe a mirror is a better representation of how other people perceive you simply because a picture lacks depth. That's definitely not the only reason, but it does make a difference. There shouldn't be a major difference though, you're still the same person after all. It could be because of how the lighting falls in the specific photo or a face expression you don't normally make.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>When Clark Kent isn't Superman, he parts his hair on the right.  When he's Superman, he parts his hair on the left.  Allegedly one makes you &quot;stronger&quot; which is why the animators did that.</p>
<p>So part your hair differently!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
