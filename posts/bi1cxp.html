		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  And during periods with lower oxygen levels, fires burned more slowly or not at all.  Some natural fuels will burn at high oxygen concentrations but not low.  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3012516/" target="_blank">This article</a> examines these relationships.  Wildfires may actually act to stabilize atmospheric oxygen levels.  If the concentration increases, fires will burn faster and consume the excess.  If the concentration decreases, fires slow down and consume less oxygen, allowing the concentration to rise again.  Check out <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa9ead/pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjUtOaI7vDhAhVQcq0KHTalCjAQFjADegQIAhAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw3QXcy76BSRYJO06lp9ikW0&amp;cshid=1556388642646" target="_blank">this excellent paper(PDF)</a> to learn more about this and other relationships between fire and climate, ecology, evolution, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely - we actually have a ton of fossil evidence for fires during the Carboniferous era, when both biomass and atmospheric oxygen content were high. If you look at the coal deposits from that time, there's a high percentage of charcoal in it. Some of the evidence actually suggests that wildfires may have been a regular feature of Carboniferous forests.</p>
<p>Meanwhile at the end of the Permian, we had a decrease in atmospheric oxygen which contributed to the &quot;coal gap&quot; along with the decreased biomass from the end-Permian extinction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As has been said, the answer is yes. An interesting corollary I haven’t seen mentioned yet, though, is that Earth is the only planetary body we know of on which fires are actually possible. Fire is a redox reaction, in which a reduced substrate (wood in the case of a forest fire) is oxidized by the oxygen in the atmosphere. The wild part is that only on Earth do reduced substrates and an oxidized atmosphere occur together, and it’s only because of life that they do here. Photosynthesis is responsible for nearly 100% of the oxygen that exists on Earth, and thus cyanobacteria, plants, and algae are the reason fire can occur on our planet.</p>
<p>Other bodies can be either highly reduced or highly oxidized, but not both. Saturn’s moon Titan, for instance, is covered in oceans of liquid methane. This would be a dangerous occurrence on Earth, but there’s no oxidant available on Titan for the methane to react with, so it will never burn. Mars on the other hand has an oxidized surface, but no reduced substrates that could burn even exposed to oxygen.</p>
<p>The fact that fire can only occur on Earth because life has produced enough oxygen to change the composition of our entire atmosphere means that wildfires are a very good candidate biosignature if we can detect them on other worlds. We just don’t know of any way for them to occur on lifeless planets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. NASA experimented with 100% oxygen in space capsules, as to have to ship up less nitrogen, since sending things in orbit is extremely pricy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_1#Choice_of_pure_oxygen_atmosphere" target="_blank">They changed out of this amongst other reasons because a fire started in Apollo 1 which burnt out the entire cabin and overpressurised it within half a minute.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Insects would also be much bigger with higher oxygen levels.  I can't remember where I read this, but it's something to do with them not having lungs and 'breathing' through spiracles.</p>
<p>I'll have a look and see what I can dig up.</p>
<p>/edit the original article years ago mentioned spiders being bigger, but I can't find that exact article.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://owlcation.com/stem/How-Spiders-Breathe" target="_blank">I have found</a> that some species of spider do use book lungs and spiracles to breathe, so a higher oxygen content should lead to bigger spiders.</p>
