<p>If I remember correctly the last time someone posted this, taste buds are more sensitive when they are warm, and less sensitive when cold. So at each temperature you get a different flavor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Hot and cold things tend to taste less strongly than mid-temp things, and also hot water specifically carries more air and minerals in the mixture. The minerals in your water can play a big part in the taste.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question reminds of this Douglas Adams quote:</p>
<p>“It is a curious fact, and one to which no-one knows quite how much importance to attach, that something like 85 percent of all known worlds in the Galaxy, be they primitive or highly advanced, have invented a drink called jynnan tonyx, or gee-N'N-T'N-ix, or jinond-o-nicks, or any one of a thousand variations on this phonetic theme.
The drinks themselves are not the same, and vary between the Sivolvian ‘chinanto/mnigs’ which is ordinary water served just above room temperature, and the Gagrakackan 'tzjin-anthony-ks’ which kills cows at a hundred paces; and in fact the only one common factor between all of them, beyond the fact that their names sound the same, is that they were all invented and named before the worlds concerned made contact with any other worlds.”</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Temperature of something changes its chemical reactivity, but also as the temperature of water rises it loses the ability to retain dissolved gases.</p>
<p>So one of the things we do to make water palatable is put the little screen on our water taps, called aerators, so that The water doesn't taste all &quot;flat&quot; coming out of the tap.</p>
<p>Evolution has designed us to prefer running water over still water because running water is usually not stagnant and so is less likely to be disease ridden.</p>
<p>So as you heat the water you taste more of its mineral, salt, and ion content as it loses dissolved oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen.</p>
<p>The removal of dissolved gases is also strongly implicated in my boiled water freezes faster than tap water. Getting rid of all those gases helps the thermal transfer of the water itself.</p>
<p>There's like a whole bunch of science happening in all sorts of different directions. And there's a whole bunch of biological reasons for our body to be sensitive to all of these elements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
