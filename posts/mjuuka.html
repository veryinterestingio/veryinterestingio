		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lower gravity does means lower pressure if you have the same density &amp; height of atmosphere - the pressure at ground-level is density * gravity * height for fixed density &amp; gravitational acceleration.</p>
<p><em>But</em> density is a bigger factor for lift, and the density of an atmosphere can vary hugely between planets and moons. The complex details of formation mean that some planets and moons just end up with more gas on them than others.</p>
<p>Just within our solar system, Venus is almost as big as Earth, but the gas density at the surface is over 50x that of Earth. Saturn's moon Titan is 2% of the mass of Earth, but has an atmosphere thicker than Earth's. Mars is 10% of the mass of Earth but has an atmosphere &lt;1% of Earth's. There's a huge variation, and no absolute correlation. You can have big planets with almost no atmosphere, and moons with very thick atmosphere.</p>
<p>So you can actually get the ideal situation - a low mass/low gravity moon with a thick atmosphere. Titan is the easiest place to fly in the Solar System, as illustrated in <a href="https://xkcd.com/620/" target="_blank">this xkcd strip</a>. There is a planned mission to send a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly_(spacecraft\)" target="_blank">robotic rotorcraft to Titan</a>, which will be very cool. It's also a great place for balloons - you could have a probe just float around in the atmosphere. We are currently testing a rotorcraft on Mars, but the thin atmosphere of Mars means it will be limited to quite short flights.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A denser atmosphere will make it easier to fly, but harder to accelerate while flying.<br />
Thinner atmosphere will be harder to get a good lift, but once you get it, you will be able to accelerate way faster.  </p>
<p>This is due to the resistance the atmosphere will cause.  </p>
<p>The same way it's way harder to sink on water, but you cannot travel fast swimming (even boats or submarines cannot go as fast as, let's say planes), while on air, it's impossible for a human to &quot;swim&quot; in air without more effort and equipment, but once you manage to overcome flying, we can travel much faster through air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With everything else fixed, a lower gravitational constant reduces the contribution of hydrostatic pressure but ignores the contribution of variations in temperature or density  in the atmosphere. </p>
<p>Flying also isn't necessarily easier:
1) A thinner atmosphere may mean a more elaborate engine design is needed.
2) Depending on the temperature you may also need to revaluate the risk of ice formation on the aircraft structure - this can alter the shape of the wings and change aerodynamic performance as well as adding structural weight which may alter stability.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
