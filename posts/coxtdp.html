		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We of course have no idea what a Megalodon actually looked like. However, there are some significant reasons to think that Megalodon looked very similar to a Great White.</p>
<p>1) Megalodon was likely, like the Great White and Mako sharks (among others) a <a href="https://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/sharks/anatomy/Blood.shtml" target="_blank">semi-warm blooded shark (endotherm)</a>. This has to do with the <a href="https://youtu.be/aHKcxyCbWu8?t=264" target="_blank">position of the muscles within the body</a> as well as other parts of the anatomy. This ability to raise their body temperature allows them to perform necessary hunting feats for sharks of that size. Without this advantage, it's unlikely a shark as large as a Megalodon would have been able to support it's bulk.</p>
<p>2) The coloring of large sharks like the Mako and Great White are very similar. The reason for this is simple; it makes them blend in with the deep blue depths when <a href="http://www.oceanwideimages.com/images/5916/large/great-white-shark-24M2655-05.jpg" target="_blank">seen from above</a>, and makes them blend in with the white surface when <a href="https://www.naturepl.com/cache/pcache2/01544394.jpg" target="_blank">seen from below</a>. </p>
<p>3) The <a href="https://i.imgur.com/zW7ycqK.jpg" target="_blank">tooth shape</a> and vertebrae of the Megalodon, the only fossil records we have, indicate that it's closely related to the Great White, suggesting they likely looked very similar.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.britannica.com/animal/megalodon" target="_blank">This</a> is a pretty good rundown about what we know about Megalodons, and why we believe them to look like Great Whites. You're correct, however, to be skeptical. For all we know Megalodons just had ridiculously oversized teeth for their size.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is extremely accurate according to the information we have, Megalodon is a species of shark from only 23-3.6 million years ago, Mackeral Sharks(which it descends from) on the other hand are <del>425</del> \~120 million years old. We're able to guess its size <a href="https://cdn.britannica.com/s:700x450/46/200146-004-027139A0.jpg" target="_blank">based on the teeth</a> we've found over the years. Thankfully evolution tends to be very slow and as a result you won't see a ton of differences over time which allow us to more or less accurately assess what a creature looks like based on the characteristics we see from members surrounding it.  </p>
<p><strong>edit</strong>, Lamniformes (Mackeral Sharks) appeared in the early cretaceous period around 120ish million years ago, my bad!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There seems to be some misunderstanding due to people not being caught up on research. This needs to be cleared up because some out-of-date things are being very confidently stated by some. Cliff Notes version:</p>
<p>People used to think it was a Great White relative because the teeth are similar and named it <em>Carcharadon megalodon</em> (Great Whites are <em>Carcharadon carcharias</em>). That's when the paleoart started, and paleoart can be very derivative sometimes. Hence the trend of similarity in depictions.</p>
<p>Then more research happened and people realized it wasn't quite that close. Perhaps closer to makos, which are in the same family as Great Whites (Lamnidae). They erected a new genus, renaming it <em>Carcharocles megalodon</em>. There were other disagreements and names that weren't as widely accepted, but no one's been talking about those here. </p>
<p>While it isn't solid yet, the consensus is getting stronger and stronger that it wasn't even in the same family as Great Whites and makos. It's in a completely extinct one---Otodontidae.</p>
<p>Otodontidae and Lamnidae are both in the same order, Lamniformes, but lamniforms don't all look alike any more than all primates (also an order) look alike. Other living lamniformes include: <a href="http://www.scubatravel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/C5A2138-725x484.jpg" target="_blank">threshers</a>, <a href="https://oceana.org/sites/default/files/styles/ntsc/public/porbeagle.jpg?itok=4oaByzia" target="_blank">porbeagles</a>, <a href="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/5bae466429f2cc29475d636e/1550169587731-V8NWHYZ0V135XQYY2KPO/Megamouth-shark.jpg?content-type=image%2Fjpeg" target="_blank">megamouths</a>, <a href="https://en.es-static.us/upl/2016/08/goblin-shark-video-still.jpg" target="_blank">goblin sharks</a>, <a href="https://www.wunc.org/sites/wunc/files/styles/x_large/public/201904/sand_tiger_sharks_image_3.jpg" target="_blank">sand tigers</a>, <a href="http://www.finsunited.co.nz/uploads/1/9/2/0/19203207/urn-cambridge-org-id-binary-20170810073601831-0953-s1755267213000778-s1755267213000778-fig3g_orig.jpeg" target="_blank">crocodile sharks</a>, and <a href="https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/2763198/size/tmg-article_tall;jpeg_quality=20.jpg" target="_blank">basking sharks</a>.</p>
<p>Lamniformes evolved over 100 million years ago in the Cretaceous. In spite of what people who haven't thoroughly examined the data claim, sharks <em>do</em> evolve and their appearance <em>has</em> changed over time. There's no such thing as a &quot;living fossil&quot;. I haven't found an image of a phylogenetic hypothesis of Lamniformes including the extinct families or estimated divergence dates between <em>Otodus</em> and <em>Carcharadon</em> yet (if anyone has, please link to them in a reply). Without knowing what modern families it's most closely related to, any suggestions of what it looked like beyond discussions of drag reduction, needing to have a morphology that helped them bite whales, and suggesting characteristics shared by <em>all</em> lamniformes is hand-waving.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just adding on to the excellent answers in this thread, <em>megalodon</em> was once thought to be much more closely related to Great Whites than it is now known to be, which would’ve influenced reconstructions a bit. While this is more of a personal belief, I also assume that media depictions of the animal have a bit of “follow-the-leader” going on- the first famous reconstructions of the animal looked like a giant Great White, and others followed suit due to the influence of older works (see also: almost every pop culture depiction of <em>Liopleurodon</em> having the Orca-style skin markings seen in <em>Walking with Dinosaurs</em>).</p>
<p>There aren’t any surviving otodontid sharks that we know of, so we’ll likely never know <em>exactly</em> what they looked like, but basing them on modern relatives is quite common.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
