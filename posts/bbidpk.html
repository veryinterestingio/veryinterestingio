		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The hormone responsible for the absorption of water is known as vasopressin, or the antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Synthesized in the hypothalamus, its activation signals the kidneys to reabsorb the water passing through it to ensure that we aren’t dehydrated, while its deactivation signals the kidneys to allow water to pass through, ensuring that we aren’t overhydrated.</p>
<p>the simple reason why we don’t feel the urge to urinate when we’re asleep is that the brain, recognizing that the body is at rest, increases the production of ADH. The excess ADH forces the kidneys to reabsorb any water passing through and recirculate it into the bloodstream. As a result, absolutely no urine is produced.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s a few things going on here:</p>
<p>Brain: while asleep, the sympathetic nervous system is suppressed and parasympathetic is activated. This does a lot of things, but the important ones here are that they slow heart rate and decrease systemic blood pressure.</p>
<p>Heart: blood pressure and heart rate are decreased by the brain. This results in decreased cardiac output (amount of blood moved by the heart per beat). Any time CO decreases, the amount of blood moving through our organs, including the kidneys, also decreases.</p>
<p>Kidneys: decreased perfusion in the kidneys makes your body think your blood volume is low. This encourages the activation of a hormone system (the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system) designed to reabsorb water in the kidneys in order to increase blood volume. Pulling the water out of urine decreases the volume of urine produced (and concentrates waste products, which is why your first urine in the morning is usually darker and more pungent than through the rest of the day). This reduces the volume of fluid in the bladder, which reduces stretch reflex of the bladder and the internal urethral sphincter (which is what causes the urge to pee).</p>
<p>There are other changes in other systems (like metabolism, the GI tract, and so on) and a number of hormones that are responsible for those changes, but the net effect of most of them is less perfusion of the kidneys &gt; kidneys reabsorb water from the urine to correct perfusion issue &gt; lower volume of urine produced &gt; less urge to pee. </p>
<p>The funny thing about this, though, is that the problem isn’t volume, it’s the brain decreasing cardiac output. So the increased volume (from retaining water) will increase cardiac output, eventually beyond the brain’s ability to trick the body into thinking it’s too low. This will suppress the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and water moving into the urine will go back to normal for a while before CO is low again and it turns back on. We kind of oscillate between these two points through the night, resulting in MUCH less urine volume than we would produce if we were awake for that same time.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the bladder will get to the point where urgency would make us void. However, initiation of a urine stream is mostly voluntary and we begin feeling urinary urgency long before the bladder is actually full. We consciously choose to void to alleviate that urgency. While asleep, we don’t perceive the urgency from the stretch reflex (until it gets to a much more severe level), so we don’t consciously choose to void. People who wet the bed or have bladder leakage often either don’t have adequate control of the internal urethral sphincter And/or inadequate muscle tone to retain the urinary volume, in which case they will void involuntarily.</p>
<p>For some people who wake in the middle of the night needing to void, this urgency is enough to wake them up (lots of reasons including smaller bladder volume, prostate issues in men); they wake up for another reason and become consciously aware of the urgency (sleep apnea, light sleepers), or damage to the organs that run the above mechanisms results in failure to reduce volume of urine produced at the bladder gets much closer to full (intensifies urgency and makes it more likely urgency will wake them so the bladder doesn’t rupture). Most adults will wake before they involuntarily void. Many children will not.</p>
<p>If you notice, the brain has a VERY key role in both of these mechanisms. There’s a reason for that, too. Uninterrupted sleep is very important to the brain for cognitive function. So, more than likely, these mechanisms developed over time in order to facilitate that. MANY other mechanisms exist for facilitating uninterrupted sleep, but this is kind of an overview of how the body prevents the bladder from waking us up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
