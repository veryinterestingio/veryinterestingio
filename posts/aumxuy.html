It's a completely different type of solid material in the way it's made  from interconnected long chains of repeating molecules.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Regular borosilocate glass is an amorphous solid. It has an irregular structure. And despite what the internet tells you, glass is 100% a solid. A non-crystalline solid.</p>
<p>Generally a slower solidification results in larger crystals as the molecules have time and energy to reorient themselves into a more energetically favourable configuration. And conversely there are plenty of materials can be cooled sufficiently quickly so as to minimise the grain size or avoid crystalline grains altogether. This is the goal of flash freezing vegetables so that there are no crystals of sufficient size to rupture cell walls.</p>
<p>Whilst most metals have undergone crystallisation during casting, you can create amorphous 'glassy' metals by controlling impurities and cooling them quickly. These metals have a pretty lustre and some good mechanical properties, making them useful for golf clubs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Glass is a good example. As would any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amorphous_solid" target="_blank">amorphous solid</a> which lacks the long range ordering that characterizes a crystal lattice.</p>
<p>When we say &quot;order&quot; we are asking the question: &quot;If I know the positions of a few atoms locally, do I also know the positions of faraway atoms?&quot;</p>
<p>For a crystal, the answer is yes. For glass, the answer is no. Medium and short range order though is definitely present in glass. There is actually a rich connection between the amorphous solids and liquids:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A naturally occurring example would be obsidian. Its amorphous structure is what made it such an attractive raw material for stone tool-using peoples. When force is directed into obsidian during flintknapping, it has an equal potential to travel in any direction, making controlled flaking much easier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most solids are either crystalline (has a lattice structure, e.g. NaCl) or amorphous (only has short range order, e.g. glass). A third type of solid is quasicrystals, which don't have a repeating structure but can still be described mathematically. They're very rare (I think the only naturally occurring samples were found in meteorites) but their discovery did earn a Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>Edit: I should say that many solids are in between crystalline and amorphous. For example many plastics are made of polymers chains that will stack or align in a predictable manner but don't have long-range order because of sterics (the shape/size of the molecule won't pack nicely) or some other reason (e.g. the polymer forms too quickly). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
