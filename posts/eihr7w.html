		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body doesn't actually know how much oxygen is in your blood stream! That's plentiful in our normal environment and not something worth the expense of monitoring, evolutionary speaking. It actually measures the CO2 your body is trying to get rid of and preventing blood toxicity caused by excess CO2 which is an actual daily threat.</p>
<p>CO binds like O2 in your blood, but it's hundreds of times &quot;stickier&quot; and doesn't let go so O2 can't stick. It slowly decreases the amount of O2 your blood can grab until it can't grab any O2, all the while your body thinks everything is great because your CO2 levels are not exceeding dangerous levels. By this point you pass out/die without realizing what is happening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The pain you feel and the urge to breathe is not from lack of oxygen, rather it is a build-up of carbon dioxide in your bloodstream. The body senses that it is not getting rid of CO2 and wants to breathe more. Carbon monoxide (CO) however isn't detected by the body, it is odorless and colorless, hence the danger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of my friends said she was getting monoxide poisoning for several weeks. She was in a LOT of pain (to the point she thought she was dying) and couldn’t think. She would go to urgent care and eventually the hospital, they couldn’t find anything wrong because she would be getting fresh air there. But back home she would feel the effects again. After post on FB, another old classmate suggested testing her house. Sure enough her heater was leaking and poising her. She has gotten the issue fixed and is doing well now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can answer from personal experimentation! As others have said, the feeling of the need to breathe is not due to lack of oxygen, but build up of carbon dioxide. Once when my friends were doing nitrous oxide (I'm life-long sober) I realized I could test this (this was before the internet was available for easy research). So I breathed out, and breathed in a full lung-full of nitrous, and held my breath. Unfortunately I didn't think to time it, but sure enough, no need to breathe. I got numb head to toe, giddy, and eventually my vision was going black and I lazily thought, &quot;Wow, still no need to breathe. But losing consciousness would be bad. I should breathe. Yeah. Definitely should breathe. What? Oh, yeah, breathe, like, now.&quot; And finally I breathed. Never felt bad.</p>
<p>I did the corresponding negative experiment some time later: block of dry ice in a big sink, breathed out, lowered my face into the vapor and breathed in. At least, I tried. My entire body was immediately filled with electric fire, and I didn't manage half a breath before coughing it out uncontrollably. About the sharpest pain I've ever felt.</p>
<p>So yes, CO2 build up causes the need to breathe, and anything that prevents that and starves you of oxygen will kill you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Holding your breath is hard because of carbon dioxide in your body. </p>
<p>Carbon monoxide is different, and won't make you feel like you need to breathe.</p>
<p>It probably wouldn't <em>hurt</em> (in terms of <em>sensation</em>) to breathe lots of carbon monoxide.<br />
(It would kill you, but you might not <em>feel</em> like you aren't breathing properly).</p>
<p>I'm less confident that a lot of carbon dioxide would make you wake up feeling as if you need to breathe, but I suspect it would.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
