		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Purring primarily seems to be a communication method related to mother-kitten relationship. Especially when nursing, her kittens purring signals the mother that everything is alright. The evolutionary advantage of this is that even a newborn kitten can effectively communicate whether or not its receiving enough milk and is in good health. When adult cats purr by themselves, this is apparently simply a &quot;vestige&quot; of this nursing behaviour.</p>
<p>Similarly, the mother purring most likely has a calming effect on the kittens. Think of it as a guitar string starting to vibrate when you strike the same string on a different instrument nearby. Cats also use purring for communication between adults. It might be advantageous as an effective communication of peaceful intent to avoid confrontation.</p>
<p>(<em>Lastly, purring has beneficial effects on self-healing of tissue and bones.</em>)
Addendum: Upon further research, this doesn't seem as accepted as I thought. There are many articles about it (<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-cats-purr/" target="_blank">Scientific American</a>, <a href="https://www.spektrum.de/frage/wie-und-warum-schnurren-katzen/1350610#" target="_blank">Spektrum</a> (DE), <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180724-the-complicated-truth-about-a-cats-purr" target="_blank">BBC</a>, to list a few) but many include the same one or two names, which always sets off alarm bells. Also, the only article in a scientific journal (?) I could find is <a href="http://www.animalvoice.com/catpurrP.htm" target="_blank">this one</a>, and I don't know what to think of it. One the one hand, it was published in the apparently respectable <a href="https://asa.scitation.org/doi/10.1121/1.4777098" target="_blank">Journal of the Acoustical Society of America</a> and, from quickly skimming it, it seems plausible and there is non-trivial evidence that vibration has beneficial effects on bone density. On the other hand, the study was original done by the <a href="http://www.animalvoice.com/" target="_blank">Fauna Communications Research Institute</a>, whose website alone makes me question their competence.
[/addendum] </p>
<p>So purring is a <em>result</em> of being content but it can also <em>invoke</em> relaxation and is thus used passively when a cat is happy but also as an active form of communication.</p>
<p>You can observe that if you own a cat. They don't just simply purr but have various different kinds of purring they use under different circumstances.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Understanding the cats purr is still somewhat of a grey area in the study of cat’s behaviour.  The mechanism used for triggering the purr seems to be a neural oscillator in the cat’s brain, which operates the rhythmic tightening and relaxation of the glottis inside the cat’s larynx. As to why they purr, it seems to be a bit more complicated, and dependant on the cat’s personality.  </p>
<p>The current theory is it’s a soothing and healing sound for the cats themselves.  This can explain why cats tend to purr while they are contented, and also why they will do it while they are in pain or under stress.  They also appear to use it as a way of communicating with each other and with their human owners.  For example, a cat can add an extra high frequency note to the purr  to indicate they are hungry to a human.  My cat happens to be doing that right now, she wants her breakfast.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/fappui/does_a_cat_purr_manually_or_automatically_is_it/fiztlnz/" target="_blank">original response</a> was canned due to a lack of references. Here it is with those included:</p>
<p>A cat's purr is similar to a human’s smile. It’s a reaction to an environment, stimuli or internal physical state. This means it can likely be a conscious or subconscious choice. So just like you might consciously choose to smile to make yourself or another feel better, or smile involuntarily at a joke you find funny.</p>
<p>And just like that smile a purr can mean different things. It can express contentment, as we often associate it with petting. A cat can also purr when anxious or afraid.</p>
<p>Regardless, in all of the above it is a form of communication. Purring is a neurologically initiated process that causes vibrations of the cat’s laryngeal muscles at 25-150 Hz. The low end of that spectrum is actually a beneficial range to expedite mammalian healing and studies have shown that a cats purr can do just that.</p>
