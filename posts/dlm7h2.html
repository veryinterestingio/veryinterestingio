</blockquote>
<p>Loans &amp; investments. The people who start a company will often put in their own money and/or sell a portion (a share) of the company to other investors to get the money needed to operate the company while it's still losing money. Funds can also come from loans, but those would usually be secured by assets (often, the founders' personal assets) during a company's unprofitable startup phase – if you can get a loan at that stage at all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>is this common?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, very. Generally companies will have a plan for making their operations profitable through progressive growth over time; this plan is provided to potential investors/creditors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is very common with ride services, particularly Uber and Lyft. They have both received MASSIVE investments to keep them viable until they are actually able to make profit. They essentially have to offer their services at a below profit rate in order to get enough people working for them and build a large enough customer base to become an actual business.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most companies lose money their first few years. You have to buy equipment, sign leases, build your customer base, pay people an incentive to take a risk on your company, etc.</p>
<p>And this is OK, because these costs should decrease dramatically over time. Building a customer base presumably means you'll retain some of them, so you don't need to do as much work. Equipment can be used for a while (although amortization accounts for a lot of that); economies of scale as you grow and train and establish your workers and customers, and so on.  </p>
<p>They operate largely by investors and/or loans--both banks and investors know that companies won't turn a profit right away, so they expect that by having ownership of the company in some manner (or interest payments, at least) so when the profits do start to materialize, they'll get that money and still end up better off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Amazon was losing money for years when it started out. Everyone would joke that people buying Amazon shares were just throwing their money away, like it was the baddest bet on Wallstreet because each year they would report loss after loss. But that was part of the plan all along, take a loss then to build a profit now. And it worked didn't it? Who wouldn't go back in time and invest in Amazon now, if they could.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
