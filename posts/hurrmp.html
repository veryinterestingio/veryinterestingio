		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few decades ago auto manufacturers kept dealerships on a short leash that they yanked hard and often. They’d force the dealers to buy vehicles they new wouldn’t sell, played favorites with dealerships, and jerked them around with pricing and other financial matters. And if the dealerships didn’t roll over the manufacturers would open up a direct dealership across the road for a short time to undercut the dealer and force them out of business then install a more compliant dealer - something the dealerships were fairly vulnerable to as they have a mid-sized fortune financed to get all the cars on the lot. </p>
<p>So the dealerships got together and successfully lobbied in most states to prevent manufacturers from going around them, and also things like limits on how close a rival dealerships could be that sold the same brand cars.</p>
<p>The intent was to rein in the worst of the manufacturer abuses, which they achieved, but then it comes with issues of its own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I never knew that this wasn't a thing in other countries. In europe, or most european countries you can just go to the manufacturers website and configure your new car and after it's produced you can just pick it up at the factory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In some states they can.</p>
<p>In others, there are laws prohibiting manufacturers from selling direct to consumers.  The laws require that they are sold through 3rd party dealerships.  The original purpose was to help ensure that consumers had access to repairs on their cars from reputable sources, but these days it is just dealership's lobbying to keep control of their markets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Manufacturers have chosen the dealer based distribution model because it made sense at the time.</p>
<p>The average person didn't want to order a Ford Truck from a catalogue, they wanted to go to a place where they could see the car, ask questions and test drive it before buying. So having a store front made sense.</p>
<p>By making the dealerships independents (as opposed to be being wholly owned by the car company) they lowered their costs and mitigated the risks of running all those car stores.</p>
<p>In order to support this model the car manufacturers agreed not to sell direct to customers and there-by undercut their network of dealers.</p>
<p>Tesla is the exception to this rule as they sell direct. That caused an uproar with the dealers and they have lobbied to ban Tesla sales in certain states as a result.</p>
<p>EDIT: Some manufacturers do sell direct depending on the State. Fleet vehicle sales may be direct as well. There are factory owned dealerships as well but it isn't the standard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
