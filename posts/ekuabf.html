		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes you can.  There are planes like the CL-415 (scooper) that can skim along the surface and pick up water.  </p>
<p>Rough conditions (windy, large waves) will not allow the planes to do this.  </p>
<p>The salt in the water can eat away at metal,  so the equipment would need to be clean thoroughly after.  </p>
<p>The planes only pick up 2000 or so gallons at a time,  so unless the fire was right near the coast,  and the ocean the only water source,  it would not be a good choice for a water source.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So... What about an intercontinental seawater highway? Or a water version of the electric grid? Could we, over time, create a set of pipes (an interconnected series of tubes perhaps? ;-)  ), that carry sea water across the nation? Desalinization is still a problem, but it sounds like transporting the water is another problem that could be solved. If we had a water grid, desalinization facilities could be feeders off this grid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In some cases we do.  My city has powerful backup pumps that can draw directly from the bay in an emergency.  The fireboats also pump saltwater directly.  I believe the water bombers will use salt water if it is what is closest but it is rarely so.</p>
<p>Then there's the matter of pressure.  A million gallons of water does no good if you have no way to get it onto the fire.  The civil water system is typically gravity fed which provides extremely reliable and consistent pressure. For the amount of water usually needed to fight fires, it is much easier to just tap off the municipal system than to built an entire parallel network of standpipes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can and we do. A lot of harbors have firefighting boats that pump seawater on fires. That has limited reach.</p>
<p>The farther you get from the coast, the more complex the logistics get. Do you pick up the water and dump on the fire? There are planes that do that, but the loads are very limited. Do you pump the seawater to where the fires are? Very slow to deploy this type of system.</p>
<p>The reality is that if the fires are not very close to the coast, it is very complicated to put them out with seawater.</p>
<p>Forest fires are contained by cutting clear around the burning area to stop the fire from expanding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
