There's also quite a good chance we've already eaten some of it, so evolution went &quot;Actually yeah that's a good idea, let's make it so that if we smell something dangerous, we get rid of what we last ate, just in case&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The human body has evolved to avoid dangerous chemicals often by making them smell bad ( ex. Farts smell bad because of hydrogen sulfide) the gagging and puking is basically an advancement of that evolution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your sense of smell is basically just your body's airborne chemical detector.</p>
<p>The way to think of it is there's really no such thing as a 'good' or 'bad' smell. When you smell something, it's just microscopic molecules in the air coming into contact with the olfactory receptor neurons in your nose, this then sends a signal to your brain which decides whether it smells 'good' or 'bad' depending on what it is. It's not 'good' or 'bad' intrinsically, it's just a differently shaped molecule landing on a mucus membrane in your nose.</p>
<p>So, why do some things smell good and some things smell bad? Because some things are harmless or good for us and some things are toxic or poisonous.</p>
<p>You smell dinner cooking and it smells really good, and that's because your brain is basically detecting food nearby which is something you need to survive. When you smell a bad smell, it's because whatever you're smelling is toxic, harmful or could lead to disease.</p>
<p>So, when something smells <em>really</em> bad, that's your body sounding the alarm that something incredible harmful is nearby, and if it smells bad enough, your body activates it's poison reflex. Basically something smells so incredibly awful that your body decides that something incredibly deadly could be in your system so decides to offload it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Smells are not mystical, formless entities. When you smell something - be it someone else’s poop or mom’s pot roast - actual pieces of the thing you’re smelling are floating around &amp; getting into your nose. Next time you smell something terrible, remember that you’re ingesting that stink.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>its part d of our evolution, we learned early on that foul smells are a indication  of a possibly dangerous agent, our brain interpret that, if we are close enough to smell it we may have ingested it and induces the gag reflex  in an effort to prevent being poisoned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
