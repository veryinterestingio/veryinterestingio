		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the main theory is that cats basically socialized themselves.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As we started getting into farming and building early communities we ran into a problem. Pest animals and insects. Eating our crops, making us sick, spoiling our food. Just good times all around.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But this came with a silver lining, for there was a creature that one might say was purfectly adapted to hunting these critters; the cat. And the cats followed their prey to our silos and around our homes. Early humans realized that the cats didn't care about us and just wanted to eat the pests.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So we welcomed our fuzzy saviors and let them hang out. And slowly but surely that moved to bringing them indoors much like you would with a modern day barn cat. At which point we fully domesticated them and started breeding them to customize them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's only one species of house cat, <em>Felis catus</em>. Its closest wild relative is the African wild cat, <em>Felis lybica</em>.</p>
<p>Earliest evidence of domestication is in Cyprus but that doesn't mean it was the first place it was domesticated. Like some other posters said, it's thought domestication happened in cultures that farmed and stored grain, since the grain attracted rodents and the rodents attracted wild cats. Since humans didn't want rodents eating (and shitting in) their grain they encouraged the cats to hung them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dogs didn’t naturally evolve from wolves, they were created through selective breeding. Two nice wolves? Get four sorta-nicer wolf babies. They become more adapted to humans because they’re used to them. Need a dog who won’t hurt your sheep? Breed wolves with dogs who tend towards not eating them. Etc. it is why we have dogs for nearly every thing: herding, guardian breeds, hunting.</p>
<p>If we hadn’t domesticated and selectively bred dogs, we wouldn’t <em>have</em> dogs.</p>
<p>We didn’t really need to breed cats for specific purposes, they just show up. They were and are already useful as they are. I believe most cat breeds are bred for personality and looks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve heard a slightly different take on the above: you could say that they have never been domesticated, but instead adopted us and adapted themselves to the niche we offered. Their ancestors weren’t as different as wolves are from dogs. They are still almost the same creatures physically; modern ones are probably more social. </p>
<p>In part, I’d say we’ve controlled their breeding less; it’s tougher to contain a cat than a dog. Humans have definitely selectively bred them, but just for aesthetics it seems. </p>
<p>So mostly they just are compatible with humans. We feed them, and we and they can share affection and play because we get each other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
