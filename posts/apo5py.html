		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It happens so gradually there isn't a clear moment of &quot;ignition&quot;.</p>
<p>Protostars are glowing hot long before any fusion starts. As they collapse under their own weight they heat up, as any gas will when you compress it. At this phase, the protostar is converting its gravitational potential energy into heat, which provides the pressure that slows its collapse.</p>
<p>As the core continues to compress and heat up, it gradually approaches temperatures where fusion reactions start to become possible. Over many thousands of years, fusion slowly becomes the dominant energy source, replacing the collapse in heating the star. This causes the surface to stop contracting, and the star achieves a stable equilibrium where the fusion at its core produces enough thermal pressure to exactly balance the weight of its gas. This lasts until it runs out of hydrogen to fuse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Refreshed my memory a bit reading <a href="https://astro.uni-bonn.de/~nlanger/siu_web/ssescript/new/chapter8.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> which gives an equation for the duration of the contraction stage of the pre-main sequence star on the bottom of page 110. During that time, fusion is slowly ramping up through a few different kinds of fusion. Deuterium fusion comes first (Hydrogen with a proton and neutron in the nucleus) followed by Carbon-12, with the proton-proton fusion following behind. The term &quot;zero-age main sequence&quot; is used for when the star's energy from fusion balances out the energy its been losing from the surface. </p>
<p>The contraction is slow on human timescales: ~10,000,000 years for a star with 1 solar mass, taking longer for smaller stars and shorter for larger ones. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a gradual event, as stars gradually gain mass.</p>
<p>While gaining mass from the dust cloud, the pressure &amp; heat in the core rises gradually, it won't just happens to ignite like an engine, because when any nucleus fuse with another one, the energy it creates will push materials outward while it will help fuse other nucleus, it will also make an outward pressure the slows down the collapse of materials on the star.</p>
<p>This gradual increase in the rate of fusion helps the star not to explode from the beginning. This rate will keep increasing gradually as matter keeps falling into the star and gives more pressure &amp; heat to the core.</p>
<p>All this will stop when matter no longer falls (the cloud is finished, or part of it created planets or other stars, or it was swiped away by a nearby energetic event) or when the star output energy becomes high enough to stop matter from falling.</p>
<p>Sometimes, if there's a lot of heavier elements in the core then the star will face another a more energetic ignite event later. Like when there's a lot of helium in the core but not enough to start a helium-deuterium or helium-deuterium fusion. But at a later time after the star has already became a star it will either gain more mass or enough helium will be made in the core to start helium-deuterium fusion. Then this happens, the helium fusion requires much more energy to ignite, the core could have enough helium to start fusion but not enough temperature to actually start. So whenever the star gains enough mass or the helium reach critical mass in the core making the core denser and rises the pressure, the helium will start ignition, rising the temperature in the core forcing other helium in the core to start fusing releasing more energy.
This will make the star output spike like another ignition. This happens actually whenever any star start fusion heavier elements. Our Sun will do it after few billion years when enough Helium is made in the core to actually make it fuse. A quick spike in the Sun energy will happens, the Sun will start to grow and convert to a red giant stage as the energy from the core is very high compared to the Sun's mass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we talk about stars &quot;igniting,&quot; we're usually talking about nuclear fusion &quot;switching on.&quot; But the rate of fusion increases smoothly as the temperature in the star's core increases. The time it takes to ignite is kind of ambiguous, but a good metric is the time it takes for the contraction of a protostar to heat up the core from the point where contraction is the dominant source up to the star's mature luminosity. This isn't exactly a scientific measure since the star will actually overshoot its mature luminosity and then quiet back down, but it's probably the fastest time you could reasonably use (unless you just specify a crossover point).</p>
<p>The upshot is that for a star like the Sun, this process takes tens of thousands of years. For the star to actually start visibly shining (beyond a dull red from contraction), the energy from the core has to diffuse up to the surface, which takes several hundred thousand more years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
