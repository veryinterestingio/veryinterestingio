		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wasn't going to answer, but a lot of these answers are missing the main point.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The point of an an engine is to shoot gas out the back as fast as possible. The faster the gas goes, the more thrust per mass you get.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>For gas flows below the speed of sound, increasing the pressure makes them faster. All nozzles, jet or rocket, will include a section that decreases in size. This accelerates the gas until it reaches the speed of sound, and for most jet engines that's all that we do.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>However, rocket engines really need more thrust per mass of gas expelled, because every gram of gas expelled takes up space in a very limited fuel tank, so they accelerate the gasses even more, using what is called a de Laval nozzle (converging-diverging).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>For supersonic flows, the effect of pressure changes. Now, low pressures make the gas go faster, so we expand the gas as much as possible as soon as our flow reaches the &quot;throat&quot;, where the gas flow reaches the speed of sound.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Of course, we can't expand the gas until it has lower pressure than the atmosphere, because then the atmosphere kind of pushes back into the nozzle, and we can get some really weird shockwave-type effects. But that's talk for another day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

You can see on a jet engine it’s a tube with roughly the same size opening on the front and rear, there isn’t a huge difference in pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One main reason is that most aircraft today do not have a jet engine but a turbofan engine. A jet engine lets all air through the combustion chamber but a turbofan engine uses a  turbine engine (jet engine) to drive a large fan. Most of the trust if from the fan. So it is more like a ducted propeller with a lot of propeller blades.  There s an aircraft turbofan engine som commercial passenger jets that push 12x more air around the engine trough it.</p>
<p>Here is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbofan#/media/File:Turbofan3_Unlabelled.gif" target="_blank">animation of a turbofan</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbofan#/media/File:Turbofan3_Unlabelled.gif" target="_blank"> engine</a> and here is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Trent_900#/media/File:Airbus_Lagard%C3%A8re_-_Trent_900_engine_MSN100_(6).JPG" target="_blank">real engine</a>. The turbine engine is the narrower and longer part in the middle and the combustion happens at the waist. So from there, it is quite clear that it expands.  So what you think is an engine might not be an engine but just a large fan.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you look at a jet engine or a low bypass-turbo fan engine like used in jet fighters all or most air travel trout the combustion chamber.</p>
<p>The pressure the nozzle should be at the same pressure at the surrounding air. To high or to low reduce the efficiency.   </p>
<p>If you look at the cross-section of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jet_engine.svg" target="_blank">Jet engine</a> you can see hat the combustion chamber is around the axis of the engine and then you have a turbine and finally an exhaust where you have nothing in the middle.   Because you have something in the middle when you do the combustion the area the gasses passes trough can increase even if the diameter of the engine decrease when there no longer is coming in the middle  </p>
<p>If you look at a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-25#/media/File:Ssme_schematic_(updated).svg" target="_blank">rocket engine</a> you can see them after the combustion chamber diameter decrease to increase the speed of the exhaust and then decrease to reduce the pressure. Because there is nothing in the middle the diameter has to increase. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>To low pressure can result in air that flow back in the nozzle and it can damage it so you tend to build rocket nozzle so the exhaust pressure is slightly above air pressure as a launch but it is not as important in a jet engine because the speed of the exhaust is lower  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:South_Carolina_F-16_taking_off_in_Afghanistan.jpg" target="_blank">F16 with mach diamonds</a>. The pressure in the exhaust is lower than the surrounding air, You can see the exhaust shink when it exits the nozzle</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Because air pressure depends on the elevation to what amount you like to expand the exhaust depending on elevation. So in some aircraft like a jet fighter, you have adjustable exhaust nozzle  So on a F16 an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_%26_Whitney_F100#/media/File:Pratt_&amp;_Whitney_F100-PW-220_turbofan_engine.jpg" target="_blank">expanded nozzle</a> and with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:F-16_Exhaust.JPG" target="_blank">contracted nozzle</a>. So you build the engine so you contract the nozzle at sea level but expand it at altitude. That increase performance at low and high altitude.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>For a rocket, ou does not use expandable nozzle because you have warmer exhaust move at a higher speed so the nozzles have a cooling system in them so they are fixed. But you do have a different nozzle for different altitudes. Her is <a href="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-97bdec5b6797e07652c2c4d1753a5b94" target="_blank">Space X Merlin engine both sea-level and vacuum</a>. The engine is identical but the nozzle is a lot larger for a vacuum engine.  The Falcon 9 has 9 sea-level engines on the first stage but only a single vacuum engine on the second where the nozzle is almost as wide as the whole rocket. The larger nozzle increase the specific impulse (fuel efficiency) by 12%</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Any pressure difference is wasted energy.</p>
<p>Rockets are designed to operate in a near vacuum, so they have a large amount of expansion. </p>
<p>Jets are designed to operate in atmosphere near the pressure of the exhaust.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aerospace engineer here... </p>
<p>It has to do with the fact that the properties of air change with its speed.</p>
<p><em>Main idea</em> is to get air to move really fast in one direction so the reaction causes the vehicle to move equally fast in the other direction. <em>Both engines</em> do this, using an exhaust port.</p>
<p>As air starts to move faster <em>through a decreasing port</em>, there comes a point where the air is moving at the speed of sound. Before this point in time, the behaviour of air can be considered compressible - that is, increasing pressure causes air to compress in a smaller volume. <em>At and after this point</em>, air becomes incompressible - meaning increasing pressure will not cause it to get any smaller in volume -- it literally becomes a rock!</p>
<p>So now imagine air moving so fast, that at the point where it moves at the speed of sound, it is quite literally very, very hard, and the air behind it is slamming into it -- slamming into a rock! Now you have a problem, in that this decreasing port is useless -- you can't move the air any faster.</p>
<p>So for rocket engines, which need to move the air <em>much, much faster</em> than jet engines, some smart guys way back a few hundred years ago discovered that if you use an increasing duct <em>from the point where air is at the speed of sound</em>, the air velocity will keep increasing, and the pressure drops.</p>
<p>The rocket engine duct is increasing <em>only</em> in the visible to the eye section. There is a whole section behind it that is decreasing. This is called a decreasing-increasing, or convergent-divergent duct, and it works for rockets.</p>
<p>For jet engines, the air speed, even at it's highest is nowhere near the speed of sound, so they can keep using the decreasing/convergent duct with no problems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
