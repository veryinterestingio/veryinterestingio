		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add that centuries of agriculture have led to us preferentially breed foods that have a tolerable spiciness. This varies by the culture and environment you grow up in.</p>
<p>The spicy foods you eat today are not by random chance but selection. A long time ago, someone said “I like this” and they grew more of it and grew more of what they liked from that, and so on.</p>
<p>How did we first decide to eat the painful fruit? I don’t have an answer for that, but my best guess would be: plants evolved aldehydes and such to keep them from being eaten. So with some plants, we would eat and die. No good. But with others, we might only have an unpleasant tingle or “heat” in our mouths. And if you’re hungry enough, where you’re depending on gathering to survive and something is edible but doesn’t kill you, you can opt to eat the lesser spicy fruit.</p>
<p>We don’t all have the same tastebuds and tolerance to spicy foods, but it might be likely for some groups that if they could tolerate it, they could eat more. I’d say nature has favored humans as generalists, for the most part.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are asking two related but different questions.</p>
<p><em>Why do people like eating spicy foods?</em></p>
<p>First, humans taste five flavors: sweet, sour, bitter, salty and umami (savory). Spicy  isn't a flavor. What we call spicy is activation of pain receptors that normally respond to temperature. So I am going to change your question to w<em>hy do people like eating painful foods?</em></p>
<p>You know how on a hot summer day outdoor pools can still be really cold? If you jump in and swim around the water is really cold. So cold it hurts! If you get out of the pool you don't want to go back in, but if you stay in the water you get used to it an the cold water becomes 'fine' and you have good time swimming.</p>
<p>Spicy food is like that. Your first bite feels like you burned your mouth. That's because the same part of your body that responds to heat also responds to spicy food. If you spit it out all you get is the hot feeling, but if you keep eating it eventually your body says hey I should do something to feel better. Your body tells your nerves 'hey, we aren't in actually hurt' let me do something to help you feel less pain. Not just in your mouth but everywhere. It also tells your brain 'hey, don't be so stressed we are fine' let me do something to help you calm down.</p>
<p>Just like jumping into the cold pool is better than slowly wading in, the wanting to keep eating a spicy food after the first bite likely comes from having eaten it in the past. The younger you get spicy foods the more likely you are to eat it when you get older. How young? The spicier a pregnant moms food the more their kids prefer spicy foods as adults. So, that young.</p>
<p><em>Why do people like eating bitter foods?</em></p>
<p>There are 25 variations of bitter tastes buds and depending upon which ones you have it can make foods taste more or less bitter. Most people like some bitter foods but not others.   Some people may not like the taste of whisky but they do like black coffee.</p>
<p>This means that how a grapefruit tastes to me is different than how it tastes to you.</p>
<p>TLDR; we expose kids to spicy foods and the bitter foods their parents are less sensitive to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simple. Those defense mechanisms also prevent mold and bacteria from growing on them so humans  started to use them as a conservative. Eventually we got used to the taste and learned to like it. Because we didn't have refrigerators back then we had to save food in other ways. And it's far more common for spicy foods to exist in hot climates (think India southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa) because food spoiled much faster. So they used more of it. As for temperate climates we still had cold winters and temperate summers so we used other types of preservatives (such as salt and smoking food).</p>
<p>TLDR because food spoils and spice stops that</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
