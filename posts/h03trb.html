When the desire for sleep comes, no matter the timing, it is quickly indulged. But later on in life, sleep becomes complicated by our behaviors and responsibilities. Even today I notice how resting in the middle of the day due to sleepiness sometimes feels better compared to my usual sleeping hours because I force myself to sleep. So would it be healthier to get into bed whenever you're feeling sleepy (assuming you can afford that luxury)?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I know, it is best to have a consistent sleep cycle. There are several different types of cycle. For example, in many Latin countries having a mid day nap is normal  (opposed to sleeping a larger chunk at night). Changing your sleep patterns greatly from day to day is generally not good because your body doesn't have consistent time to rest and repair.
TLDR: Pick a sleep schedule and stick to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had this discussion with a PhD around &quot;sleep science&quot; as I'm a night owl type.</p>
<p>Ultimately the result of the discussion was that living by your natural sleep cycle is best for your health. Forcing people into bad cycles (such as rotating shift schedule) reduces lifespan due to negative impacts on health.</p>
<p>Being a night owl and fighting it your whole life to wake with the early birds may also likely have negative impacts to lifespan as well, though it's not clearly understood how significantly though.</p>
<p>At least this is what I recall from the conversation.</p>
<p>Your sleep preferences are a genetic thing at the end of the day, and you can't easily switch between, but you can adapt with only mild effects.</p>
<p>I say this as I'm struggling to sleep at 3am, being the night owl type.</p>
<p>Need to work tomorrow, at 8am!!!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It would be healthier for people to live by their natural cycle - but society isn't really built in a way that supports it, and thus in order to collaborate with other people, to access shops, to go to work etc, most people aren't given that option - and it is more healthy to be able to eat than it is to starve while ignoring the world around you.</p>
<p>People can train their bodies to get used to the 9-5 cycle - but not everybody can.</p>
<p>A person living by their natural cycle (ie, a nightowl, a morning person, etc) people tend to be more awake and energetic. Conversely, by forcing it to fit into the standard 9-5 model, people who don't fit that model will be more lethargic, at least unless they get used to their required hours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
