		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can address a parcel going anywhere in Latin characters.</p>
<p>Past that, the country code / postal code / street address in nearly any order will eventually get it to where it needs to go.</p>
<p>This is managed by the Universal Postal Union:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Postal_Union" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Postal_Union</a></p>
<p>Mail gets to its destination a bit faster if you format the address as expected by the arrival country, but honestly, as long as all the necessary information is there, it will find a way.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The country name needs to be written in upper case Latin letters. This way any postal service in any country can understand which country to send the letter to. But the rest of the address will not be read until it have arrived at the destination country so it can be written in any way they accept.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ideally you'd address a street in a native alphabet/writing system. Also use destination country postcode format.</p>
<p>With only countries name written in latin alphabet / english.</p>
<p>However Postal service in most countries are very good at delivering things :) There are specialized agencies for handling intrnational letter/packages and they will find the address even if you writ it in Polish</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many countries have a pact with the [Universal Postal Union](<a href="http://www.upu.int/en.html" target="_blank">http://www.upu.int/en.html</a> ), which the country of origin will receive the fees for shipping and the receiving country will absorb the costs to get a letter/package delivered.</p>
<p>UPI also helps other countries and businesses to see how addresses are formated (for example Hong Kong does not have postal codes, but China does, so for many systems, Hong Kong is treated as its own country).</p>
<p>For my job, I use UPI frequently as our system is a legacy system and I have to modify the intent of a field (e.g., add the Mexican/Canadian/Australian state/province after the city instead of in its own field).</p>
<p>Honestly, the trickiest ones are mostly Asian countries and the UK as they crame so much stuff on multiple (usually 3) lines. Our legacy system only has 2 lines and forget it if you try to add the business name.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Figure the US carrier will know enough to get it to the right country, then from there it just looks like regular mail.</p>
<p>Don't know if that's how you're &quot;supposed&quot; to do it, but it's worked for me every time!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
