		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a form of inductive coupling. The phones have a coil of wire, as does the charging pad. When a high frequency alternating current is passed through the wire coil in the charging pad or phone which is providing charge, a magnetic field is created that switches its orientation very quickly. If the phone to be charged is placed very close to this magnetic field, then a voltage will be induced &quot;created&quot; in it's own coil. Add in some fancy rectifying electronics to convert the high frequency induced voltage into a clean and regulated DC voltage, and you've got yourself a wireless charging system!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you put electricity in a wire that’s shaped the right way, it will make a magnet.</p>
<p>If you move a wire (that’s also shaped the right way) near a magnet, the wire will make electricity.</p>
<p>So if you keep turning electricity in one wire on and off, and you put another wire next to it, the second wire will start moving back and forth.</p>
<p>When the second wire starts moving back and forth next to a magnet, electricity comes out.</p>
<p>Because the first wire is becoming a magnet, it doesn’t have to be touching the second wire to move it, but when the second wire moves, it makes electricity. The second wire would be in your phone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called <a href="https://www.makezens.com/wireless-charging-technology/inductive-charging-qi-standard/" target="_blank">Induction Charging</a>, <del>often abbreviated as</del> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi_(standard)" target="_blank"><del>QI</del></a></p>
<p>It works on the same principal as a simple motor/generator, electricity flowing through a wire creates an electro-magnetic field which induces charge in nearby wires.</p>
<p>This effect breaks down with the square of the distance between the wires, so you have to keep them very close together, which is why you can charge something by placing it on the charge-pad, but the charge-pad couldn't induce power in something across the room.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how transformer works? One like in the picture <a href="http://www.animations.physics.unsw.edu.au/jw/transformers.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Two coils on a common core (a thick loop of steel plates). One coil, powered externally, acts as electromagnet generating magnetic field in the core. The other transforms that field back into electricity - either higher voltage, lower current or vice versa, depending on the ratio of number of loops of the coil.</p>
<p>Now cut the transformer's core in half, separating the two coils. Bring the halves together. It's still working, the magnetic field flowing through the gap between the halves of the core - with some losses, but still most of it passes fine. </p>
<p>Same here. One half of the transformer is in the table, the other is in the phone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A transformer is a device where electrical energy is transferred from one coil of wire (the primary) to another (the secondary) without them actually touching. An iron or ferrite core is typically used for guiding the magnetic field between the coils, but it's not required for energy transfer to happen (the transformer then has an &quot;air core&quot;).</p>
<p>A wireless charger has the primary coil inside, your phone has the secondary coil. By putting them together you create an air core transformer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
