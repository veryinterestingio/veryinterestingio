		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A big reason is how they are made. A standard screw driver has a forged tip. You take a round rod head it up to red hot and mash it into the shape you desire. This leaves you with a rod with a tip on it but you can't get much leverage on a narrow round rod so a handle is added.</p>
<p>Hex keys are either milled or more often extruded into shape. Since they are hex shaped and not round all the way through you can get a decent grip on them, add a 90 degree bend on one end and you can get even more leverage and have the choice of high torque or low torque.</p>
<p>What people think of as typical screw head designs also have an issue that internal and external hex head fasteners don't have - the driver will pop out of the fastener unless downward pressure is applied. You need the big handle on a screw driver to keep the driver in the screw. With an allen head screw you don't need to put any downward pressure at all, you just need to apply torque. This is also why you don't see Philips or flat head screws used in applications where there is a need to torque the fasteners down to prevent backing out. You just can't get much torque onto a Philips or flat head screw. An Allen head screw will stay seated on the driver until there is a material failure.</p>
<p>As said elsewhere you can get Allen head screw drivers but they're not popular because there just isn't much need for them. Either it's a low torque application where an Allen key is sufficient or torque matters and something like a socket wrench is better suited.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think backwards, the screw or bolt that is driven by a hex key is usually what’s called a ‘machine screw’ which means it is blunt ended, normally to fasten metal parts together instead of a self-tapping screw (pointy end) that are usually used to fasten into a material like wood or plastic. </p>
<p>Because of their more industrial application, torque (the amount of twisting force, measured in pound-feet/inch, Newton meters, or kilogram meter squared) is more of a principle feature. A Phillips or slotted head commonly found on self-tapping screws are designed to ‘cam out’, where the screwdriver head slips out at high torque. Initially square drive was used to get around this, but the industry went with hex or Allen heads. Trying to apply 50Nm of torque through a screwdriver in a Phillips self-tapping screw is unlikely to happen, but there are many industrial instances where that level of torque, or even more, is required. </p>
<p>How does this relate to the tool itself? Well the need for torque means leverage is more important, having a longer lever makes for more and easier torque. The long side of the L is there to apply either more, or more accurate, torque to the fastener. Having the smaller part of the L means that you can be closer to the head of the fastener and have less chance of rounding it, and works well for confined or harder to reach areas. The industrial environment normally equates to high usage, so the tool will inevitably wear more meaning it will need to be replaced frequently and therefore cost and ease of manufacturing needs to be low. In their basic form, standard hex keys are made from long steel rods formed in a hexagonal shape at different sizes, these are then pushed through a machine at matching size that cuts them at the right length, then they’re heated at one spot and bent, so the manufacturing process is incredibly cheap and easy. This being a key factor for the growth of hex keys during WWII when they became more common and less specialist. You just need to cut and bend metal and you’ve got a tool with built in handle, no need to waste precious materials on plastic handles and such. </p>
<p>There are, of course, many different forms of hex keys available, from standard L, S-shaped, ball-end, short-arm, hex-plus, T-handle (and sliding version), P-handle, screwdriver style, folding sets, and more.</p>
<p>Personally, I wish Torx was more standard than Hex, but that’s another kettle of fish.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, you can buy hex keys in screwdriver form. But, I, for one, enjoy the L shape of the traditional hex key. It gives you &quot;low torque&quot; and &quot;high torque&quot; options, depending on which end of the L you use. That comes in handy.</p>
<p>And I'm sure they're cheaper to manufacture that way, as opposed to molding a handle on one end.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
