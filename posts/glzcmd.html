		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Countries generally do now loan money from each other. They loan money from private individuals, mostly regular citizens in their own country. For example if you have a collage fund or a retirement fund it is likely that these are loaning most of the money to the government. In addition banks will usually loan the money that is deposited in them to the government. This is because the government is considered a very stable payer that always settles its debt when it is due. This is unlike loaning it to individuals or companies who might have problems paying their debt or might go bankrupt at any point. And the government is unlikely to go bankrupt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most national debt is not owed internationally from one nation to another, it is owed by the government to citizens, investors, and many parties.</p>
<p>Governments sell bonds - they say &quot;give us $100 now and we'll give you $102 back next year&quot;. From the government's perspective, selling this bond is essentially borrowing $100 at 2% interest per annum. For the buyer of the bond, this is essentially loaning the government $100 for a year for a 2% per annum return on investment.</p>
<p>The reason national debt is bad is because that $2 is expensive to keep paying. If a country is continually in debt like the US, the government is constantly paying out interest to bond holders - and that's money that could have been spent on public services, healthcare, infrastructure, etc.</p>
<p>Some countries like the US have trapped themselves under massive debt. Many countries have a balanced budget (close to zero debt, where they borrow some years and save other years). Some countries have a large sovereign wealth fund which they can dip into whenever they need money instead of borrowing. The US has trillions of dollars in national debt and there seems to be no talk of balancing the budget on the table politically from anyone as far as I can see. The result is that the government just pays billions in interest every year, instead of spending those billions on public services.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: Governments don't go to each other and ask to borrow money. They sell bonds to investors, citizens, foreign nationals or governments - basically anyone who wants to buy the bonds for a guaranteed return on investment. They don't really owe money to each other, they owe money to a massive different pool of investors.</p>
<p>Edit: Obviously I don't know everything about this subject, just the surface level skim I have provided. Government debt may not be inherently bad, as others have outlined below. As always it's a complex topic that an ELI5 can't cover comprehensively.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't worry if this is confusing- they make it confusing on purpose. When the US for example (though most developed nations use this process too) needs money, the treasury issues a bond which is pretty much just an IOU, which adds to our national debt. most of our debt is to ourselves but a lot of it is also to big countries like China. Anyway those bonds also have interest which is why it keeps growing. The treasury holds a bond auction to the world's biggest banks so they can &quot;buy&quot; some of the debt, so that when it's paid back they can make a profit on the interest as it grows. Then the bankers who bought it do the same process but to the federal reserve. This next part sounds made up but it's true. The federal reserve writes a check for those parts of the national debt out of a bank account with no money in it. They are just creating currency out of thin air. Then that money goes back to the treasury where it's distributed for whatever they needed it for. There is a fictional &quot;debt ceiling&quot; that a lot of politicians talk about, it means they want to stop deficit spending, spending money we don't have, which is what this entire process is. However using this system, it's impossible to  create debt ceiling. As debt keeps rising, so does the currency in circulation, and as the debt and currency cancel eachother out, there's still a ton of interest left over. The system will eventually collapse under its own weight, it just hasn't happened yet. So in short, most of a country's debt is too itself. In fact there's an old quote from one of the founding fathers I think who said something like &quot;Nothing shall be used as money except for gold, for the simple fact that you can't print it&quot;. They knew this could happen!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Countries sell bonds (which are loans) that pay interest (a fee for borrowing money) and are promises to repay the original amount on a certain date. </p>
<p>Countries buy and sell stuff to other countries. </p>
<p>Countries make direct loans to other countries like anybody could go to a bank to do. </p>
<p>Sometimes those other countries end up with a lot of the first country’s currency (like dollars) and when they don’t need to buy stuff with that currency, they buy bonds from the first country so that it can earn interest. China makes billions in US dollars each year and they sometimes use the money to buy US bonds.</p>
<p>Sometimes the first country needs to buy something from other countries and don’t have the money to buy it outright. They borrow what they need and repay the other countries directly. The repayment is on a loan schedule. After World War II, Great Britain borrowed money from the United States. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/28/business/worldbusiness/28iht-nazi.4042453.html" target="_blank">Terms were drawn up and Britain repaid the USA money for decades.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
