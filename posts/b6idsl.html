		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they avoid the local regulations that might easily track where the money came from and who it is going to. Large movements of money say between the USA and Columbia might attract the attention of authorities suspecting that it might be drugs related. However if the money is moved from the USA to the Cayman islands and then from an account in the Cayman islands to another account in the Cayman islands and then to Columbia it becomes impossible to track where the money is going without the cooperation of the authorities in the Cayman islands.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In simple terms it is because the two government don't really talk with each other or verify where the money is coming from and in some cases , the countries do not ask many questions at all.</p>
<p>Its kind of like the old kids trick where they tell two sets of parents they are sleeping over at each other houses but then they go to a party....</p>
<p>Ok so for example lets say I have a bunch of drug money , now I cannot simply put it into my USA bank account as it will be reported and I would have to explain where I got the money.</p>
<p>However if I go to Cyprus and start an &quot;investment/real estate&quot; company, I can deposit the money over there, Now if they ask where I got it I will just tell them I work some job in the USA, or I got it through working in the USA.</p>
<p>So now I have it deposited in the Cyprus bank, I can then with draw it back into the USA and claim that I got the money working or investing in cyprus , Hell I can probably even forge some invoices or documents to give to the USA goverment, and rarely do they bother to confirm with the Cyprus goverment that it is legit and matches what I reported for income there.</p>
<p>So in the end Cyprus thinks my income is legit income I earned in the USA, and the USA now thinks my money is coming from legit income from Cyprus and its hard to get the two governments to actually sit down  and verify my story </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So if you have a checking account in a US bank, odds are it is FDIC Insured.  That means if the bank goes 100% out of business, the Federal Government will cover the losses to your account (up to a limit).  </p>
<p>Generally speaking, if your bank isn't FDIC insured, it's not going to be taken seriously by the public.  Kinda like running an unaccredited medical school offering a Medical Doctorate in &quot;Faith Healing&quot;. </p>
<p>Pretty cool, but it also comes with a ton of rules for the bank.  Basic security requirements, reporting large transactions, filling out some special forms when someone walks in with a briefcase of cash, and compliance with federal orders to freeze the accounts of felons.  </p>
<p>If you're a felon-in-waiting, or a fan of not having someone ask a whole lot of questions when you go to deposit a blood-soaked bodybag full of cash, FDIC banks are not where you want to go. Step one of your prosecution will be freezing all of your assets in US banks so you can't use your illicit money to flee the country or bribe witnesses. </p>
<p>You're better off somewhere with more... libertarian banking philosophies like the Grand Caymans.  If the US Government wants that money, they'll have to go through the Grand Cayman State Department, and they always seem to be too busy to pick up the phone, and the hold music is just a loop of &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAV0XrbEwNc" target="_blank">Fuck You</a>&quot;, because they're an independent country and can do whatever the hell they want.  </p>
<p>This extra trouble is good for the Caymans because it means that Cayman Banks have all that extra cash on hand to use for lending out to businesses and investing towards infrastructure projects on their island that attract more legitimate tourists.  Plus they can charge taxes on the money stored there, because that recording for State Department voicemails isn't free.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically - they are countries that require any investigations from foreign governments to meet a really high bar and take  while. If money laundering - you want to deposit the money in one off shore account and then move it to a second or even third account - since a new warrant will be needed for each account which, with some countries, can take months.</p>
<p>To further obfuscate you want to deposit the money under a shell company (registered company that doesn't do anything other than hide your money). While going off shore is one option, Delaware is another place that has really lax regulations.</p>
<p>Some podcasts you'd find interesting. </p>
<p>Npr's Planet money did an episode on setting up a company in <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/07/27/157499893/episode-390-we-set-up-an-offshore-company-in-a-tax-haven" target="_blank">Belize</a> and Delaware , they then did a <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/09/18/161358307/episode-403-what-can-we-do-with-our-shell-companies" target="_blank">follow up episode</a>. </p>
<p>Recently they sort of revisited the topic, and covered a <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2019/02/13/694549634/episode-418-a-fake-bank-for-money-laundering-run-by-the-government" target="_blank">fake bank </a> the US government set up.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see a lot of drug money responses in here for illegally obtained currency, and wanted to also point to legally obtained currency with tax avoidance.</p>
<p>Lets say you have a mega company. That company is a cyprus based company that is only a name, and the main moneymaking company is a subsidiary of that parent company. The subsidiary can make a bazillion dollars, but a licensing agreement with the parent company forces the subsidiary to pay 100% of all profits to the parent. Because this is pre-tax, you have a transfer of legally obtained money to cyprus because cyprus has lower taxes (much, much lower). All of the bigwig employees (owners, etc) are on the payroll of the parent, while the rest of the organization is an employee of the subsidiary - this causes employees to pay local tax rates, and the owner to pay cyprus tax rates on all earned income because he owns the parent company, and the subsidiary pays zero taxes because all profit is siphoned to the parent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
