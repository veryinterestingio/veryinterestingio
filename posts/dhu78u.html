Some spices even have antimicrobial properties, turmeric for one. Salt is a great preservative, used for thousands of years. Sugar also. Not much can grow in sugar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many of the comments are using the taste or perceived value as an answer which doesn't really address why it tastes good in the first place, so let me give it a try. Spices are a natural defense mechanism of plants to kill any small pests or bacteria that might eat them. The reason they taste so go in the first place is because the concentration isn't enough to harm any large animal like a human, but it will kill harmful bacteria when we eat it. For the same reason, it also makes a great preservative, which is useful in warm climates where ice is hard to come by.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spices are actually fairly expensive even today, when you consider their value by weight. I just did a search on Tahitian Vanilla, which is selling for $45 for 15 beans. That's $3.00 per bean. When you consider how much cheaper travel is now, and how much modern agriculture has enabled us to improve yields, yet these products still command very high prices, by weight, and it's easy to figure out how you could make a lot of profit selling them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Back in the day, you couldn't go to the grocery store for literally anything you want. So certain spices were rare depending on what region you were in. The allure was the money that could be made by traders because rarity = value</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Go cook a meal. Let's do some chicken, green beans, and turnips (no potatoes! Those are american). Dont add salt (edit: I meant while cooking, go ahead and sprinkle some on after it's done-thats what the salt cellar on the table is for), or pepper, or any kind of spice - no nutmeg, mace, cinnamon, nothing. You can use maybe a bit of rosemary but that's about it. When you taste it, how bland it is, you'll understand just how god awful food is without any kind of seasoning. Now think of that every day for your life until someone finally adds a bit of spice. Cinnamon to your apples. Sugar to your cream. Wouldnt you kill someone to eat like that again? Edit: was brought to my attention i listed oregano, which is indeed, an herb. My bad, my point still stands.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
