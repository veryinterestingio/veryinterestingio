The book includes creatures with a standard anus as well those with different butt holes. The best part about the story on NPR was a kid had called in and asked when fish fart, does it make bubbles “like when in the bath?” Kid’s giggling and the NPR folks start laughing and it was so wholesome.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't really get an article for this, but I have witnessed this first hand, and so have many other in the aquarium hobby. Some fish do fart as other people in this thread have mentioned, but not all fish fart for the same reason. A curious, and very funny example is the Genius Corydoras. These fish are incredibly common in the Aquarium Hobby, and you have probably seen them at one time or another. Corys, as we like to call them tend to spend most of their time on the bottom, but occasionally will rush to the surface to gulp some air. This air is not used in respiration, but for digestion. A short while after gulping the air, they will pass it out.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's fairly difficult to believe that anything with an intestinal digestive track doesn't fart, even if the farts are frequent and small (so not explosive). </p>
<p>Farts are caused by the digestion of food in the digestive tract by microorganisms. If there is food in the gut for any length of time, and the gut isn't sterile, there will be gas produced.</p>
<p>Now, it's possible that fish farts are absorbed into the feces. Maybe fish feces are wetter, and therefore better able to dissolve gases. Certainly it's not like diarrhea would be as big a problem for something that has a constant bidet current rolling past the anus... sp wetter fecal matter wouldn't necessarily promote disease.</p>
<p>But unless all the gas is absorbed, there will be farts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
