		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not the jaw, it's the side of the chin.  Applying force there gives you massive leverage on the skull, and the head turns quickly with it.  Your brain isn't attached to the skull, it's freefloating, so the skull impacts it when it turns, and again when it stops.  Your brain don't like being beaten up so it reboots to install adobe updates and you're out.</p>
<p>Hitting just the jaw certainly hurt like hell, but it takes a LOT more force to do the above, and your neck can fight back a lot better (which may not be a good thing)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Force to the jaw is applied to the rest of the skull with leverage. The temples are particularly vulnerable, near where the jaw connects. The leveraged force is then applied to the brain, causing loss of consciousness when bloodflow is disrupted.</p>
<p>Edit: Removed inaccuracies about mouth guards, since strikeout is apparently confusing. There are also issues with the brain against the skull, twisting of the brainstem, etc. See other comments. Not a doctor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To be clear: it’s not. The back of the head directly above the vertebrae is a far better place to strike if needing to knock out an opponent. It is generally more difficult to get to but it is also banned in MMA because not only can blows to the back of the head knock you out they also can cause traumatic brain injuries at a much higher rate than other forms of punching. </p>
<p>In particular the most damaging punch would be what is called a hammer fist, directly to this portion of the skull, because of the leverage able to be generated and the relative weakness at absorbing concussive force this part of the head has.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Jaw Impact</p>
<p>A punch to the jaw causes the head to suddenly spin around. This quick motion of causes trauma to the brain that knocks the recipient out leaving him unconscious. Points on the jaw that are especially vulnerable to knockouts are the sides of the chin, and where the jaw is attaches to the skull.</p>
<p>When the jaw is punched, the head quickly accelerates around. After a fraction of a second, it quickly decelerates as muscles, tendons, and bones prevent the head from spinning any further. The brain inside the skull is floating in fluid 2. It accelerates slower than the rest of the head. This forces it to crash into the inside of the skull when the head stops.</p>
<p>When the brain slams into the inside of the skull, it suffers trauma. It then bounces off the inside of the skull and slams into the opposite side. This causes even more trauma. Depending on the force of the punch, this can happen several times before the brain comes to rest inside the skullTha
a to the brain stimulates an overwhelming number of neurotransmitters to fire at the same time. This essentially overloads the nervous system sending it into a state of temporary paralysis. The person who is hit in the jaw loses consciousness and his muscles relax. The injured person falls to the ground with no memory of being hit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
