<p>You are right in that many DJs perform by 'hitting the play button'. However, there are several other methods to perform live as a DJ as well. </p>
<p>Using Ableton in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj6M_rpDOCk" target="_blank">performance mode</a>, is a popular choice for many DJs and allows you to manipulate which tracks play in real time. For example, the DJ might have isolated vocal mixes and isolated pre-made backing tracks (these isolated tracks are called <em>stems</em>) and might mix and match them to create music in real time. </p>
<p>Another alternative is to play parts on a synthesizer and sampler/drum machine live and record them into a step sequencing machine, which loops the patterns, allowing you to manipulate the sounds on the synthesizer(s) and add layers to the song, a technique demonstrated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE25XQpFW7M" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
<p>Another option is to use a DJ deck in order to mix and match backing tracks and vocals or other instruments, allowing you to create unique mash ups. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmMRIOOABBg" target="_blank">Here is an example of this method in action</a>. </p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong> There are different styles of performing electronic music live and it's entirely dependent on the DJ for whether they want to 'hit the play button' or not. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The vast majority of EDM DJ's use the Pioneer CDJs and mixer that are at the venue – they are essentially digital turntables.</p>
<p>Before a gig, a DJ uses Pioneer's Rekordbox software to analyze all their tracks to get the tempo, key, and cue points they may have set, and then they typically export their set (playlist) onto a USB flash drive. When it's time for the show, they plug the USB into the CDJ/mixer setup, and then they can instantly access all of their music; the equipment allows them to do things like change tempo, sync tracks, apply turntables FX (vinyl stops, etc.), mixer FX (delays, reverbs, etc.), and even beat juggle and scratch if they want to/can.</p>
<p>The advantage of this system is that you: don't need to bring your expensive computer into the booth where it's liable to get stomped on, have drinks spilled on it, or even stolen; there is very little chance of having a software issue – e.g. the computer operating system crashing; if you lose the USB, you can just create a new one; you can store an absurd amount of music – more than any vinyl-vased DJ ever could – on a single USB; and, lastly, when you don't have a computer screen in your face, you can connect with the audience a lot more easily – nothing is less appealing to a crowd than seeing someone up on stage with that glaring white light splashed across their face while they scroll through songs or their email or Twitter feed (yes, this happens ?).</p>
<p>I have met DJs, famous and not famous, who use Ableton to DJ, or just push play; if that's how they want to do things, well, no one is going to stop them, but I, personally, love mixing tracks live without a pre-arranged set. It is just like playing an instrument, and it allows for all sorts of awesome, happy accidents to occur; also, if the crowd isn't feeling a track, it gives you the flexibility to mix out quickly and switch up the vibe. Lastly, it's just more fun; mixing live is challenging, and I would be bored to tears if I were just standing up there while the music played.</p>
<p>I hope that helps! I started on piano when I was 4, and I dropped out of med school to pursue music. I have been Producing/DJing since 2012, and I have played at EDC Las Vegas, Life in Color, Beyond Wonderland, Trapfest, Freaknight, What the Festival?!, Foam Wonderland, and I have been direct support for people like Datsik, Flux Pavilion, Dillon Francis, Antiserum &amp; Mayhem, Blasterjaxx, Herobust, Wuki, Loudpvck, Gladiator, Riff Raff, Lil Debbie, Brillz, Milo &amp; Otis, TJR, 12th Planet, and a bunch of other folks.</p>
<p>I'm happy to answer any other questions regarding behind-the-scenes DJ/Producer stuff; I've seen so much bullshit backstage and at after parties, and it's really obvious who makes their own music and who doesn't, and who knows how to DJ and who doesn't.</p>
<p>The best DJ I have ever seen, still, to this day, is DJ Craze. He is unreal, and I am thankful I got to peek over his shoulder at a sold out show. Mind = blown.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I know I'm late to this post but I hope some people that have the same question as you, see this. There are plenty of &quot;press play&quot; DJs that are more about the spectacle than the music (think Steve Aoki with his cake throwing and crowd innertubing), but there are lots who either still use vinyl or do the equivalent of live mixing, just with digital files instead of records.</p>
<p>But there's a new wave of DJs really trying to step things up and change the game. I'm biased but one of my favorites is Derek Vincent Smith, aka Pretty Lights. He started as a live mixing digital DJ but with a twist, he had a live drummer (Adam Deitsch) for the first few years. He went solo for a while but became bored and really stepped things up.</p>
<p>Here's where the Analog Future band comes in. Derek mixing in the middle, occasionally playing some bass or other instruments. Keyboard. Horn sections. Guitar. All with a crazy light show and being mixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZymzS8ntxZ0" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/ZymzS8ntxZ0</a></p>
<p>Now he's doing something even crazier... On recent tours he's doing an &quot;Episodic Festival&quot; thing and they have improvisational breaks thrown in, even the mixing. </p>
<p>Beyond all that he started the Pretty Lights Music label that has brought us some of the best contemprary names in the game... Gramatik, Michal Menert, Break Science. </p>
<p>Derek is a goddamned musical genius and I fucking hate that Pretty Lights never gets the credit he deserves. Check out some of the Analog Future and Episodic Festival gigs and tell me he isn't singlehandedly changing the game right now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>DJ here.  When it comes to DJs with ACTUAL talent (and there are a lot of hacks in the industry doing the above), it's about using technique (mixing, cutting, scratching) to create one large music piece out of many other music pieces, as well as creating entirely new pieces of music out of elements of others (mash ups).  For example, for a show tonight, im doing a live mash up of an Odesza track with the vocals of &quot;black hole sun.&quot;  I do it live, so i use the decks to manipulate the vocals (using cue points and controlling the speed) and layer it over the track in a coherent and believa ble fashion.  this live mashup is then mixed in from another track, and mixed out into the other track seamlessly.  Coupled with everything else, the point is to tell a story live to the listener that blends and moves seamlessly as if one piece.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work in a mega club, so I feel like I should chime in something. The top comment right now, is right to a certain extent. There is a degree of deconstructing and reconstructing going on. Though a large majority of the time, it is not happening live. A lot of EDM and Dubstep dj's would love to have you believe they're manipulating all this wildness in real-time, but it just isn't happening. </p>
<p>My job was L2, which basically means, I was the back-up lighting guy. I would fix a light if it started to wig out, swap a light out entirely if needed, refill foggers and gazers, operate lights when the main LD wants a break. Many times, I would find myself on stage teching a light next to the dj. Generally, after I would fix them, I would hang low and out of sight for a minute or two behind the dj to make sure it was working fine. </p>
<p>Sometimes while doing this, I would look at what the dj was doing... if you saw two tracks playing at the same time in Serato or Traktor, you knew he was mixing. Although, most, if not all use Auto-Sync these days. Their reasoning is that it sets them up to do more &quot;performance&quot; oriented stuff like a filter sweep. Other times, if you only saw one track playing and the wave form barely moved at all, then you knew that they're just hitting play on a pre-mixed set at home and twiddling knobs to empty channels. I've seen amateurs do this, and I've seen the highest paid &quot;professionals&quot; do this.. My problem with this is, we (the club) are paying you 75,000$ for 3 hours, and you come in with a premixed set and fake everything. On the flip side to that, if you come in with a premixed set but have a video guy and lighting guy that know that set by heart and have content made for it, then that premixed set can be a REALLY awesome experience... Most notably, Paul Van Dyke and Excision.</p>
<p>When I worked there, the idea of premixed sets pissed me off to no end. It jaded me a lot on dj culture and the entire idea of what djs do. But, now that I'm older, I've just learned to ignore and try to have a good time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
