<p>If you notice that you can hear your heartbeat in your ears more and more often, it may be a sign of high blood pressure and would be a good idea to consult with your doctor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because your ears are part of your body. You can actually hear all sorts of noises made by your body, as long as you are in a quiet enough of a place. Otherwise, usually the noise in the environment is too loud.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best way to explain this is to first start with why we hear sound in the first place.</p>
<p>Sound is a translation of vibrations into nervous impulses that get sent to the brain. Strong vibrations transmit faster in solids and slower in gases (this is important for later). However, the intensity of those vibrations impact how well they are heard. </p>
<p>In order to translate those vibrations into sounds, we need way to carry on the message (almost like a game of telephone). That medium is actually a series of 3 bones in the ear connected to each other. When sound vibrations come from the air, they shake the bones (which are solid) and thus carry on the shaking before it dies out. </p>
<p>At some point, the vibration of the bones physically hit something called a hair cell. Note: hair cells are named NOT because they make hair on our skin, but because they have an extrusion(s) that look like tiny hairs. These extrusions are mechanically operated, meaning that once the hairs are physically hit, they open up a bunch communication responses inside the hair cell. That leads to the neighbor of these hair cells, the nerve cells, picking up the signal started by the vibration, and sending it to the brain.</p>
<p>There are millions of signals like this that the brain must filter out to avoid overloading. Therefore the brain will distinguish only the most new, strange, unique, and changing sounds. If a sound is soft and repeats itself enough times, the brain will ignore it (like our own heartbeat). Now if we are in a quiet environment, the amount of ambient (surrounding) noises is not loud enough to overshadow the sound of our heartbeat. Thus we can then hear it. </p>
<p>Finally to be more specific, the heartbeat is audible because the pressure it causes from blood flow is a vibration itself. If the pressure is high enough (or if the ambient noise is low enough), then the vibrations will be detected by the ear bones and will be translated into sound. </p>
<p>TLDR: Sounds are translations of vibrations into electric signals picked up by the brain. Loud, variable vibrations are easily detected. Heartbeats are usually soft and constant, thus not easily detectable. Given a quiet environment or a change in heartbeat, we can hear the heart as it makes vibrations that are translated to sound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually you can hear it all the time. Your brain is just very good at filtering out stuff your sensors are telling it but it has no need for. That's why, for example, you just now became acutely aware of how your tongue is resting in your mouth and how it's touching your teeth and that you are in fact manually breathing and oh, that you have knees and they have been in a weird angle for a while now and you should move them a bit!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a type of rhythmic thumping, pulsing, throbbing, or whooshing only you can hear that is often in time with the heartbeat. Most people with pulsatile tinnitus hear the sound in one ear, though some hear it in both. The sound is the result of turbulent flow in blood vessels in the neck or head. </p>
<p>Most of the time, pulsatile tinnitus is nothing to worry about. If it doesn't go away on its own after a few weeks or becomes really bothersome,Â talk with your doctor about it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
