		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I recently retired from mixing movies and TV shows, and I have to say this: there are extremely strict requirements (laid out by Dolby Laboratories) designed to make the studios where most shows are final-mixed almost identical in response. The problems arise when the cinemas, TV sets, home sound systems, earbuds etc. don’t conform to those requirements, and believe me, they don’t. You know that surround system you saw for $300? It’s the cheapest 6 speakers and crappy amp they could put together and still make a profit on. You know that great old cinema downtown that’s been there for years? The last time anyone checked the sound system was before you were born. The shows sound amazing on the mix stage, the re-recording mixers (the people who do the final balancing) are usually crying when they hear their mixes butchered in the cinema or on some crappy home system with a blown speaker.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most movies &amp; tv shows are written in 5.1 surround sound (five speakers consisting of left, left center, center, right center, right &amp; one subwoofer)</p>
<p>Most home audio systems are 2.0 (a left and a right speaker with no subwoofer)</p>
<p>This typically results in 3.1 (left center, center, right center and subwoofer) getting merged or removed completely. </p>
<p>Most dialogue is down the center (which gets lost) and a lot of action happens on the left and right. This is how you end up with very loud sounding action sequences, and very quiet dialogue.</p>
<p>Many TVs and sound systems offer a &quot;night mode&quot; option, which will try to counteract this. With it enabled, it will limit sections that are loud and keep the dialogue roughly the same. It's not perfect by any means but it will help.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they are usually balanced for home theaters.  That and their audio engineers suck st their jobs. The dialog should be coming from the center speaker which is usually the largest. If it's properly balanced you shouldn't hear a difference. Try switching between sound settings and see if you can tell the difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't help that a lot of the dialogue is whispered/mumbled. </p>
