		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain is always doing things in the background withiut you being aware of it. Every time  you see an object and intuitively understand its shape and size and motion, that's your brain doing a bunch of geometry and pattern recognition in the background.</p>
<p>Psychedelics hugely increase the amount that different parts of the brain talk to each other, which is why people experience things like synesthesia (seeing smells as colours, tasting textures etc).</p>
<p>So one side effect is that psychadelics take those unconscious background processes of your brain, make then talk directly to the conscious parts, and cross wire them into various senses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;In the end, the researchers found a close relationsip between form constants, those geometric patterns regularly observed in altered states of consciousness, and planforms, or the contours of objects seen from above. These results hinged on the &quot;detailed speculation&quot; of lateral connectivity in the visual cortex, brain activity central to our ability to recognize an object, its contours, and how it relates with other objects.&quot;</p>
<p>So based on this and some other stuff i have read and personal experience, i think it has a lot to do with the visual cortex in our brain being very exceptional at finding patterns in things. This helped primitive humans when it came to survival. And drugs like lsd, mescaline, psilocybin etc exemplify that region of the brain.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain is made of a bunch of subsystems who's activity is usually hidden from you. Psychedelics inhibit the part of your brain that hides these from you, the more you take the more of your brain functions are revealed to you. Visual patterns are just one of many consequences this has on your brain.</p>
<p>This whole process is called gating, and psychedelics inhibit process.</p>
<p>Tldr your brain does everything in parallel and normally you only notice one output, psychedelics let you peer behind the curtain to see how the sausage is made.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the more interesting <a href="https://drugsensation.wordpress.com/2011/12/20/eigenfunctions-of-perceptual-processing/" target="_blank">articles</a> I have found on the subject goes as far as to say that the commonness of certain patterns in the psychedelic experience shows that such patterns are part of the eigenfunctions (\~base functions) of perceptual processing in the brain. This is backed up by the fact that entheogen-inspired art throughout human history contains the same general set of patterns.</p>
<p>Even more interesting is this: &quot; These patterns of regularity and spatio-temporal order are not confined  to the visual arts, but extend into every dimension of aesthetic and  functional activity, including music, rhythm, poetry, dance, and  architecture.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
