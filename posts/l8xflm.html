<p>CO2 sublimates at -78 C. Was there CO2 sublimating as solid onto the ground, or even snowing down, at Vostok Station when that happened, and if so, it is plausible that layers of solid CO2 are present at the south pole. Is there any research on this?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sublimation point depends on the concentration of CO2 (specifically, its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_pressure" target="_blank">partial pressure</a>).  CO2 sublimates at -78 C <em>when it makes up 100% of a 1-bar atmosphere</em>.  When the amount of gaseous CO2 is lower, either because it's a small fraction of the gas or because the pressure is lower, the sublimation temperature is lower.</p>
<p>Earth's atmosphere contains about 0.04% CO2 (and rising).  At such low concentration, CO2 will not freeze out unless temperatures are well below <a href="https://www.mistralassociates.com/co2_refrigerant_r744_physical_properties.html" target="_blank">-130 C</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know of any research on this, but I'll argue that CO2 did not and could not deposit on the ground because effects of pressure have not yet been considered properly. The deposition temperature of -78 C is for pure CO2 at 1 bar, whereas the atmosphere is currently about <a href="https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/" target="_blank">415 ppm CO2</a> (and rising alarmingly fast, but not fast enough to affect the answer to this question).</p>
<p>Also, the atmospheric pressure at Vostok Station is a good bit lower than sea-level pressure due to its high elevation at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vostok_Station" target="_blank">3489 m above sea level</a> so the pressure there would be only about 650 mB.</p>
<p>Consequently, the partial pressure of CO2 at Vostok station would only be about 0.3 mB, so the deposition temperature of CO2 there would be well under -100 C. It's actually off the scale on this <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Comparison_carbon_dioxide_water_phase_diagrams.svg" target="_blank">phase diagram</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to ancient data by Siemens, the vapor pressure of solid carbon dioxide is 283 microbar at -89.89 degrees Celsius. Our atmosphere has roughly 400 ppm of CO2. Which is 400 microbar. So in theory, assuming ideal isenthalpic mixing (bad assumption that likely ruins this) and vapor pressure and partial pressure, yes, dry ice could form. But it would be extremely slow. At -90C the vapor pressure of water is about 0.1 microbar. A standard concentration of water vapor in the atmosphere is 25,000 ppm. I’m sure the partial pressure of water in the atmosphere of incredibly cold areas would be enormously lower. But probably not on the order of 250,000 times lower. So if I had to guess (which I do, since I can’t find data on the humidity levels at record low temperatures), the carbon dioxide would probably be precipitating dissolved/mixed with atmospheric humidity in the form of slightly carbonated ice/snow. This means you wouldn’t actually see anything resembling dry ice on the ground.</p>
<p>Is it possible that there’s a layer of dry ice on the ground in an arctic permafrost? Absolutely not. But the ice might have dilute CO2 dissolved in it. More concentrated in the colder regions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For CO2 to sublimate and stay sublimated in significant quantity, the temperature would have to be maintained at below -78C.  As this is the lowest temperature ever recorded, I imagine it's a pretty decent outlier, and that the average temperature would not allow for built up deposits of CO2.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Antarctica" target="_blank">wikipedia page</a> states that this doesn't occur due to the small percentage of CO2 in our atmosphere (~0.04%).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
