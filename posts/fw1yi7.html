		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The full answer is pretty complicated, but the short version is that plants have hormones just like animals. They have growth hormones and the ability to sense light and the direction of gravity. Most plants try to grow towards light and against gravity. Many plants also grow more in the summer because they sense that the days are longer. There have been experiments done with plants kept in similar environments but with different durations of light, and it was found that you can cause certain plants to bloom depending on how long the lights are on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trees communicate using different hormones. These hormones are made by leaves and branches in response to different conditions such as different types of light, temperature, humidity, stress and gravity. These hormones then affect how the other branches grow depending on their genetic encoding. And this determines the shape of the tree. The hormones may also be transfered to different trees either through the air or the roots and therefore shape the entire forest. This is an area of very active research where we study how different plants grow in different conditions and also check what different mutations does to the growth patterns. On of the most exiting new innovation in this work is that the ISS recently got a small greenhouse allowing us to grow plants without the effects of gravity. Not only will this allow us better understand the effect of gravity on plant growth but by removing the effect of gravity we can better see other effects that might be hidden from us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To complete and go more in depth on what was already answered, it is a mix of influences from genetics and environmental conditions (as for everything in biology actually). A stem or a branch usually end with a bud (called apical bud) which contain a special group of cells called a meristem. Meristems are where cell multiplication happens in a plant and so are what allow a plant to grow. During the growth season, this apical meristem will produce new cells at the base of the bud and those cells will then elongate, which will make the branch grow longer. As others said, this process is controlled by hormones (the principal one being called the auxin), and those hormones are strongly sensitive to the environmental conditions. For example, light destroy the auxin, which will make the shadowed side of a stem grow more than the other side and the stem will &quot;go&quot; toward the light source.
Every now and then during this period, the meristem will produce a leaf and on the top of the junction between the leaf and the branch, a little piece of meristem will separate to create a new bud (called axillary bud). This bud will stay dormant until the next growing season (where there is different seasons) and then it will start to be active the same way as the apical bud (it actually is an apical bud at this point) and develop into a new branch. The rhythm and the places the leaves and the axillary buds will be produce is mainly controlled by genetics.
So to summarize, environmental conditions like light (but also wind, gravity, animal grazing,...) control the shape of the branches and where they go, and genetics controls when and where a new branch is produced.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trunk grows up.</p>
<p>Branch comes out a side.</p>
<p>Next branch needs to grow out a different side, to not block light to the first branch.</p>
<p>Next branch again needs to grow out a different angle, to not block light going to first two branches.</p>
<p>So branches need to grow out at an angle that minimises interference with previous branches.</p>
<p>Turns out, the best angle is the golden ratio.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By default, trees want to make branches everywhere, but the top of the tree sends a signal down saying, &quot;no!&quot; As the trunk grows higher, the lower parts of the tree start to have trouble hearing the top and start to grow a branch. That branch turns into a mini-trunk, also saying, &quot;no!&quot; to all the other parts of the tree thinking of making a branch. This keeps happening over and over again. Different trees have louder tips, parts that have better or worse hearing, and parts that eventually decide to stop growing, which is how we get so many different shapes of trees.</p>
<p>Tree top shouting = auxin and other hormones released from meristems.</p>
<p>Rest of the tree = active layers of cells just under the bark / dermis.</p>
<p>Listening = genetic regulatory responses to the auxin / hormones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
