		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good question! Understanding this takes a little anatomical review so bare with me. </p>
<p>So, whether realizing it or not, you are constantly swallowing. Swallowing, while appearing consciously under our control (it is only initially) is actually a deeply ingrained reflex that we learn in the womb and consists of a complicated series of muscular movements from our mouth to the level of the larynx (Adams Apple). This is ignoring esophageal motility after that level. We swallow with food or drink but also all throughout the day/night with saliva.</p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Illu01_head_neck.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a> is a diagram of the pharyngeal structures. </p>
<p>and <a href="https://www.newenglandent.com/images/voice-dysphagia_swallowing.jpg?crc=4014786095" target="_blank">Here</a> is a very simple diagram of the swallowing process. </p>
<p>So as you can see, starting at the level of the Thyroid Cartilage (Adam's Apple), the trachea (breathing tube) is anatomically Anterior (in front) of the Esophagus (eating tube). Above this level there is only one tube, the Pharynx(broken down into Nasopharynx, Oropharynx, and Laryngopharynx). Now, when we swallow, an <em>Incredibly</em> important (and Neat) structure called the the Epiglottis (a Leaf-shaped piece of cartilage and tissue) folds down, sealing off the opening to the trachea(which contains the Vocal Cords/structures), and acts like a little slide to shunt food, saliva, etc. into the esophagus to then go into the stomach. This function is usually incredibly efficient as well as important since any liquid or solid substance getting into the trachea could potentially pass into the lungs. Needless to say, you don't want anything but Air going into your lungs. </p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://kidshealth.org/ES/images/illustrations/fiberlaryngoscopia-399x560-rd1-esIL.gif" target="_blank">Here</a> is a procedure called Laryngoscopy where a Fiberoptic Laryngoscope (camera) is placed through the nose (usually) to get an active view the laryngeal structures. I perform this often for anything from swallowing trouble, sore throat, cancer surveillance, etc. </p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: Real anatomical images incoming</p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iYpDwhpILkQ/hqdefault.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a> is a real image of the larynx that you'd normally see via a laryngoscopy. <a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_H3T9c3zCcFM/TRkAZy0kP1I/AAAAAAAABCc/hvjw3zezlBM/indirect%20laryngoscopic%20view%5B16%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" target="_blank">Here</a> is a nice cartoon image with labels to understand what you're seeing. Its inverted but you get the idea. </p>
<p>Do to the importance of keeping as much non-air substance out of the lungs as possible, the tissue below and around the epiglottis leading into the larynx is incredibly sensitive to irritation. The body recognizes this irritation as something being where its not supposed to be and triggers the cough reflex. Naturally, this consists of powerful expulsion of air from the lungs with the goal of expelling whatever is in there, out either into the esophagus, your mouth, or out of you entirely depending on the force. Even small volumes of liquid getting into the larynx is enough to stimulate this reflex.  </p>
<p>The importance of this reflex cannot be overstated. Disorders of the swallowing process are huge in the field of Otolaryngology(ENT) as any loss of function can lead to serious consequences and drop in quality of life, especially in older and debilitated patients. Trouble swallowing --&gt; aspiration risk --&gt; less eating/drinking and/or aspiration of food/water into the lungs --&gt; weight loss/dehydration or pneumonia/asphyxiation respectively. </p>
<p>TLDR: No it HOPEFULLY doesn't just chill in your lungs as this could lead to serious medical problems like infection, pneumonia, and death. Luckily, the body recognizes the importance of avoiding this and has powerful built-in response mechanisms to help get out anything that may get into the no-go zone. </p>
<p>Hope I did this information justice and in an understandable way. This is of course only skimming the surface of the topic though so let me know if you'd like to know more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, the food rarely gets into the lungs, most of the time it gets lodged in the trachea (the “wind pipe”) or, less often, a bronchus. Second, it doesn’t just “chill” there, your body is actively trying to expel it, which is why you’re coughing.  Third, don’t ever try to suppress a cough because food went “down the wrong pipe,” even if you’re in  public.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your lungs also have a function for anything that can't be immediately coughed up called the mucociliary escalator. It's basically a layer of mucus lining your airways with cilia underneath that slowly push foreign material up to a point where you can cough it out effectively. It's really important for infection control and keeping your lungs healthy. Of course if you aspirate something too large it might need to be professionally removed before it causes an infection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Coughing is a natural reflex to help stop the food from staying there, because most of the lungs are empty space, and the part air flows through is enclosed. The food in there closes into that part, and blocks it up. So the body makes you cough to stir it up and try to force it out of the lung and into the right spot. While this happens, it's also being covered in a layer of mucus to prevent it from harming the lung. It's constantly moving while you cough until it gets out or breaks up enough to move out in pieces.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We tell patients not to eat or drink after midnight, preparing for surgery, for this reason. </p>
<p>We call it “aspiration pneumonia” when stomach contents go in the lungs. </p>
<p>It has 30% mortality. </p>
<p>Under anesthesia, a patient can’t protect his airway bc he’s unconscious—so aspiration pneumonia is high risk for any anesthetic. </p>
<p>That’s why, if a patient tells me he ate/drank, the case is either delayed or cancelled. </p>
<p>No death on my watch!!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
