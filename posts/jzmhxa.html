		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Such fonts are generally &quot;sans serif&quot; fonts, &quot;sans&quot; being the French word for &quot;without&quot;, and &quot;serif&quot; referring to the little pointy bits at the tips of characters in a font like Times New Roman or Georgia.</p>
<p>Take away the serifs and I and l look pretty much identical. On the other hand, with serifs, some fonts will have l and 1 (lowercase L and the number 1) look almost the same, for example, in Times New Roman.</p>
<p>The reason for this is just &quot;because it looks more uniform&quot;. Typefaces are usually designed with a &quot;look&quot; in mind, and a lot of things are done just for consistency.</p>
<p>There are fonts that try to avoid the ambiguity. For example, DIN is a sans serif font, but it has little tails on the lowercase L to distinguish it from the uppercase i. Segoe UI is the current default font in Windows and it (like its predecessor Tahoma) has serifs on the uppercase i, even though it's technically a sans serif font.</p>
<p>You'll also find fonts designed for programmers that, among other things, make their characters as unambiguous as possible, e.g. putting a dot in the number 0 to distinguish it from an uppercase o, in addition to the other tricks mentioned above.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because that's how the letters evolved. Uppercase &quot;I&quot; without the cross bars is a sans serif version. lowercase &quot;L&quot; looks the same with or without serifs.</p>
<p>But if you look VERY closely, many fonts (like the ubiquitous Calibri) actually make the lowercase L slightly <em>taller</em> than the uppercase I. (This might seem counter-intuitive, but that's how it is.) And in at least some cases, your eye can tell the difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why do we do it?</p>
<p>Other people have explained the history of how we got to that point, but the reason why is probably that it mostly works fine. </p>
<p>You're implying with your question that it does not, and for tasks like programming, you're right: it is a disaster. Many type foundries have come out with fonts that attempt to resolve this problem: <a href="https://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/overview" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/overview" target="_blank">https://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/overview</a></a> is one example. </p>
<p>For tasks like extended reading, the placement of these letters in words is going to be immediately tell a reader which one it is. In most typefaces where the I and l are a single vertical stroke, the I is going to be a bit thicker than the l, although on screen, this often becomes difficult to differentiate as it has to render to a grid of pixels. Again, the context is almost certainly going to tell you which is which, making 99.9% of the confusion irrelevant. Of course, we're going to notice those few times when they're hard to tell apart.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr: if it was too big of a problem, we'd stop using fonts like this. It's mostly fine.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it wasn't a consideration when those fonts were designed.</p>
<p>In a normal body of text, you can easily tell which is which just from the context. </p>
<p>We know which words have the letter &quot;L&quot; and which have the letter &quot;i&quot;, and we know that capital letters generally only appear at the beginning of sentences or as the initials of proper nouns.</p>
<p>In my personal experience, telling the two apart only became an issue after computers became ubiquitous and we started using login details that can be any mix of upper and lower case letters every day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
