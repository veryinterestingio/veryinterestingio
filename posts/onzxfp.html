This is fine if you continue the cycle and wake up when the juice runs out, before it can start making more, but if you happen to wake up while theres still sleepy juice in the old noggin, you're fucked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body goes in cycles when you sleep. Get up at the right time in that cycle (easier with a consistent alarm), and you'll feel amazing. Doesn't matter if you got half as much sleep as you need, it's all about timing (less sleep means that wears off faster though, also the cycles repeat each night so multiple chances). When you get too much sleep, you're pretty much always gonna fuck up that pattern and be really tired.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Itâ€™s caused by the breaking of our biological clock cycle. </p>
<p>When your body gets set to sleep and wake up at certain time and one day you break that cycle, your body is still producing all the hormones and shit that makes you sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are different kinds of sleep, called 'stages'. Slow wave sleep is the stage where your body takes care of itself. If you're sick, you need more slow wave sleep. If you work out a lot during the day, or get very hot, you need more of it too. And it's the most important kind of sleep, from a survival perspective. The other stages (like REM, where you do your best dreaming) help you learn things and keep sane, but they don't heal your body the same way.</p>
<p>Now, our bodies evolved a certain way, and one trick that happened was that we evolved to get most of our slow wave sleep in the first half of the night. In fact, an adult past their 30s probably doesn't get much more than half an hour of slow wave sleep in the second half of their night! But they might get 3 hours of it in the first 4 or 5 hours of sleep.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for waking up tired? Well if you sleep 8 hours, you'll get that slow wave sleep early in the night, then spend the rest of the night in 'stage 2' and 'REM' sleep, while your brain does other important work. But REM sleep actually uses up energy. It's a bit tiring, while your brain is cleaning things up in there. And if you keep sleeping, and snoozing, and dreaming, and sleeping, you get more and more REM, but not more slow wave sleep.</p>
<p>So you actually tire yourself out a bit by sleeping! </p>
<p>Interestingly, people who can sleep for more than 10 hours regularly tend to hit another slow wave sleep period after the 10 hour mark. But for the rest of us who aren't long sleepers, we just wake up tired after too much REM.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
