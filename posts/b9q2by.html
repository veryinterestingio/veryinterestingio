<p>Part of your credit score is how much debt you have.  If you are trying to take out a lot of new debt, then you will probably soon be having more of it.  That makes you a poorer credit risk.  Rather than waiting for the credit to actually be granted and then waiting for it to show up in your file (giving you time to game the system), they temporarily ding your credit now when they know you are attempting to become further in debt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You basically nailed it on the head in the first try. It's good for you to shop around, but credit scores aren't for your benefit, credit scores are the things creditors keep to categorize you and they absolutely positively do not want you shopping around for the good rates. A lot about the whole system makes more sense if you remember what the system exists for and who gets the benefit of it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Multiple inquiries within a two week period only count as a single inquiry. However, they penalize you for too many inquiries because they feel if you're constantly applying for credit, you're a higher risk customer.</p>
<p>Generally, people who are responsible with their credit aren't constantly trying to get new credit. It takes &gt;10 &quot;hard pull&quot; inquiries within a 2 year period to really hurt your score, unless it was marginal to begin with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off, your credit score goes up and down based on whatever the rater feels like. They have put in a lot of effort to make their score statistically predictive to the likelihood you will pay back debt, but it is just their models and opinions. </p>
<p>This is why it is so hard to pin down what makes your credit score go up or down. It is because every single credit agency makes up the criteria themselves and they try and keep the public from knowing.</p>
<p>This means we can only guess why a credit agency has decided to cause something to negatively impact your credit score. In this case, it is because the more debt you have, the harder it is for you to pay back all your debt on time. If you are looking for more debt, you are in the process of making yourself less creditworthy. It typically only has a small effect and a short term effect. Typically, you just don't have to worry about it, but if you are looking to get a mortgage loan, it is best to avoid also getting a credit card and a new car at the same time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
