		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was a song written about the Vietnam War during the Vietnam War. It was about the feeling that people were dying for no reason, and the people with money and power could avoid fighting while the poor people couldnâ€™t.<br />
It was a good song, so the people who were against the Vietnam War started playing it a lot.
So it became associated with the Vietnam War then.<br />
I think a lot of our modern association with it comes from its use in Forrest Gump in 1993 though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If you were from a well off family there were many ways to avoid the draft hence the fact that the person in the song isn't a fortunate son.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
