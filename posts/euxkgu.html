		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because we live longer.<br />
Cancer is primarily a disease you get at high age because it can take decades for a tumor to develop into a dangerous and detectable state.  The median age of cancer diagnosed is 66 years. Some cancer can develop quickly but most take a long time.</p>
<p>All humans have to die of something so when we can stop one thing killing you something else will kill you later. We are a good att threatening infection that killed a huge amount of people in the past so not they live longer and have time to develop cancer.</p>
<p>If you in the past died at 60 of infection you could have a  cancer tumor that that had started to develop in you would not be detected. Now  when we can fix the infection you might live to 70 and then you get a cancer diagnosis</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cancer rates prior to the 20th century aren't known, but it's likely they were similar to what they are now. That makes identifying whether or not there has been a noticeable increase since that period difficult to determine.</p>
<p>We're much better at diagnosing cancers than we were even a few decades ago. Prior to that people had cancer all the time, it just wasn't diagnosed and they died under mysterious circumstances.</p>
<p>People would die all the time in the good old days and they never thought twice about it, or did autopsies. </p>
<p>We also live longer on average. The longer you live the greater the chances of you getting some form of cancer.</p>
<p>Also not all cancer will kill you. Your body is able to deal with certain types of cancers to a degree.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many cases of cancer in the past were wrongly diagnosed as something else. &quot;Consumption&quot; for example could have been a whole range of different diseases including lung cancer. It is only recently that we have uncovered what is actually going on in the body and have identified cancer as being a common cause for what were once thought of as many different illnesses.</p>
<p>In addition, many cancers don't appear until late in life. So, in the past, people did not live as long and would have died from something else before cancer took hold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because people were not meant to live as long as they do now. So the cell mechanisms that make sure replications donâ€™t wrong slowly age themselves and our DNA accumulates more and more damage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
