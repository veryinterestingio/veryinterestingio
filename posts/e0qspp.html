		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You pretty much already said it. The music invokes a feeling of power and aggression in your mind, and with the right chord progressions probably also has this sort of sense of building up tension before &quot;releasing&quot; it in a resolving chord.</p>
<p>EDIT: If you wanna see a great example of how chord progression can invoke these sorts of feelings, check out this video by TwosetViolin that puts a comedic take on the concept of emotions invoked by music:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPtd6gVgKo8" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPtd6gVgKo8</a>&amp;</p>
<p>They illustrate Phillip Glass's weird obsession with going from tonic, to sub-dominant, to dominant degrees, but then returning to the tonic 'early'. It basically is the musical equivalent of blue-balling, never really giving the listener a sense of closure as the music doesn't ever seem to resolve.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is also a correlation between feeling sad and listing to “sad” music which actually creates a feeling of elation. </p>
<p>From what I understand the feeling that “someone” out there feels the same way, listening to something that makes you feel understood actually promotes that feeling emotionally to someone who really needs it. </p>
<p>The connections that music can create is worth far more than we really understand </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/teen-angst/201509/the-therapeutic-benefits-extreme-music" target="_blank">This article</a>
from Psychology Today defines &quot;extreme music&quot; as music that is &quot;chaotic, loud, powerful and [has] emotional vocals that contained themes of anger, anxiety, depression, social isolation, and loneliness.&quot; </p>
<p>It explains that extreme music has different effects on people depending on their mental state. People who are in a stable, comfortable position will find extreme music uncomfortable or disturbing, while someone who is going through a period of anger, anxiety, or depression will find it soothing. The article explains that extreme music &quot;provided participants with an outlet to help process their emotions in a healthy manner.&quot;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/why-music-moves-us/201409/4-reasons-we-listen-sad-music-when-were-sad" target="_blank">Psychology Today article</a> cited by u/Fixedentropy explains four reasons why people who are sad listen to sad music. It seems safe to assume, just based on logic and my own experience, that those are the same or very similar reasons for why angry music is calming to someone who is angry, anxious, or depressed.</p>
<p>Those reasons are:</p>
<p>1) Connection. You feel the same thing as the artist did at some point. That makes it seem more normal and manageable.</p>
<p>2) Message. That artist got through it, and went on to succeed, and in fact used it to further their success.</p>
<p>3) High aesthetic value. Music you can relate to gives you a much more appealing distraction from the negatives in real life than music that wouldn't &quot;ring true&quot; to you at that time.</p>
<p>4) Memory trigger. The article points out that using music in this way is actually <em>not</em> helpful in elevating your mood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Board-certified music therapist here. There is a technique music therapists use called the iso principle. It involves meeting the person where they’re at, using music, and gradually shifting the music to help shift their mood or state. For example, if a client is angry or frustrated, I’d come in with some heavy metal or hard rock, or maybe we’d bang on some big drums together, before gradually shifting the energy level. The main concept here is validation. When you’re angry or frustrated, aggressive music feels cathartic because it validates how you feel. It meets you where you’re at.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>there is also something called the Mozart Effect:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozart_effect" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozart\_effect" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozart\_effect</a></a> </p>
<p>which may or may not be true. </p>
<p>But I do custom woodwork for a living, and used to listen to heavy metal/ hard rock.  When I made the switch to classical everything went alot &quot;smoother&quot; , things got less &quot;broke&quot;  and I found myself working more efficiently and accurately.  it also  works with say Latino music.. which I dont understand..  so its essentially classical music with weird fleshy instruments. </p>
<p>just dont listen to country.. you will lose everything you own. :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
