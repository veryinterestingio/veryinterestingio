I assume the shot will basically be a bunch of massively replicated strands of coronavirus spike mRNA... but what are the mechanisms  for immunity to occur? I assume if it were just the RNA itself creating a response, we might be able to use cDNA. Thanks!</p></div></div>

<p>However, it is also true that the mRNA is recognized by the immune system as foreign, and the presence of the mRNA attracts immune system cells to the area around the injection, which ends up making it more likely for them to encounter the viral proteins.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The primary goal is for the mRNA to be transcribed into the target protein, which your body will then recognize as foreign and develop antibodies against.</p>
<p>However, the mRNA itself also aggravates the immune system to a certain extent. This can be useful in drawing the relevant immune cells towards the site of the vaccine injection (in this case the mRNA basically acts as its own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant" target="_blank">Adjuvant</a>. )</p>
<p>However, if the mRNA causes <em>too</em> strong of an immune response it might all be destroyed before your cells can transcribe it into the target protein. This has been one of the roadblocks to effective mRNA vaccines up until recently. Its also part of the reason that the mRNA is packaged inside lipid envelopes (the other reason is to induce your cells to capture and absorb the mRNA, something they don't do for free mRNA molecules).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Foreign RNA can be detected by cells if they are endocytosed. When an endocytic vesicle containing the introduced mRNA merges/becomes an endosome, it is exposed to the TLR3 and TLR7/8 receptors. These receptors bind dsRNA and ssDNA respectively, with their binding sites in the lumen of the endosome. Activation of TLRs kickstarts immune related cascades. TLR7/8 specifically recognizes uridine rich ssRNAs.</p>
<p>Not so coincidentally, one of the key features of the mRNA vaccines is the use of psuedouridine in place of uridine. This helps evade TLR7/8 detection. There's other features that affect endosomal escape and thus subsequent avoidance of TLR activation but thats beyond the scope of your question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not as easy as just mRNA. The Moderna vaccine for example used a vehicle to encapsulate the mRNA to protect it from degradation along with some synthetic components that also have the same effect. </p>
<p>The mRNA is delivered to cells via the lipid nano particle (LNP), which is the main source of toxicity that has to be adjusted. Early clinical data showed that that vehicle alone resulted in ADRs at a higher proportion than just the mRNA. </p>
<p>Once these components were sorted out, the vaccine works by producing the spike protein that elicits an immune response. A successful response recognizes and target the spike protein with an antigen to prevent the spread of a virus from cell to cell</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
