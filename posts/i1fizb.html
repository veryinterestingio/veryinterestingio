		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Census is the scientific term for taking account of a national asset such a population, number of households etc.</p>
<p>There is no one methodology for carrying out a population census. In most developed countries all citizens have social security number and births/deaths are recorded. This type of date gives a lot of insight into population statistics, such a growth pr. generation, fertility rate and more.</p>
<p>In countries where citizens do not have a social security number and where births and deaths are not tracked, a population census will have to do with proxy data.</p>
<p>Proxy data can be other data sources which can serve as a reliable indicator of population information. Such data will not be final and will involve uncertainties. </p>
<p>One common proxy is questionnaires which are distributed not to all households but a representative selection. Questions in such a questionnaire will include, how many people live in a house hold, how many children are born in last year and how many have died.</p>
<p>Another typical source of proxy data is aerial and satellite photography. This data can give an insight into changes in settlements on a larger scale. If a city has grown/diminished can be used to derive amount of people living in a given area and other information.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The technology for counting all the people in a country - a census - has been available for millennia. Almost all countries do regular censuses because it's useful for the government to know how many people are living in the country and (roughly) where they all are. This lets them do things like set budgets, anticipate taxes, distribute political power, and make other important policy decisions. Some countries are moving away from censuses towards administrative records, but they will only do that when coverage of those records is good enough to approximate what a census would have found. </p>
<p>No census is ever completely accurate. They primarily rely on self-reporting and tend to miss people without a fixed place of residence. Countries with fewer resources will generally accept a lower level of quality. They essentially spend as much as they need to in order to get a measure that's &quot;good enough&quot;. Combine all those &quot;good enough&quot; measures together, and the result is probably also &quot;good enough&quot; given that it's actually not that important for us to know how many people exist in the world. Even so, any number you see for the population of the world is definitely wrong. It's just not <em>that</em> wrong. </p>
<p>Could corruption be actively distorting estimates of population? Maybe. As noted above, population counts are important to policy. Politicians from a particular area have an incentive to make that area look as populous as possible in order to get more power/money out of the national government. This is why local governments in the US have been going hard on getting their citizens to participate in the decennial Census. We just have to hope that countries have set up a system for counting the population that is impartial/monitored enough to prevent wild exaggerations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
