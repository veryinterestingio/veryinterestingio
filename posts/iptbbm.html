		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The circuits in your brain that motivate you to do things because you want to accomplish something (positive achievement) are completely different from the circuits that motivate you to do things because you want to avoid punishment or other negative consequences (negative avoidance). When someone tells you to do something you were going to do anyway, the active circuits in your brain flip immediately. You go from being excited about doing something good to being worried about what will happen if you don't. Scientists recently did a study in which this was observed by Functional MRI scans. Unfortunately, I can't find the study at the moment. If someone wants to reply with a link, it would be much appreciated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Psychology professor here.</p>
<p>Two possible explanations for this phenomenon:</p>
<ol>
<li>&quot;Psychological reactance&quot; is when we react to the perception of our freedom/free will being threatened. When someone tells us to do something, we respond by doing the opposite of what was asked or demanded of us to show them that we can do whatever we want, whenever we want. Think of parents telling you not to date a certain someone or hang out with a certain friend--you might find yourself feeling like you want to do it more. If you've heard of the pop-psych term &quot;reverse psychology,&quot; it's an attempt to exploit psychological reactance. If I want you to do X, I can tell you to NOT do X in the hopes that reactance kicks in, resulting in you doing X to show me you're an adult with free will. In the end, I got you to do X.</li>
<li>You can think of behaviors as being motivated either internally (intrinsically) or externally (e.g., money or recognition). If you are about to go do something, it's probably because you wanted to, so you were internally motivated. When someone else tells you to do it, that action has become externally motivated, making you feel like now you're only doing it because you were told to. External motivations can suck the intrinsic reward out of behaviors. Ask anyone who has volunteered as a hobby, say at a soup kitchen. They engaged in this behavior regularly because they enjoyed it and it felt good. If that hobby ever became a job where they got paid to work at the soup kitchen (now an externally motivated behavior), that person would likely enjoy it less, feel less motivated to go to work, get less fulfillment out of it, and so on. Find a kid who genuinely enjoys coloring in coloring books. Then tell her that she has to color in the coloring book every day as homework. You'll find her coloring significantly less often.</li>
