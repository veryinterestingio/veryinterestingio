<p>Will the ant eat the food to survive? Can it detect a way to make it back even though it may  take weeks? Will it just wonder around and die, or will it adopt a new colony?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the subspecies. Some ants, unsurprisingly the widespread and successful ones, can and will start a new colony if a few get separated from their old home. Some ants can even become queens and start laying eggs.</p>
<p>Some ant subspecies will build new tunnels and start bringing resources there, working like they did in their previous colony.</p>
<p>But not all ants can do those things. Many will just walk around looking for their colony until they die. With no chemical trail or landmarks to follow they search in vain until they die since they have no other purpose or goal in life. They mainly just join forces and wander around looking for a chemical trail, ironically leaving a trail themselves so they may get stuck in a loop and walk in circles until they die of exhaustion. There's a name for that phenomenon: an ant mill.</p>
<p>That said, ants generally aren't strong enough to protect themselves away from their army and they don't live for more than a couple of months (apart from queens that can live for decades) so they may not have much time to build or search in a new environment anyway, especially since ants from other colonies tend to be very aggressive with strangers</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One certain thing is that they will not adopt a new colony. Ants recognize the pheromones of other colonies, even of the same subspecies, as &quot;enemy&quot;. Any other ant colonies are one of the many dangers that they will face.</p>
<p>However, if it is a group of them, many types of ants can form a temporary colony even without a queen. That is why &quot;ant farms&quot;, which have no queen, work. The group, lacking a clear path back to their colony, after windmilling for a little while, may begin digging a new one, and just will not have a new generation to replace them when they die.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Come join us, we gots loads of jobs on the go and you'd fit right in...' or would it be more like: 'Outsider! Imposter! Tear him apart for food.
