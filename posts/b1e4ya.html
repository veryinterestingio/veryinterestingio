		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A roadway is placed on top of compacted soils. Those soils are usually only tested for proper compaction once per 100 linear feet.
Usually the technician testing the soil chooses a relatively compacted ( dense) area to test so they get a passing number.
After the soil’s are compacted they place rebar and concrete on top of the soils.
Once cars are driving on the roadway they cause vibrations that carry through the concrete and into the soil beneath.
Those vibratios, after a while,  cause The soils to subside in some areas once subsidence occurs the weight of the concrete does the rest.
Gravity pulls the concrete down to fill the hole left by the soil and voilà a pothole is created!</p>
<p>To remedy this problem a contractor will usually remove a workable section around the pothole (usually 3 to 4 ft.² around the pothole) they will remove the soil and replace it. Have a technician tested for proper compaction and then they place the rebar and concrete back on top.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Engineer here, causes can vary:</p>
<ul>
<li>gelivity is the most common (water enters into the asphalt/concrete through cracks, freezes up and increases its volume thus forming bigger cracks =&gt; over many cycles this leads to a cavity)</li>
<li>poor setting conditions for the asphalt/concrete mix (humidity and temperature greately affect how the mixture hardens - if you ever see roadworks being done in the rain or immediately after, or when it’s really cold outside, then expect repair works also)</li>
<li>improper compacting and layering (in order to build a road you need to create several layers that need to be properly compacted and leveled so that the final product does not sag or settle under traffic loads)</li>
<li>heavy traffic conditions (the type of mixture and number of layers varies depending on the amount of traffic that road will need to sustain - abnormal increases will lead to fatigue and failure)</li>
<li>broken water mains or improper rainwater drainage can wash away and erode the lower layers of ground under the road leading to sinkholes in the road</li>
</ul>
<p>...can’t think of anything else</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's amazing what origins are lost in time.  I learnt this from an antique English dictionary, and it tickled me so much I've never forgotten:</p>
<p>In bends of old unsealed roads, wooden wheels would run over the same spot, as wagons and carriages turned the corner.   They would churn up the road clay with rainwater, and locals would dig out the softened clay which was easier than gathering and working dry hard clay, and then make their pots from it.  Literally, pot-holes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Potholes form when water gets into cracks in the road surface and freezes at night. When water freezes, it expands. This pushes the crack wider and wider until passing cars knock pieces out. </p>
<p>Potholes can form in the fall or spring but are more likely in the spring. The snow accumulation over winter is a constant source of water that melts during the day and flows into the cracks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
