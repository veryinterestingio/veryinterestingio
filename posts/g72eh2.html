		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As another poster said, Hydrogen at that temperatures is in a state of mater known as plasma. Plasma is electrically conducting due to free electrons. So from a materials perspective, the Sun being able to produce a magnetic field is not overly surprising. What is surprising is that a dynamo action can actually happen in the sun. Why? This is because you need specific conditions to cause dynamo action, one of those is strong shear flows. A common source of shear flows (the most common) is when you have fluid interacting with a solid boundary. The Sun has no such boundary since it is a giant ball of plasma. The shear instead comes from a transition region between the convective envelope and the radiative core, known as the tachocline. Essentially this region exists because the convective envelope is differentially rotating while the radiative core rotates as a solid body. (this is at least the leading idea of where the magnetic field is generated in the Sun).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, the core being iron has nothing to do with the earth's magnetic field. The iron and nickel in the core are WAY BEYOND the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curie_temperature" target="_blank">Curie temperature</a> to be magnetic. It is the rotation of the core (a hot conductive liquid) that give rise to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo_theory" target="_blank">geodynamo</a>.</p>
<p>The electrically conductive plasma of the solar core, that rotates at a different rate than the outer parts and gives rise to a <a href="https://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/dynamo.shtml" target="_blank">solar dynamo</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lightning can discharge voltage through air, even though it is an insulator, because the heat produced by the initial connection superheats the air into a state of plasma - plasma, no matter which matter, is extremely conductive and carries charges around when moved, like via convection inside the sun. This movement creates a giant electromagnet.</p>
<p>Since convection inside the sun is a bit chaotic, this also does not create a simple looking magnetic field like you'd see in a physics book showing different magnet builds like a rod or horseshoe magnet, but twisted and creating arching loops of high field strength that can rise out of the sun's surface, even, and carry hot plasma along outward!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
