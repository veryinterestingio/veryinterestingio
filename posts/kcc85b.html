		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Food science student here. Not all sodium is salty. In prepared foods the bulk of the sodium will be from preservatives; the rest for flavoring. When you're cooking at home you're only adding one type of sodium (NaCl) and only for flavoring. The average american does not get the bulk of their sodium from table salt.</p>
<p>A person could go on a heart-healthy diet and eat the recommended daily foods but still be consuming 2x or 3x the DRI for sodium just by eating prepared foods rather than home cooking.</p>
<p>Although commercial style sodium ingredients don't taste like table salt they do have their own flavor. If you grew up eating packaged food you may not taste it. For the sake of argument if you exclusively cooked every single thing you ate then after a while you'd probably be able to taste it.</p>
<p>Edit: Holy schnikes thanks for all the gold, this was an efficient way of procrastinating on my thesis. </p>
<p>-Somebody mentioned the &quot;bliss point&quot; of balancing lots of sugar with salt. Though I think that does play a role, mostly in R&amp;D, it's important to remember that food companies want to save money. They will be using the least amount of resources possible to reach quality and safety standards. The consumption of sugar the US is actually going down! </p>
<p>-Sodium nitrate was also brought up. It is the key ingredient in cured meats (bacon, prosciutto, etc). It keeps the botulism out of your food which is an odorless tasteless killer. Prior to sodium nitrate we used potassium nitrate (saltpeter) which produced inconsistent results (aka death). Nitrates have been used since antiquity! They have a bad rap because when eaten in excess they're correlated with cancer. There are many products on the market now that market themselves as &quot;uncured&quot; but this is misleading. They are still cured via nitrates thru different ingredients (celery) </p>
<p>-Sodium is an important part of a healthy diet. There really are no evil foods! The best advice for a healthy diet is a rather boring one: eat balanced. Despite how un-sexy it is really the best dietary advice for the average Joe is from the <a href="https://www.choosemyplate.gov/eathealthy/dietary-guidelines" target="_blank">USDA</a>. When in doubt, read the labels!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people here aren't correct- the amount of table salt (NaCl) would taste bad in either. Processed foods do tend to be saltier, but what you are seeing is the Sodium. Almost all Sodium in home cooked meals comes from table salt. In processed foods Sodium can come from other sources such as the preservative Sodium Nitrate. Sodium Nitrate is also technically a salt, but not your table salt.</p>
<p>Edit: I mixed up Sodium Nitrate NaN03 with Na3N which isn't stable. People pointed that out correctly. Also as someone else pointed out there are tons of sodium compounds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because &quot;salt&quot; is a broad term. Table salt is sodium chloride (the one you add if you cook) but company may add other salts like potassium chloride which taste differently. Its still salt and it's still bad for your kidneys in large quantities.</p>
<p>EDIT: also, mixing salt with sugar or starch in the right proportions reduces the taste!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They add sugar and salt until they reach what's called the bliss point. The sugar is what makes the salt taste good in those large quantities. </p>
<p>Also, the salt is mixed in with the food well before purchase, which allows the salt to get into the plant or animal cells or otherwise into the foods chemical matrix as opposed to being on the surface of the food or in solution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Checking in with another semi-relevant point. I’ve recently made a big effort to reduce my sodium sodium intake for cardiac reasons. My awareness has skyrocketed of the sodium content in almost everything outside the produce section of the market. To me, it seems like our country has a “silent sodium crisis” that contributes to our heart disease epidemic, but doesn’t yet get the same level of attention as fat and sugar. Stepping down from the soapbox now!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
