		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When it comes to some animals like whales, dolphins, orca and the like, separated by 500 years they would most likely not be able to communicate well with each other, they have regional dialects just like us. I wouldn't be surprised if the same applied to elephants but I'm not certain how complex their &quot;language&quot; is compared to the ones of the killer whales. </p>
<p>There is another interesting thing concerning killer whales, they have been shown to be able to learn the &quot;phrases&quot; from other dolphin species vocabulary, though to which extent that can occur is not really known.</p>
<p>Lion communications are far more simple. I think they are pretty universal going back a few thousand years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, a distinction needs to be made between language and communication, the two are not interchangeable. </p>
<p>Language is a complex form of communication in which users can lie, talk about things in the past or in the future, express abstract ideas, and express experiences one has never felt first-hand. </p>
<p>Communication can be any one of those, but not all together. Most if not every animal posseses at least one of those capabilities, but never all, thus no animal other than humans can use a language. </p>
<p>Now, as others have stated, animals like whales often have regional patterns to their songs, as do some species of birds. Ants use different chemicals to communicate different things, and these chemicals can slightly differ from one colony to the next even in the same species. So in short, there are some animals that'd have a hard time communicating with the same species from 500 years ago, but others would be unaffected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unless we're talking about developing things like different vocal ranges (see - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52-hertz_whale" target="_blank">52-Hz Whale</a>) or different means of communication through mutation / evolution, there shouldn't be a reason animals shouldn't be able to communicate, or learn to communicate at least.</p>
<p>Same would work with humans - while you might not understand someone who lived 500 years right off the bat, over time you could learn one another's language and possibly develop a shared dialect. It's not much different when you meet someone from a different country.</p>
<p>So initially those animals might get the basic, universal concepts across (&quot;I'm angry, hiss&quot;), and over time learn to communicate together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Animals don't have language in the sense that humans do.  Human language is symbolic...it can represent any meaning with an arbitrary set of sounds.  On the other other hand, animal communication works more like human body language.  A lion would certainly be able to know another lion was angry, or in heat, or protecting its territory, no matter how much time had passed, as long as it was interacting with another animal of the same species.  And probably with others of similar species too.  </p>
<p>Now, there are some limited exceptions to this.  Some animals use a variety of alarm calls indicate specific predators.  Sometimes these can be culturally transmitted, so it's possible an alarm call from two individuals separated by time could be misinterpreted.  You also get cultural variation in mating songs.  This is what happens with humpback whales and a variety of birds.  So an ancient bird or whale might not be up on the most attractive song variations.  And some species, like various dolphins, use calls to identify specific groups.  And an ancient individual probably wouldn't be able to easily join in with such a group.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
