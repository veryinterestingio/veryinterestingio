		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All organs. Literally everything in your body is constantly producing heat.</p>
<p>Your body gets energy from food and oxygen. In that process, heat is produced. It's a 'by-product' of any activity, but is very useful for staying at the right temperature. Every part of your body constantly needs to do stuff to stay alive, so every part of your body is producing heat constantly as well.</p>
<p>When your body doesn't produce enough heat from normal processes it will produce extra heat by activating muscles. Those muscles will need energy for movement and produce heat in the process of getting that energy from food produce heat. This is why you shiver when you're cold: to activate your muscles to produce heat.</p>
<p>Normally you produce about 80 watts of energy. That can increase during exercise to about 1000 watt for short periods of time. Elite athletes can produce somewhat about 400 watts for long periods of time. A lot of this energy is converted to heat.</p>
<p>Edit: these numbers are mechanical energy, e.g. the amount of energy required to move you up a mountain. The actual heat production is even higher, since we're not very efficient when it comes to producing mechanical energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the top answers here are incorrect. They are focusing on organs that produce the most heat per mass, but that doesn't actually account for the majority of heat production in your body. By far the most total heat comes from muscle tissue. While muscle tissue may produce less heat/gram compared to things like brown adipose or liver, you have 10x or more the amount of skeletal muscle tissue as any other heat producing organ. Several of the chemical reactions that are responsible for muscle contraction (which your muscles are doing constantly, even at rest) are exothermic. That heat is then radiated to the environment through your skin or throughout the rest of your body through circulating blood. The reason that babies have so much more brown adipose tissue is because they don't have as much muscle mass nor have they developed as much resting muscle tonicity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised that no-one mentioned the liver yet, which I learnt was the most important heat generator:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of the heat produced in the body is generated in the  deep  organs,  especially  in  the  liver,  brain,  and heart, and in the skeletal muscles during exercise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Textbook of Medical Physiology, page 890; from 2005]</p>
<p>But the answers with <em>Brown fat tissue</em> seems to have a point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brown fat is a major site of nonshivering thermogenesis, but other tissues, notably muscle and liver, can contribute tocold adaptation.</p>
</blockquote>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As many others have said, many many cells in the body have mitochondria which pump protons out of their matrices, and let them slip back in through ATPsynthase (to turn it like a turnstile which creates ATP from ADP + P). This process is not 100% efficient and some kinetic energy is dissipated as heat.</p>
<p>What is EVEN COOLER though, is that the body can purposefully create more heat (eg to generate a fever) by allowing the protons back into the mitochondrial matrix via uncoupling proteins (UCP-1 in particular), which basically is like an impotent ATPsynthase - no ATP is generated, but much more of the kinetic energy is lost as heat. </p>
<p>Other sources of heat are extrinsic to the cellular processes and are kinetic energy caused by muscles moving. For example, shivering creates heat this way.<br />
Would recommend looking up brown adipose tissue (as others have suggested), and thinking about your body as lots of tiny moving parts - friction and cellular processes both output heat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
