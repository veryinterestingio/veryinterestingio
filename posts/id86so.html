		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Join us today as we answer questions about ocean worlds: planets and moons in our solar system, and in other star systems, that have liquid water oceans. These are intriguing places to study, because Earth has taught us to &quot;follow the water&quot; when searching for life in the galaxy. On our planet, water is crucial to life. </p>
<p>We're learning that ocean worlds could be ubiquitous in the galaxy. Just in our solar system, we have found evidence of oceans on Saturn's moons Titan and Enceladus; Jupiter's moons Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto; Neptune's moon Triton; and on Pluto. We also believe that Venus and Mars may have had oceans billions of years ago. Could they have supported life? Ask us about ocean worlds, what mysteries we're working to solve, and which ones we're going to next.</p>
<p>We are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Carrie Andersen</strong> - planetary astronomer - research focus on the ocean worlds, Titan and Enceladus.</li>
<li><strong>Giada Arney</strong> - planetary scientist and astrobiologist who studies habitable exoplanets and whether Venus could have been an ocean world.</li>
<li><strong>Lucas Paganini</strong> - planetary scientist at NASA Headquarters who specializes in icy moons, comets, and planetary atmospheres.</li>
<li><strong>Avi Mandell</strong> - exoplanetary scientist and astrobiologist who observes and models exoplanets around nearby stars.</li>
<li><strong>Melissa Trainer</strong> - planetary scientist who is deputy principal investigator of the Dragonfly mission to Titan. Studies organic synthesis and processing on Titan.</li>
<li><strong>Kira Olsen</strong> - geophysicist who studies icequakes and the icy shells of ocean worlds.</li>
<li><strong>Joe Renaud</strong> - planetary scientist who studies tidal dynamics and tidal heating in solar system moons and in exoplanets. </li>
</ul>
<p>We are available from 2pm - 4pm ET (14-16 UT), ask us anything!</p>
