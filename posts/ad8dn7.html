		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s incredibly easy to forget the memory of what we experienced whilst sleeping without trying, but a regular memory wouldn’t fade the same way. Both types of memory seem accessible within the subconscious mind, because when we engage in future events we can have things jog our memory spontaneously and help us recall them both. So why is one so much more difficult to consciously hold on to?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not known for certain why we usually don't remember dreams. The leading hypotheses seem to currently revolve around the brain shutting down its long-term memory facilities during sleep. The hippocampus, responsible for sorting and encoding memories into long-term storage, seems to stop accepting new memories during sleep. In addition, certain neurotransmitters associated with memory formation drop off rapidly in sleep.</p>
<p>So this is perhaps the chemical reason why we don't remember. There may be an evolutionary advantage to this in that remembering dreams could lead to confusing experiences. Dreams are sometimes thought to be the result of the brain sorting through experiences and figuring out how to tie them together. This can lead to nonsensical results, as anyone who remembers even fragments of dreams knows. If these nonsensical results were remembered, they might get cycled into the real memories and the wrong lessons could get added to long-term memory. Those wrong lessons could shorten the person's life, and if that happens before they can reproduce, the odds of dream recollection drop off.</p>
<p>Some people can remember their dreams vividly for a day or so, until they also and the hippocampus tosses them. Most people have a few they remember pretty well (I have one from my childhood of watching the moon explode, dodging the fragments, and getting into a hundred-foot tank that rumbled by). A few people regularly remember their dreams and can recall them like they recall their lives.</p>
<p>This isn't always a good thing: some of them can't separate dream memories from reality memories, and it can make it extremely difficult to get through life not sure which conversations actually happened, to say nothing remembering going somewhere you didn't or even thinking you experienced a traumatic event that never happened. I've heard that it can lead to mental breakdowns.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think about those times you were at class,but instead of focusing on the lesson you were browsing Reddit half of the time. Chances are, on the lesson you figured you got most of it. However, when homework hits, you notice you don't remember shit. Or if I asked you, what colour shoes I had the day before yesterday, would you recall? Point being, when you aren't specifically concentrating on something, your mind usually just dismisses it as unnecessary.</p>
<p>Therefore when you wake up, unless you specifically try to put the dream to your long term memory when you wake up, your brain will probably just discard it as unnecessary.</p>
<p>Do note, not an expert on the matter, so grains of salt and such.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you are awake and alert, your brain makes memories by building connections between different things, smells, sights, sounds, etc. these connections allow you to remember  things associated with the thing that reminds you of them. </p>
<p>When you sleep, your mind is cycling through unconnected memories, but not creating new connections. This is why crazy things seem perfectly normal in a dream, but then you forget all about it after you wake up. No new connections were made.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you can realize that you were dreaming, and some of those crazy things are still in short term memory. If they were powerful enough, you can make a connection between them and your dreams, but you wont remember all the details. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the theories about dreaming is that it's just a biproduct of memory consolidation. While you are sleeping you brain is pruning out unnecessary memories and reinforcing the important ones from the day. But our mind doesn't like random stuff so it tries to build a narrative to follow along with the memories.
We probably don't remember dreams because there is no reason to, unless you try to. They are just your minds way of making sense of the chaos. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well when we dream we are in our subconscious, and unless the experience is very emotional (good or bad), you probably won’t remember it.</p>
<p>With that said, since you’re only in your subconscious for a portion of sleep, it’s easy to forget, or not even remember at all.</p>
<p>They say we always dream, but I haven’t had a dream in a while. I chalk it up to the jazz cabbage</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
