		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/living-emotional-intensity/201810/depersonalisation-why-do-i-feel-empty-and-numb%3famp" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/living-emotional-intensity/201810/depersonalisation-why-do-i-feel-empty-and-numb%3famp</a></p>
<p>I’m assuming this is akin to what you’re referring to. Basically it’s a defense mechanism. When the news is bad enough and you can’t process it without losing your sanity to some degree you’re emotions basically shut down and remove you from the experience to protect you from it. That’s in part why people often talk about feeling like they’re being run on autopilot when that kind of stuff happens. </p>
<p>As for the physiological process underlying depersonalization, that actually isn’t well understood. Some people are more susceptible to it than others, and we know that it can result from heightened states of stress and fear but what causes it directly isn’t known and so we don’t really know why it happens to some people and not others. </p>
<p>Hopefully someone better trained then I can answer this. But let me know if this was what you were asking about, if not then please clarify for me that I might answer it better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your gut uses a lot of resources. Between digestion, management, and exchanging nutrients, the area has a very high traffic of bloodflow.</p>
<p>The rest of your body also gets the stuff if needs to do things from the blood. To help conserve resources, the body does most of its gut-stuff while asleep (which is why many people poop in the morning). However, the gut does still get a lot of blood while you are awake.</p>
<p>When something triggers a stress response, your body wants resources in other places. Your body wants to supercharge those arms for punching, those legs for running, and that brain for processing sensory information. In order to supercharge those other areas, the body diverts blood from the gut. Digestion is a much lower priority than not getting digested.</p>
<p>That's why you feel cold and hollow. Your gut, the part of you that is normally full and warm, has less of the blood that makes it feel that way.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our brains haven't quite adapted to social stresses because they are a relatively new invention. Our brain hasn't quite figured out the difference between the different kinds of stresses. Your brain handles bad news in the same way it handles rustling grass; it gets ready to run or fight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When people feel emotional pain, the same areas of the brain get activated as when people feel physical pain. </p>
<p>This triggers the release of stress hormones (cortisol and adrenaline), which leads to physical symptoms, such as nausea, difficulty breathing, and also a weakening of the heart muscle that doctors called Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.</p>
<p>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is also known as stress cardiomyopathy, which there is a sudden temporary weakening of the muscular portion of the heart. This weakening may be triggered by emotional stress, such as the death of a loved one, a break-up, rejection from a partner or constant anxiety.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I had this empty feeling with some very bad news it gave me the capability to act really rational
As posted before it probably has to do with a fight/flee/freeze reaction. If your emotions are empty you probably have a better chance in making a rational decision on how to react in that situation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Look up the vagus nerve, new research is showing just how tied to the brain it is. Like the butterflies in the stomach feeling comes from that, also when you have a gut feeling about something, that's legit. Always trust your gut. And for those who posted about the general numbness in feelings, look up ANS dysfunction and the Nemechek protocol. I only learned about it because my kids were a hot mess of delayed speech, ADHD, ASD and anxiety. I learned everything I could about ANS dysfunction and was amazed. Basically from past traumas I'd slowly turned into an emotional zombie. Things are much better now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
