		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This video was taken on <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Long+Island/@23.1811792,-75.1717779,12401m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x8933f0a4bde71d17:0x26ac68abe088712e!8m2!3d23.1764239!4d-75.0961549" target="_blank">Long Island, Bahamas</a>, which has a very large but shallow inlet which connects to the ocean in the west. This footage is likely from that area, which you can see in the link above has many docks similar to the one seen in the video. Since it had a strong, persistent easterly wind for close to 24 hours, this was enough to lower the water level by several feet, turning a good portion of the lagoon into dry land.</p>
<p>Edit: also to answer your second question, &quot;In what manner will it return&quot;, it already did, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/6z2zfl/can_anyone_describe_what_is_happening_in_this/" target="_blank">according to one of the original video posters</a>.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Another meteorologist <a href="https://twitter.com/wxbrad/status/906719579099070465/photo/1" target="_blank">posted this helpful diagram on Twitter</a> showing the geometry of the bay and the wind direction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Basically, Hurricane Irma is so strong and its pressure is so low, it’s sucking water from its surroundings into the core of the storm.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>In any case, this isn’t the sign of a tsunami. The water will return to Long Island, and it probably won’t rush back with any great force. It will probably be back by Sunday afternoon.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok I'll take a crack at this. Imagine you have a bathtub full of water. Submerge a standard 20 ounce cup and lift it out the water upside down. You'll lower the water very little in the tub as it's now sucked up in a glass above the surface. Let's assume that's a category 1. Now do the same thing with a five gallon bucket. That's our category 5. So due to forces in the storm low pressure, wind and what not there's a column of water higher then the normal level in the center of the storm. The water has to come from somewhere so it's lower in the video and higher in the storm. Once the storms influence passes the water will flow back to its normal level. How'd I do? ?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The hurricane is a massive low air pressure area.  Elswhere the air pressure is normal.   The different levels of pressure pushing down on the water surface will cause the water level to rise under the storm.  That water has to come from the outside areas.  Additional factors come into play as that &quot;hump&quot; moves into shallow waters, emphasising the differential.  As the storm dissipates the levels will gradually equalize again. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because the strongest winds of Irma are in its northeast quadrant, and are blowing water away from the region offshore of the Bahamas.  In effect the winds are piling up water ahead of them, leaving a depression where the waters are blown from.  This sucks in the surrounding waters, especially noticeable in the Bahamas which is a very shallow, broad submerged area in the direction of Irma.</p>
<p>Contrary to what others are saying here, it's <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/surge/" target="_blank"><em>mostly not the result of the low air pressure of the storm itself.</em></a>  Pressure drops result in about 5% of the surge of a powerful hurricane, and that would be directly under the eye.  Wind surge affects a much larger area and much greater height.</p>
<p>This makes sense if you do a back of the envelope calculation: One inch of mercury of pressure difference is about 13 inches of water. The center of a strong hurricane may be <del>two</del> three inches of mercury lower pressure, e.g. ~27 vs <del>~29</del> ~30, which converts to around three feet of water difference. So the sea level difference due to pressure is negligible- at most a bit over <del>2</del> 3 feet vs a total of 30 feet or whatever from a strong surge.  </p>
<p>In this case the effect of the wind-driven storm surge leaving land high and dry is exacerbated by the shallow shelf area that the Bahamas rest on.</p>
<p>Edit: Normal atmospheric pressure is closer to 30 not 29 inHg, so adjusted my numbers.  Also, <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/hurricane/surge_world_records.asp" target="_blank">storm surge can be up to 50 feet, although such large surges depend on the interaction with seafloor and land topography</a>. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
