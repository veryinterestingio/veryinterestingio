		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What are you thoughts on leveling the playing field by mandating medical entities follow the law when it comes to transparency with regards to pricing. Or enacting such governance as:</p>
<ul>
<li>100% publicly visible pricing</li>
<li>Disclosures of actual price to be charged for each event prior to service and signed by both parties</li>
<li>Non-billable events: events caused by poor treatment (e.g. MRSA as a result of surgery)</li>
<li>Medical records belong to the patient down to the last period, and are due immediately upon request in a transportable format</li>
<li>All medical surgery providers must provide all instances of all complications and negative outcomes on a monthly basis for consumption by the public (de-identified). </li>
<li>Non-requirement of imagine from the provider. You get to chose the imaging provider and all images must be accepted by the primary</li>
<li>You can freely have any test you deem necessary that doesn't require an Rx or Radiation without prior approval from a doctor (e.g. A1C)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are lot more I can share, but let's start with those.. I think these will drive costs down tremendously because it will spur accountability and competition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

There are many modifiable risk factors that contribute to long-term health outcomes for our most cost-intensive disease states; as a physician I’ve noticed a trend towards wanting a “quick fix” for modifiable risk factors such as tobacco, EtOH, obesity, sedentary lifestyle that extend beyond face-to-face clinical medicine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
