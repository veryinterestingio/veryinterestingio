<p>If a person who is currently hallucinating is visually seeing what his mind has imagined, then does that mean that while in this hallucinogenic state where his imagination is being transposed onto his visual image, then if he purposely imagines something else would it override his current hallucination with a new hallucination he thought up? It not, why? </p>
<p>To a degree if I concentrate I can make something look to me as if it is slightly moving, or make myself feel as if the earth is swinging back and forth, subconscious unintentional hallucinations seem much more powerful however, why?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually the brain is not a passive receptor of information. </p>
<p>When you get information from the eyes (an electromagnetic signal), it is compacted and sent through the optic nerve to the thalamus. </p>
<p>There it meets a flow of information from the occipital cortex (where most of the visual areas are). Why is this? so the information from the eyes can be compared to the working model of the real world you are ALREADY predicting. You see with the occipital lobe to say it in a simple way. but it needs to be updated, the flow of information that the optic nerve provides help to update the model you have already in your brain. tweaking it to reflect the information being gathered. </p>
<p>If we depended completely on the input from the eyes and we were a passive receptor of information the brain would not be structured like this. and we would need more brainpower to process what we are seeing. </p>
<p>Most of what we see is just an useful representation of the world, but not that faithful. Remember the white with gold / black with blue dress? It has to do with how your brain decides to handle the available information. colors are not real also, it's something the brain makes up. </p>
<p>Lots of things in our perception are actually illusions. and thats ok. the thing is when you hallucinate you are allowing yourself to process something as an actual perception that should have been inhibited. you have a filter that's not working correctly. Some scientists associate this to an overly active dopaminergic system that's teaching you that certain cognitive processes are reflecting the real world when they are not. it's like the filter has a low threshold to select what is real and what is not when thoughts emerge from what you are watching. the network is being overly active, generating representations that should not be there.</p>
<p>So to answer the question, the difference is the source. but illusions happen all the time, illusions are part of the visual processing system, but having a visual processing system that is too lax in the control of the network activation, leads you to see even more things that are not there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Perception is controlled hallucination, <a href="https://www.edge.org/conversation/andy_clark-perception-as-controlled-hallucination" target="_blank">as Andy Clark explains in this video</a>.</p>
<p>When you look at something, like a painting, you are constantly moving your eyeballs about in visual saccades. Each saccade can be thought of as an experiment. You start off with a hypothesis generated by a predictive model of the world that you've built with experience and you test it against sensory evidence. If there's a match, you don't notice much. But if there's a mismatch, you might sense that something isn't quite right. In science, surprising discoveries result in breakthroughs. Because when you stumble upon something not yet covered by your model, you've stumbled upon something <em>new</em>. And your brain, as fine a scientist as any, treats surprises with the same reverence.</p>
<p>Something very interesting happens when you realize that the proportional influence of the predictive model versus sensory evidence can vary. In psychology, there's a long tradition of distinguishing between top-down and bottom-up processes. The top-down predictive model attempts to &quot;cancel out&quot; the bottom-up sensory input. It can only cancel out what it already expects. So the true quantity of interest is always to be found in errors. But what happens if you expand your acceptable error bar? You become more reliant on your predictive model. You start seeing what you expect to see, because the influence of those pesky errors have decreased. You become somewhat detached from reality, if not delusional. And if you shrink the error bar? You will constantly be bombarded by error signals. The tiniest discrepancy from your model predictions will demand your undivided attention. It will be exhausting.</p>
<p>Dreaming is more like the former, top-down heavy state. It's the flow of unrestrained predictions. It's perhaps interesting to note that in dreams locations and people tend to transform without us realizing it. Which may hint that we rely on error signals as a compensatory working memory mechanism, preventing us from drifting away from reality in waking life.</p>
<p>Different types of hallucinations may involve different brain areas in different levels of the cortical hierarchy. In the V1, the primary visual cortex, low-level visual patterns such as lines slanted in different orientations are processed. If you're familiar with scintillating scotoma--migraine auras--you may have experience with the feeling of having low-level visual areas invade your visual experience. A wave of excitation spreads across the cortex, activating neurons in such a way that there's no way for the brain to distinguish it from natural activation.</p>
<p>Your brain is constantly making predictions, so your visual experience is actually of the expected future rather than the actual present. That might sound bizarre, but it's true. We're talking about much less than a second here, but the fact remains. Prediction errors tether you to reality.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The source of the image is the main difference.</p>
<p>Seeing things visually is when sensory input is sent to your brain and decoded into an image. The brain is just the recepticle to image that's happening.</p>
<p>When seeing things mentally, the brain is directly visualizing without stimulus. It's using memory of objects which it can manipulate to picture say, an apple. Some people are more easily able to replicate these images without sensory input and some aren't able to at all. Aphantasia is the complete inability to mentally imagine images.</p>
<p>Hallucinations are like seeing things mentally but with two differences, they are involuntary and they tend to be mixed with the real sensory input coming into the brain.</p>
<p>In all three of those the actual &quot;seeing&quot; of the image happens in the brain though. It's mostly the source of the image that's the difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>&quot;As LlinÃ¡s and Ribary (1994) proposed during the 1980s, all perception would seem to depend on gamma-band oscillations of approximately 40 Hz in the thalamocortical system. Oscillations which, in the case of sense perception, are modulated by information from the sense organs, which means that that information does not bring us into direct contact with the outside world, but that it restricts the number of degrees of freedom the thalamocortical system has in creating its self-generated percepts. In other words, the thalamocortical systemâ€™s continuous and more or less freewheeling mediation of percepts is restrained by information from the senses, and thus forced to yield only a limited number of its potentially infinite perceptual products. If that hypothesis is true, or at least comes close to being true, it follows that perception is a closed, intrinsic functional state, irrespective of whether we are dreaming, whether we are hallucinating or whether we are perceiving the world in an unclouded state of wakeful consciousness. It follows, in short, that all we ever perceive is the intrinsic products of our brain.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Re: Hallucinating vs Visualizing.</p>
<p>Hallucinations aren't only visual. They can be false sensory experiences related to any number of our sensory systems (ex. auditory- hearing things, visual- seeing things, tactile- falsely feeling as if one is touched). They can occur in isolation of in combination (such as simultaneously seeing and hearing stimuli that aren't there.) In the case of visual hallucinations, one of the significant distinctions between imagining/visualizing something and having a hallucination is how &quot;real&quot; the images seem and how immersive the experience is. Most clinical diagnostic criteria note that hallucinations are sensory perceptions that occur without any physical/environmental stimuli.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
