		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neosporin is a mix of three differnt antibiotics. First one, Neomycin, can actually be used internally, but only kills very specific types of bacteria and typically is not the best choice for internal infections. The second one, bacitracin zinc, is toxic to the kidneys so it cannot be taken internally. The third compund in neosporin, ploymixin b, can be and is used internally, but typically only on bacteria resistant to anything else, as it is both toxic to the kidneys and the nervous system. It is typically used internally only as a last resort, when nothing else will work.</p>
<p>So the short answer is that the main difference is the stuff in neosporin is a bit too toxic to safely swallow unless it is the only chance of stopping an infection that would otherwise be fatal. But it's an antibiotic, just like any other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So Oral Antibiotics (generally) get absorbed by your body and circulate through your blood; IV antibiotics are delivered directly to your bloodstream.  This is useful because your whole body gets bloodflow (certain areas such as joints get very poor bloodflow so infections to those areas are hard to treat). You can treat 'systemic' (bodywide) or just rely on 'blood goes everywhere' to treat infections in a specific area (oral antibiotics for something like strep throat).</p>
<p>Antibiotic ointments are just a paste with antibiotics that are designed to kill (or inhibit growth) of bacteria at the site of an injury (to prevent bacteria from getting into the body through a wound).  This is important because normally your skin protects you from environmental bacteria; a break in your skin provides an opening in that natural barrier.</p>
<p>TL;DR:  IV/Oral antibiotics are 'systemic' (they end up in your blood and go everywhere in your body).  Neosporin etc. are just ointments that provide protection from bacteria locally (specifically at a break in your skin).</p>
<p>Footnote: There are advantages to not providing systemic antibiotic coverage because antibiotics all have side effects and potential adverse effects; limiting excess systemic exposure mitigates risk.</p>
<p>Edit:  If the question is more specifically trying to get at &quot;why do we choose drug X instead of drug Y&quot;... basically different types of bacteria have different traits (cell walls, cell membranes, metabolic pathways, response to oxygen) and antibiotics are designed to optimally kill bacteria with a certain set of traits while minimizing harm to the patient (human cells).  (ex. Bleach is a great way to kill a lot of different kinds of bacteria, but it's a terrible choice for treating an infection because it kills your cells too.)  We also know what types of bacteria are common in a lot of places and what kind of symptoms they cause -- so Neosporin is made of stuff that's great for stopping infections from common skin/environmental bacteria; Oral/IV antibiotics are selected to treat a the bacteria that is suspected (or known) to be causing a patient's problem (we pick different antibiotics for a joint infection vs. a GI tract infection vs. pneumonia or tuberculosis).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bacteria are everywhere.  Good, bad, all over the place.  There's like a billion on the mouse button you just clicked to read this comment.  Your skin does a fairly decent job of not letting bacteria grow in any significant manner by being mostly dryer than bacteria like, but sometimes if your sweaty, bacteria can grow.  Anyways, when you get injured, the area around the wound is moist and full of materials bacteria really like to grow in.   Triple antibiotic ointment is MOSTLY petrolium jelly or some other oil based cream to create an oxygen barrier on the wound surface.  No oxygen, no grow.  The rest are antibiotics that keep the population of any bacteria that are stubborn in control.  Mainly by just outright killing them.   As long as the populations are held in check as the wound drys out and scabs over, the chance for infection greatly reduces.  </p>
<p>It's a tool to control infection, in that manner its similar to oral and IV antibiotics, but it's designed to work in different conditions against bacteria attacking from a different vector than the aforementioned antibiotic methods are designed for.  They are designed to control infections internal to the body, where the moisture content cannot be controlled and rely solely on their bactericidal features to treat or prevent infection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
