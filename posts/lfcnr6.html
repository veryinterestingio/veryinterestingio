		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Traditional hour glasses are open at the end and capped by a wooden cap. So you can make an hour glass but leave one end open. Then you put it next to a sundial and fill it with sand exactly when the shadow on the sundial crosses a mark. Then at the next mark you stop the hourglass and poar out the excess before you cap the other end as well. That leaves you with an hourglass that have exactly enough sand to last an hour and no more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They calibrated them against sundials which are pretty accurate and can be constructed anywhere. A sundial uses the movements of a shadow across the floor to measure time. An hourglass is more convenient in that it is portable. They also used various other portable devices, like candle clocks and water clocks etc., all ultimately calibrated and verified against a stationary sundial.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've got a related question: do hourglasses run faster over time as the sand inside abrades itself?</p>
<p>Edit: Since this seems unlikely to be answered here, I researched it and found it a bit outside of ELI5 territory. Anyway there is this thing called the Hagen-Beverloo law on the outflow of granular solids that seems to indicate that yes, provided the total mass of the particles and the size of the funnel aperturue remains constant, the hourglass will speed up if the diameter of the grains were assumed to decrease over time due to wear. Specifically given <code>d.I</code> and <code>d.F</code> representing initial and final grain diameter and <code>a</code> the funnel aperture size, the ratio of total time will change by <code>T(d.I)/T(d.F) = (a-d.I / a-d.F)^(2/5)</code> leading to the conclusion, that as seems to be intuitive, the hourglass will speed up if the sand was able to wear itself down and become smaller or alternatively to wear the aperture to become larger.</p>
<p>Anyone with kids: this would be a solid science fair project.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In ancient times water clocks were used.  You would have a bowl that floated in water.  Then punch a small hole in the bowl so that water would slowly leak in.  It would take time for the bowl to fill up with water and sink.  You would time things by the bowl.  For instance you might pay for a massage that would last one bowl.</p>
<p>When these were made, there was no precised short units of time and no way of measuring them.  You did not make a bowl that lasted 5 minutes because there was no such thing as 5 minutes.  </p>
<p>You made a bowl that lasted a time that seemed right.  Or you would measure how long a bowl took to fill compared to another bowl and slowly increase the size of the hole until they took the same amount of time.</p>
<p>Hourglasses were the same.  The amount of time they measured was the amount of time they measured.  There was no precise minute to make an hourglass that time a minute.</p>
<p>When mechanical clocks were invented and time got rigidly defined with precise hours, minutes, and seconds (in Roman times, the length of an hour varied by time of day and year), then hourglasses were calibrated to a particular time by adjusting the amount of sand inside them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
