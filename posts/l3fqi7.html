		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Consider a very thin (like hair-thin) circle made of thin wire, but about the same diameter as your donut. Now heat it. What does it do? It expands, of course. If it was straight, it would expand; if you make it into a loop, it still expands.</p>
<p>Now, from the outer surface of the metal ring, isolate (cut) such a thin circle. Heat it. It expands, right?</p>
<p>Cut a circle from the ring at any depth you like, it does the same. Even if you cut it from the inner rim of the ring, it still expands.</p>
<p>Your donut ring is basically like a lot of thin circles like this, welded together. They all expand when heated. They expand together.</p>
<hr />
<p>You are concerned about all these circles somehow getting &quot;thicker&quot; as they heat up, and pushing the inner circles inwards. And that's a valid concern. But the room created by expansion along the circumference (which then increases the diameter) compensates for that.</p>
<hr />
<p>Another way to look at it: consider a solid disk. It expands, right?</p>
<p>Now cut the center out of it, make it into a donut. Why should the donut behave differently? The centerpiece (which you just cut) also expands. Whether it's still part of the original disk, or it's cut out, the rim of the centerpiece and the inner rim of the donut do the same - they expand.</p>
<p>Think of any solid as a bunch of balls connected by sticks:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/Tl7jD9N.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/Tl7jD9N.jpg</a></p>
<p>When you heat it up, the sticks grow longer. That happens along the outer rim of the donut, but also along the inner rim. All possible rims just expand together.</p>
<p>A &quot;solid&quot; solid, or a solid full of holes - they all expand the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a classic example of counterintuitive physics.  Imagine this: if you have a sheet of steel and you scribe a circle into it, then heat the whole sheet, does the circle grow or shrink?</p>
<p>Now cut out that circle and heat the disc you cut out.  Does it grow or shrink?  </p>
<p>The answer to both of course is that they grow.  So necessarily, the hole in the sheet that the disc came from must also grow at an equal rate.  Otherwise you would have some weird nonuniform internal stresses when you heat the whole sheet.</p>
<p>Edit: this is in contrast to a cooked piece of dough like a bagel or donut, which expands outward from its local center in all directions, closing the hole.  I don't have a good physics explanation for this difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
