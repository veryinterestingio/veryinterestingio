<p>Why is 18 the maximum amount of electrons an atomic shell can hold?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not.  18 is the maximum amount of electrons that the <em>third</em> shell can hold.  Other shells have different maxima:  the first shell can only hold 2 electrons; the second shell can hold 8, the third can hold 18, the fourth can hold 32, and so on.  Each shell can hold 2n^(2) electrons.</p>
<p>This formula arises because electrons are fermions (particles with half-integer spin) and fermions are required to occupy distinct quantum states.  Electrons in atoms have four separate quantum numbers that can take different integer values, with the allowed ranges of some quantum numbers determined by the value of others.  For example, the principle quantum number n denotes the shell number -- it starts at 1, counting up from there until that shell is filled with electrons; once it is full, additional electrons occupy the next shell with n=2, and so on.  The azimuthal quantum number l (lowercase L) starts at 0 and increases up to a maximum of n-1 ... so when n=1, then l=0, but when n=2, l can have a value of either 0 or 1, and when n=3 then l can have a value of 0, 1, or 2.  Then there's the magnetic quantum number m which has the same range as l except it can also take on negative values.  So at n=2, m can be any of -1, 0, and 1.  And at n=3, m can be -2, -1, 0, 1, or 2.  And finally, for every unique pair of n, l, and m, each electron also has a spin projection of either +1/2 or -1/2 depending on whether it is spin-up or spin-down.  So then, the first electron must have (n=1, l=0, m=0) and either possible value of s, and the second electron must have the same numbers but the opposite-signed value of s.  Then the first shell is filled.  The third and fourth electrons will have (n=2, l=0, m=0), the fifth and sixth will have (n=2, l=1, m=0), the seventh and eigth (n=2, l=1, m=1), ninth and tenth (n=2, l=1, m=-1), and then the second shell is filled, and so on.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The 2, 8, 8, 18, 18 thing is really just an oversimplification of a far more complicated thing in the quantum model of the atom called electron orbitals. Crash course does a pretty decent video about it (The Electron: Crash Course Chemistry #5). I'll give it a shot assuming you're in early high school and just learning this stuff for the first time.</p>
<p>Every time we get to a new noble gas, the periodic table starts to repeat its properties. In the early days, this was taken as evidence that we had reached a new valence shell which shielded the previous shells. The evidence came from the energy levels of the electrons that were added or taken away from the atoms.</p>
<p>As scientists got better at studying the atom, a pattern emerged: in the first shell, both electrons had the same energy, but in the second and third &quot;shells&quot;, two electrons had a lower energy than the other six.</p>
<p>This led to subshell theory. There are 4 subshells, which can hold (in order) 2, 6, 10, and 14 electrons. There are further subshells (that pattern continues), but they are not commonly observed in everyday atoms or molecules.</p>
<p>So where does 2, 8, 8, 18, 18 come from? Well the first shell can only have the first subshell (2 electrons), but the second can have the first and second (2 + 6 = 8). The third technically has all three subshells (2 + 6 + 10 = 18), but as you get higher in energy the shells start to get closer to each other so the first two electrons in the fourth shell kind of sneak in before the last ten in the third shell.</p>
<p>Those first two electrons make a big spherical bubble around the atom, shielding the subshells beneath them, so that's where the periodic table restarts. That's why the third row of the table only has 8 elements. The other 10 electrons are only used in the 4th row (mind you, having those subshells available does change the chemistry of the atoms, making molecules like POCl3 possible).</p>
<p>To answer your initial question, 18 is not the limit, even in the old school periodic table. The 6th and 7th row already contain 32 elements (2 + 6 + 10 + 14) and theoretically the next row would have 50!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The third shell of a hydrogen-like atom has orbitals that could hold 18 electrons because:</p>
<p>1) Half of 18 is 9. This accounts for the fact that an orbital can hold two electrons. So the third shell of an atom can 18 electrons because it has 9 orbitals. Why does the third shell of an atom have 9 orbitals?</p>
<p>2) 9 is the sum of 1 + 3 + 5. This accounts for the fact that the third shell of an atom has three subshells. The first subshell has one orbital, the second has three orbitals, and the third has five orbitals. Why does this sequence 1, 3, and 5 occur?</p>
<p>3) 1, 3, and 5 is the sequence of three numbers formed by starting with 1 and adding 2 to the next number in the sequence. Each subshell in a shell has two more orbitals than the previous subshell, starting with one. Why does each subshell have 2 more orbitals than the previous subshell starting with one orbital in the first subshell?</p>
<p>4) Solve the absolute value equation |<em>m</em>|=0. There is one solution, <em>m</em> = 0. That's why the first subshell in a shell has one orbital. Next solve |<em>m</em>|=0 or 1. There are now three solutions, <em>m</em> = {-1,0,1}. The solution to |<em>m</em>|=0 or 1 or 2 has five solutions, <em>m</em> = {-2,-1,0,1,2}. In general, for integer values of <em>l</em>&gt;0 the solution to |<em>m</em>| = 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or <em>l</em> will always have two more solutions, {-<em>l</em> and <em>l</em>}, than the solution to |<em>m</em>| = 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or <em>l</em>-1. That's why each subshell has 2 more orbitals than the previous subshell. Why does this absolute value equation, |<em>m</em>| = 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or <em>l</em>, determine the number of orbitals in subshells?</p>
<p>5) Find the orbital angular momentum eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of a one particle system using spherical polar coordinates and spherical harmonics on the Schrödinger equation.</p>
<p>That isn't easy for most people.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not. The number of possible electrons in each shell is dictated by the principal quantum number, n. For each n there are a set of other possible quantum numbers (these numbers describe certain properties of the electrons) that must be within certain ranges (which are dictated by the value of n or another quantum number, although ultimately they all indirectly depend on n) and each electron can only have one particular configuration of those numbers (groups of these numbers are called subshells). </p>
<p>So that limits how many electrons can be in a shell, there can only be as many electrons as the subshells can hold and thus as many available choices of quantum numbers. But you can make n as big as you want and if you add enough electrons you can get higher and higher numbers and so add more and more electrons to each shell.</p>
<p>The reason we only see a maximum of 18 for atoms we see commonly in the world around us (though not all natural atoms) is that they don't have enough electrons to reach these higher principal numbers because electrons repel each other and the reason there's a maximum for natural atoms is big enough atoms become unstable. Also generally it's more energetically favourable, i.e it takes less energy, to fill higher up low subshells, like 5s, than it does to fill lower down high subshells, like 4f, for a lot of reasons. For example it's more favourable to have a full higher subshell than a half full lower one. </p>
<p>If you look at carbon for example it has 12 electrons, so if it just went in order it would have it's electron configuration as 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 2d^2, because those are the first 12 available slots for electrons with the lowest possible n. However if you check you'll see that carbon has an electron configuration of 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electrons are arranged around the nucleus of an atom. A neutral atom has exactly as many electrons as protons. The states of these electrons are described by a unique set of quantum numbers (because electrons are fermions and can't share quantum states) <strong>N</strong>, <strong>L</strong>, <strong>m</strong>, and <strong>s</strong>.</p>
<p>These are the direct result of solving the Schrodinger Equation for electron states around a nucleus, and the solution has 3 parts: a radial part that describes how far from the nucleus the electrons are, an angular part that describes where around the nucleus they are, and a spin part that describes the behavior of the electrons themselves.</p>
<p><strong>N</strong> describes the energy level of the electrons, and it is the radial quantum number, corresponding to how far from the nucleus the electrons are. <strong>N</strong> starts at 1, and goes up by 1 for each new level: 1,2,3,4... and so on.</p>
<p><strong>L</strong> and <strong>m</strong> are the angular quantum numbers, describing a particular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics" target="_blank">Spherical Harmonic</a> state around the nucleus for each electron.</p>
<p><strong>L</strong> describes the total magnitude of the angular momentum of the electron, which can range from 0 to <strong>N</strong>-1. In chemistry speak, each different value of <strong>L</strong> represents a different kind of orbital. <strong>L</strong>=0 are S orbitals, <strong>L</strong>=1 are P orbitals, <strong>L</strong>=2 are D orbitals, <strong>L</strong>=3 are F orbitals, and so on.</p>
<p>This is why only certain energy levels have certain orbitals: you have to go at least to enenergy level <strong>N</strong>=3 to get D orbitals, be cause the maximum of <strong>L</strong> is <strong>N</strong>-1=2.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong> is the <em>projection</em> of the angular momentum. Basically, pick a direction and measure how much of the electron's angular momentum falls along that direction. <strong>m</strong> can range from <strong>-L</strong> to <strong>L</strong>. </p>
<p>So, <strong>L</strong>=0 can only have <strong>m</strong>=0, which makes sense, there's no angular momentum to project, its zero no matter where you look at it from. <strong>L</strong>=1 can have 3 states for <strong>m</strong>: -1, 0, 1; therefore there are 3 P orbitals. <strong>L</strong>=2 can have 5 states: <strong>m</strong>=-2,-1,0,1,2 so there are 5 D orbitals. And similarly there are 7 F orbitals from -3 to 3.</p>
<p>Finally we have the spin part of the solution, described by <strong>s</strong>. For electrons <strong>s</strong> is always either +1/2 or -1/2. What exactly <strong>s</strong> represents is a little bit subtle, but you can think of it like whether the electron is spinning clockwise or counterclockwise. The only rule is that 2 electrons with the same <strong>N</strong>, <strong>L</strong>, and <strong>m</strong> <em>must</em> have opposite <strong>s</strong> states. </p>
<p>This means that 2 electrons can fit into each orbital, one with <strong>s</strong>=+1/2 and the other with <strong>s</strong>=-1/2. This is why there are 2 electrons in the S shell, 6 in the P shell, 10 in the D shell, and 14 in the F shell. </p>
<p>Put together, you can add up how many electrons max out each energy level:</p>
<p><strong>N</strong>=1 Only S shell, so only 2 electrons</p>
<p><strong>N</strong>=2 S &amp; P shells, so 2+6=8 electrons</p>
<p><strong>N</strong>=3 S, P, &amp; D shells, so 2+6+10=<strong>18 electrons</strong></p>
<p><strong>N</strong>=4 S, P, D, &amp; F, so 2+6+10+14=32 electrons</p>
<p>And if you count the elements in each row of the periodic table, you will find that there are that many per row (although you have to reinsert the Lanthanides and Actinides which have F orbitals as their valence electrons, and are usually put on their own below the rest of the table, for space reasons. They belong between the S block of the left 2 columns, and the D block of the transition metals).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
