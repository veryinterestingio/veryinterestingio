		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an attention issue.  Your attention is so focused on locating the object in its usual spots, it goes into pattern detection mode, searching, and your brain is great at that.  Your brain is ALSO really great at ignoring superfluous information - like, you don't need to be consciously aware that it's daytime and cloudy and 68* in your kitchen and you can hear the wind outside and your left sock is slightly twisted and so on and so forth, because it's irrelvant, so it's masked off from your perception by a <em>perceptual filter</em>.  Unfortunately that also includes the contents of your hands because they're irrelevant sensory data and you're in pattern detection mode.  It's a good example of your brain working against you, accidentally, because you've defied its usual expectations.</p>
<p>edit:  to all the people whose perceptual filters I just glitched, sorry.  Your left sock is twisted because you're right handed and put it on in a hurry this morning.  To all the lefties, now's the time to realize your right sock is in fact <em>slightly</em> misaligned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You become accustomed to the feeling of it in your hand and tune it out. It's basically the same reason why we can't feel our clothes all the time.</p>
<p>Another idea might be &quot;body mapping&quot;, where our brain learns to treat other objects as an extension of our bodies. I.e. when you're driving a car, you don't think &quot;Okay, I'll push my foot down, which depresses the accelerator, which will make the car go faster.&quot;. You think &quot;<em>I'll</em> go faster.&quot;. When you play a video game, you look around with a mouse/joystick as intuitively as with your own neck or eyes, because you stop noticing the controller as the conduit for your actions.</p>
<p>It's possible that when we body map something, we forget it as an object? I.e. If I want to text someone, I'll just start making the motions with my fingers, but if I want to find my phone, suddenly it's lost because I'm looking for an object that my brain thinks is actually a part of my body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>your brain maintains a model of the world around you. It does not take a snapshot of the entire world and assess it momentum moment, but looks for changes instead. If a change is missed you separate &quot;change blindness&quot;. There are some great videos of this being done as experimental actions or pranks. In these videos whole people get replaced mid-conversation and the person they're talking to doesn't notice. Things like that.</p>
<p>So if you pick up your keys from an unlikely location, or you've had them on you for a long time, or something like that, they may be missed classified in your brain. because you continue to possess the item in exactly the same way you possessed it after the mistake has been entered, you are blind to its existence. The thing in your hand or on your head or whatever has already been disqualified as the object you're looking for. and as such you won't look for it there again.</p>
<p>It can also happen for physical objects that you're not touching. You can look at an object that you're looking for, specifically or by category, and if you've already classified it as not of interest your brain will continue to skip over it.</p>
<p>Most of your sense of reality, and your entire sense of time, are really just ongoing updates to this continuous model.</p>
<p>There are ancillary effects, and these effects are necessary for your brain to function. For instance sound and vision only have to match up within 80 milliseconds. Your sense of now is actually about 80 milliseconds out of date. But that's why movies and TV actually work. As long as the brain can correlate the mouth movements to the sound it doesn't matter that they don't match perfectly.</p>
<p>Simply put, your consciousness lives in a fabricated reality inside your brain meat, and it pretty much only labels things once as they enter your field of perception.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
