		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good question!</p>
<p>They don't actually store electricity. When they say they have extra, what they mean is they have the generators to make more than they need. If the generators are at a dam using water to make electricity, it's hard to &quot;save&quot; the extra capacity because if the water doesn't flow through the dam there will be a flood upstream. So they have to let the water flow downstream without using it to make electricity. Some places, they actually use the extra water to make electricity, then use that electricity to pump water uphill into a storage reservoir, where they can use it later. That tends to happen at night, when everyone's asleep and not using electricity. In fact power companies typically charge less for electricity at night to encourage factories to use it when people are asleep and not using it.</p>
<p>A power company needs enough generators to supply power at the time of highest demand. Then some of those generators sit and do nothing when demand is lower, and a machine doing nothing is a waste of money, so power companies look for ways to keep the generators running all the time so they are making money instead of sitting doing nothing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Although some areas with dams use surplus electricity to raise the water levels of those dams so more water can be let through when there's a demand for electricity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electricity can’t currently be ‘stored’ in the quantities required to be useful for national-scale grids. There are industrial scale batteries but these aren’t really - to the best of my knowledge - suitable for the scale needed. </p>
<p>So what do we do? We have excess electricity and we need to do something with it. How about we convert it to something else? Electricity is, after all, energy. Energy can’t be destroyed but it can be converted. </p>
<p>Examples of such energy storage mechanisms are ‘Electric Mountain’ in Wales (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinorwig_Power_Station" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinorwig_Power_Station</a>), which takes electricity from the grid at periods of excess and pumps water up a mountain, then during times of peak demand releases that water through turbines to generate electricity. </p>
<p>There are all kinds of possible ways to do this. Some are more efficient than others, and they all have their own problems and suitable applications.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're not storing much. For a few seconds you have energy stored in the rotating mass of the generating equipment. You can also use battery storage to give you enough time to bring more power generation online. </p>
<p>For long term storage, you can pump water uphill into a reservoir, and then turn it back into electricity as needed. Though usually cheaper to skip the uphill pumping and rely on rain. </p>
<p>The vast majority of the power generated is used in less than a second. Often they'll have spare generators already spun up and ready so they can increase power generation more quickly. They'll also predict load based on past usage. I remember a story about power plants starting up more generation at the start of a commercial break, anticipating the increased load from people making tea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
