		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: Yes ... Maybe. It's complicated</p>
<p>The long term side effects of various virus infections have been a part of research for some time now. It is hard to correlate these diseases with certain virus because the symptoms are usually long term and show up later in life. There have been some viruses maaaaaybe linked to varius cardiovascular diseases or diabetes and even alzheimer's research, some papers (that I won't link cuz I'm lazy) found &quot;viral factories&quot; in patients brain autopsy. </p>
<p>The virus may affect the respiratory system the most severly and effectively, but apart from your lungs the virus can still spread and affect other parts of your body through the bloodvessels.</p>
<p>If the virus is able to spread systematically (inside your bloodstream) and finds a cell it can bind to, it can and will most likely try to infect said cell. This cell could be any organ of your body that the virus can identify. The virus can also mutate inside your body to attack other organs (although at a much smaller scale). </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes.

And in the aftermath of the 1918 flu there was an &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalitis_lethargica" target="_blank">encephalitis lethargica</a>&quot; wave, which may have been related.

<p>Guillan-Barre syndrome and viral myocarditis are some of the more well known illnesses associated with viral infections. GBS is even associated with flu vaccines. </p>
<p>Though not a respiratory illness, untreated HIV can result in dementia.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>There is no control group.</p>
<p>Viruses have influenced organisms down to the DNA level since the dawn of life on this planet.</p>
<p>To say &quot;no&quot; to this question in any form is a blatant oversight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Warts are some of the most common sequaele caused by viral infections. Plus, as others already stated, roughly 16% of our DNA are left overs from viruses. Some of these DNA changes are cause of cancer or other severe hereditary diseases. Others have a positive side effect and are sometimes suggested to be beginning an advancement step up for a species.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
