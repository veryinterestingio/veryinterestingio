		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cell turnover. </p>
<p>Primary heart muscle tumors are exceedingly rare. Why? Because once a heart muscle cell differentiates into a mature cell, it might make some adjustments throughout its life, but it doesn't divide to create a new heart muscle cell. </p>
<p>There's a regular rate of turnover of the cells in your toe. Depending on the exact cell (bone-related, skin, nervous, immune) there are different rates of turnover, but once you grow an adult toe, there's not a lot of change taking place down there.</p>
<p>Breast tissue is different because it isn't run on a single script. It gets an input from the body's hormones. Estrogen UP, breast tissue adjustment. Period time? Breast tissue adjustment. Baby time? Breast tissue adjustment. As a result there's a natural ebb and flow to the tissue, enough to generate a significantly higher rate of cellular turnover. Cut off the signal, mammary glands shrink up. Turn the volume up on the signal, mammary glands cells divide to provide for reproduction. (For the record, the prostate has a similar downside with hormonal input).</p>
<p>Every time a copy is made, there's a chance for a clerical error in the code. The more copies, the more chances for errors, some percentage of which will be catastrophic. </p>
<p>Go out in the sun a lot? Burn that top layer of skin often? More skin cells are required to replace the damaged cells. Higher turn over = increased risk of skin cancer (not to mention the sun radiation increasing the risk of damaged DNA copies). </p>
<p>Over active immune system? Much better chance for an error to occur in an immune cell. Here comes the lymphoma.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cancer is something that happens when a cell accumulates certain kinds of mutations that break the normal mechanisms of the cell, causing it to reproduce rapidly and evade the anti-cancer mechanisms cells have evolved, like spontaneously committing suicide when something happens in the cell that looks a bit like cancer. </p>
<p>Some cells are more susceptible to mutation than others - cells that do more cell division have far more opportunities to copy DNA incorrectly or to make  temporary mutations permanent (cells contain mutation repair mechanisms, but those can't repair mutations after DNA replication sets them in stone). Toe cells aren't really doing much. They just reproduce to replace any cells that die and to produce new layers of skin. Certain kinds of cell however are sensitive to the growth hormone oestrogen - when they detect oestrogen, they increase their rate of reproduction. This is true particularly of breast cells, but the same mechanisms are responsible for prevalence of cancer in many sexually dimorphic tissues, including the ovaries and prostate. This means breast cells are reproducing a lot more than toe cells, and the more oestrogen in the body, the faster they reproduce. This gives more opportunities for one or more breast cells to develop cancerous mutations. It also allows mutations in the cellular mechanisms that detect oestrogen to increase risk of cancer too, something cells without these oestrogen mechanisms don't do. </p>
<p>Cancer is all a game of chance. It's like Russian Roulette - the more times you pull the trigger, the higher the likelihood you pull the trigger on a chamber that contains a bullet. Breast cells pull that trigger a lot more often than toe cells, by reproducing a lot more often.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of it is genetics, some of it is cell turnover rates, carcinogens that are cell specific, dna mutations, higher concentrations of cancer promoting agents (hormones). Cancer is a mix of multiple bad things happening at once, and not much of those things happen in the toes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
