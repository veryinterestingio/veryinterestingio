		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Reddit, tomorrow is National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day, and we hope you'll have a gas! Hydrogen and fuel cells are the perfect partners for clean, fuel-efficient transportation and a secure energy future. Here at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), we have expertise in creating low carbon hydrogen from natural gas, and we have two projects we want to discuss with you. The first is Solar Thermochemical Advanced Reactor System-or STARS, a technology that converts a record-setting 70 percent of solar energy into chemical energy, such as hydrogen. STARS uses thermal energy from the sun to break down natural gas and water into hydrogen and carbon dioxide in a steam methane reforming process. PNNL licensed STARS to a spin-off company, STARS, LLC, who is working with Southern California Gas Company to implement the technology. Read about STARS here: <a href="https://www.greencarcongress.com/2018/05/20181518-stars.html" target="_blank">https://www.greencarcongress.com/2018/05/20181518-stars.html</a>.</p>
<p>The second project uses a low-emission process to convert natural gas to hydrogen, carbon fiber, and carbon nanotubes. The process creates hydrogen that can be used in fuel cell vehicles and industrial processes, as well as carbon fiber that can be used in applications from medical devices and aerospace structures to building products. The goal of the project is to make hydrogen-fueled cars and trucks cost-competitive with conventional gasoline and diesel vehicles. In addition, this technology would virtually eliminate CO2 emissions from the methane-to-hydrogen process. The technology development and commercialization team includes PNNL; West Virginia University; Southern California Gas Company; and C4-MCP, a Santa Monica-based start-up company. Read more about project here: <a href="https://www.greencarcongress.com/2018/01/20180105-socalgas.html" target="_blank">https://www.greencarcongress.com/2018/01/20180105-socalgas.html</a>.</p>
<p>We invite you to look over the information in these links, and we will be back at 11-1 PDT (2-4 ET, UT) to answer your questions.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On STARS, </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How is the 70% efficiency noted in the article defined, and what's the overall energy balance?  If we think of the solar input as &quot;free&quot; and the methane as the input energy, what is the efficiency in producing hydrogen, and how does that change if we also consider the chemical energy stored in the chemical products produced?</p>
</li>
<li>Also, an alternative would be to run the  methane through a combined cycle gas turbine to produce electricity, run a carbon capture and sequestration process on the exhaust, and use PV over the same collection area.  Then that electricity could be used in EVs.  How does the efficiency compare between those two, from methane input to electric output from the batteries or fuel cell.  I'd say well to wheels, but the well-to-methane-delivery part should be the same and the electric propulsion system should be the same so we can compare pretty well without going all the way to well to wheels.</li>
</ol>
<p>Given that STARS can produce useful chemical feedstocks, and given that fuel cells are good for some niche applications even without a highly efficient way to produce hydrogen, STARS  sounds like a great process even if the answers to my questions are not favorable, but I would like to understand how broadly it could make sense to use it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On the carbon fiber process,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>CO2 emissions are said to be virtually eliminated.  I'm excited to have them significantly reduced at all, so virtually eliminated sounds great, but it is also vague.  I appreciate that there's likely some uncertainty, and so I don't expect you can give me an exact number, but can you say what order of magnitude the emissions reduction is?  Is it safe to assume that the climate emissions would be dominated by methane leaks in the drilling, pipeline, and distribution systems?</p>
</li>
<li>What's the scale of the hydrogen production from this is all the carbon fiber production is the US or in the world was switched over to this process?  That's only a baseline scoping question, as carbon fiber production is presumably increasing fairly rapidly, but will give and idea of the scale of the contribution this could make.</li>
