<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The current understanding is that variations of blood types arose from genetic mutations. It is understood that the &quot;original&quot; blood type was A, although some believe it may have been a form of O, and the others followed after due to natural selection.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Type A suffer more severely from malaria. Type O and B seem to be more protected.<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/104/44/17471" target="_blank">Blood group O protects against severe Plasmodium falciparum ... - PNAS</a></p>

<p>There was a link found between Type O blood and duodenal ulcers as well as a link between Type A blood and gastric cancer.</p>

<p>There is evidence that supports that certain blood types may predispose to certain diseases. Some interesting examples are in the discussion of this paper.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The blood types are based on various proteins, glycoproteins (sugars attached to proteins), carbohydrates, and other chemicals in the red cell membranes. Often, these proteins have a functional purpose, like pumping various ions or other molecules into or out of the red blood cell. On the other hand, a lot of them, we simply don't know their function yet.</p>
<p>For example, the Rh protein is suspected to be a transport molecule for ammonia, but might be for some other molecule. On the other hand, the Duffy antigen is a receptor for several different cell signalers; however there are two species of malaria that have developed the ability to use the Duffy antigen to &quot;hook on&quot; to the red cell and get inside where it can continue its life cycle. This is why, for example, certain populations (e.g., Africans) are far more likely to lack the Duffy antigens than others, because if one lacks those antigens, they are virtually immune to those two species of malaria (but not the other species, unfortunately).</p>
<p>In the grand scheme of things, the blood type has one discernible effect on people: An Rh negative (i.e., A-, B-, O-, or AB-) mother exposed to the Rh antigen can develop an anti-D antibody that can cross the placenta and attack a fetus that is Rh positive. (i.e., A+, B+, O+, AB+). Other antigens, like Duffy, not associated with classic blood type, can confer benefits or weaknesses, but they are rare enough to seldom be a concern outside of transfusion medicine.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The relationship between blood groups and disease:</p>
<p>&quot;There are clear examples of protection against infectious diseases from inheritance of polymorphisms in genes encoding and regulating the expression of ABH and Lewis antigens in bodily secretions particularly in respect of <em>Helicobacter pylori</em>, norovirus, and cholera infections. However, available evidence suggests surviving malaria is the most significant selective force affecting the expression of blood groups. &quot; -- <a href="http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/115/23/4635?sso-checked=true" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/115/23/4635?sso-checked=true" target="_blank">http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/115/23/4635?sso-checked=true</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Patients who are blood group O have 25% less von Willebrand factor when compared to the other blood groups (major factor in the initiation of clotting). Many people diagnosed with type 1 von Willebrand disease are found to be group 0 - this also makes diagnosis of true type 1 vWD difficult in group O individuals. </p>
<p>On the flip side, whilst individuals with any other blood group other than O have more von Willebrand factor, they are also at a higher risk of developing a venous thromboembolism. </p>
