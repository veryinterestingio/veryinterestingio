		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ultimately it's your brain that taking in all the input you're receiving and decides that it's time to go into sex mode so you can reproduce it's it's just hard coded into our DNA that way. The chemical feel good stuff follows after. So it's not the chemicals causing you to be &quot;horny&quot;. We don't have conscious control over a lot of things in our bodies and this is one of them as such the autopilot isn't perfect so yeah certain things can cause your brain to trigger an arousal state for no reason at all or for really obtuse reasons but it generally leans in the better safe than sorry direction so if there's something that can even remotely be perceived as the potential for sex by your brain then it has to potential to cause arousal. Sometimes this is obvious stimulus like porn for example but it could be be really obtuse or totally random even.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For males: </p>
<p>testosterone and dopamine go up =&gt; downstream effect on other hormonal systems.</p>
<p>Hormonal fluctuations and the 'dopamine addiction' will keep you coming back.</p>
<p>We have a hunger hormone called ghrelin that makes us hungry. When we eat, ghrelin lowers and produces that pleasant feeling. Without ghrelin and similar hormones, you wouldn't seek out food, you wouldn't get addicted to food, and you would die.</p>
<p>Ghrelin also plays a role in sexuality, addiction, testosterone, dopamine, and the seeking/wanting response.</p>
<p>When an alcoholic sees a commercial for beer, they get triggered, they remember the pleasure and then want to seek it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well &quot;horny&quot; isn't really a medical term.  Arousal is a thing, involving the brain and physical stimulus.  There isn't a chemical that &quot;makes you aroused&quot;, in spite of centuries of seeking such a substance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if there's a detailed description of that, but for sure it will not be one chemical that triggers sexual arousal (aka being horny). My educated guess is that the stimulus (specially visual, touch and smell) is sent through your brain stem to the hypothalamus and limbic areas (basolateral amygdala most likely). Now, the amygdala is basically a GABAergic and gluramatergic nucleus, so these chemicals (GABA and glutamate) will be released in the amygdala to signal the valence of the stimulus (if it's good or bad). From there, the information will be sent to the appropriate brain area to control behavior, in particular the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. In the mean time, hormones will be released by the hypothalamus, probably oxytocin (attachment hormone) and some stress hormone like adrenaline. The signal from the amygdala will also probably make its way to the reward system of the brain, where dopamine and serotonin will likely be release to indicate a positive reinforce and the emotional correlate of feel good. That would be my guess.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
