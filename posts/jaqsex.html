		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the things you’re talking about from back in the day were using magnetic fields to function...CRT TVs and monitors for example using the field to control the light and color emission. Putting a strong enough magnet nearby would screw with the performance and maybe even damage the equipment. </p>
<p>There were also a lot of magnetic storage media at the time...like, almost all of them. Audio and video tape, floppy discs, etc. a strong enough magnet would erase information and really screw things up. </p>
<p>Things now are not only shielded better, but also not as reliant on magnetic fields.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very few things are really damaged by magnets, mostly just CRTs (they use electromagnets to move the beam) and magnetic storage (which use magnets to write data), and magnetic hard drives generally need a very strong magnet to do damage, putting a fridge magnet on the case won't do anything.</p>
<p>Modern phones don't have any of that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Today's electronics are not the same as older technology.</p>
<p>Magnets will affect/damage CRT's (television and monitor displays); hard drives (computers and laptops); magnetic tape (VCR's).</p>
<p>Phones now actually have magnetic sensors in them and many flip covers for phones have magnets on in them to keep the cover closed (or open) and some phones and most tablets use a magnetic sensor to turn on and off the screen</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
