		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're asking which planet has the <em>brightest</em> moonlight, that's something we can answer objectively. It comes down to (a) how big is/are the moon(s), (b) how far away they are, (c) what fraction of the Sun's light they reflect, and (d) how bright the Sun is at this distance (i.e. how much light there is available to reflect).</p>
<p>My first guess is that Earth has the brightest moonlight, because the Moon is one of the biggest moons in the solar system, and it's far closer to the Sun than any other large moon, but we can look at the maths.</p>
<p>Jupiter has 4 moons larger than 1000 km (and none from 100-1000 km, apparently) - Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa, the classic Galilean moons. Three of these (not Europa) are bigger than the Moon. However, Jupiter is 5x further away from the Sun than the Earth is, so the sunlight is 25x dimmer. The closest large moon to Jupiter's surface is Io, which is about the size and distance as our Moon is. Europa is about 2x as far away from Jupiter as our Moon is from Earth, Ganymede is about 3x, and Callisto is about 4x further away. Doubling the distance gives you 1/4 as much light, and you have another 1/25th as much light to start with, so they'll all be much dimmer than the Moon. Io apparently has a higher albedo than the Moon - it's much shinier, and reflects a higher fraction of light - but that's not enough to counter that it gets 1/25th as much light to start with. However, the total sky area of these moons does add up to more than our Moon has from Earth - if you're on a space station in low Jupiter orbit, you will see Io about as big as the Moon appears from Earth, plus several other moons visible as small discs.</p>
<p>Saturn only has one moon larger than 1000 km, though it has several moons from 100-1000 km. Titan is maybe 50% bigger than the Moon, but it's about 3x further away from Saturn than the Moon is from us, and sunlight at Saturn is like 90x dimmer than it is at Earth. So Titan (and several smaller moons) will be visible as discs. The total angular area may add up to be comparable to Earth's moon, but the brightness will be far less. Neptune has Triton which is a bit smaller than the Moon and at a similar distance, but the sunlight is getting even dimmer at that point.</p>
<p>Pluto (if you want to count dwarf planets) is actually really close to Charon though. From Pluto's surface, Charon looks 6x the diameter of the full moon as seen from Earth. It is of course incredibly dim because you're so far from the Sun, but that's actually the most moon-dominated sky in terms of angular area/&quot;solid angle&quot;.</p>
<p>So yes, the Earth's surface gets more moonlight than any other planet in the solar system. But if you don't care about brightness, and only care about what fraction of sky is covered by moon, then Pluto/Charon actually wins, and Jupiter beats Earth too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>I'm unsure what you mean by this. Normally when we talk about having a good night sky, we mean we can see lots of stars, or the moon is bright. The less atmosphere you have, the brighter the stars and moon will be. So on Mars, for instance, you will see more stars, and they will be brighter.</p>
<p>Mars also has much smaller moons, though, which will give you much less moonlight. An advantage of that, though, is that you would be able to see two small moons <em>and</em> the blanket of stars at the same time, which we can't do on Earth because the moon is too bright.</p>
<p>In terms of the brightest moon, I agree with the other commenter that it would almost certainly be the Earth, simply because of the size of the moon, and our closeness to the Sun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to answer a different question, about which *world* has the best &quot;moonlight&quot; and I think the answer has to be Europa. It counts as a world because it's round and big enough to stand on.</p>
<p>It's tidelocked, but you can still get kinda reasonable day/night cycles every 3.5 days. If you sit on the terminator line, you can see Jupiter dominating the sky above the west pole. You can see his beautiful stormstripes going up and down. He will never move from that spot, but you can see him wax and wane every 3.5 days. He takes up 3.5 degrees of sky, 7 times more than Luna seen from earth. That gives him 50 times the apparent surface area, although the spot I've chosen leaves half of that below the horizon. He's def not a moon, but he's crescent and reflecting sunlight, so he's my main reason for picking this spot. (also radiation, volcanoes, etc.)</p>
<p>also in an westish direction you see Io's magnificent pimples. Being able to see them is my main reason for not picking Io itself. it's orbital period is  1.8 days, but since we're moving at the same times, you'll see it cross old jove every 2.7 days.</p>
<p>Rising in the west behind Jupiter's  bulk you can see ganymede and callisto rising at various times. They aren't actually moving retrograde like that, but europa has a shorter orbital period so we'll eventually overtake them, and they can set in the east.</p>
<p>There's also fifty more moons if you're the kind of person who cares about tiny dots. Also it's all pretty dark. Hopefully you have good eyes.</p>
<p>edit: jupiter is like 5 au from the sun, and it gets 1/27 as much sunlight as Luna. Because of the increased apparent area of jupiter though, it will end up being twice as bright overall as Luna(assuming both are in the same phase, crescent, gibbous, full etc.), although half of that is hiding below the horizon. If you want it brighter, move closer to the west pole and let that ominous bulk hang above you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I did not expect many people to notice it but I <em>was</em> expecting to have a good conversation. I wanted to know the answer because I have recently been daydreaming about standing on the surface of some planet and looking at the night sky filled with huge moons. Then I thought let's get real and find out if such a place is possible irl...</p>
<p>Thanks for the awards...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
