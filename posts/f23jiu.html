		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Civil engineer here. For old buildings, if they have the architectural plans then they can usually derive all the mathematical info they need and account for decayed members. If they don’t, they’ll try to generate one and usually schedule renovation. That’s mainly for old buildings like houses. Bridges can be tested for a variety of factors - they use a lot of deflection analysis, so like seeing how much a bridge will sag under a given load, or how much it’s cables (assuming suspension bridge) extend under that load. A lot of visual analysis occurs as well - cracks, rusty rebar, split timbers can all indicate the current state of the structure and can be accounted for in projections of how long it will last based on modeling. Other methods can also be used to look for wear <em>inside</em> a structure, like using electrical pulses or vibration feedback on concrete. Also, because building codes are so meticulous and regulated, a good inspector can actually refer to old building manuals and practically determine from those what kind of design life a structure was built for. It’s a fine-tuned skill and one of the aspects of civil engineering that is highly valued because of the experience it requires.</p>
<p>My timber design professor was such a knowledgeable guy that he was brought in to inspect why a frame holding a very expensive painting fell, and it didn’t even take him long to figure it out. </p>
<p>Honestly it’s pretty cool. Good question!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a Civil Engineer too from Brazil, let me just mention something.</p>
<p>It's very usual here to have old buildings which you haven't got the structural plans to, and you can't guarantee the original builder followed the codes of the time (they don't even follow it now.)</p>
<p>So one technique that's particularly interesting to test the strength of the concrete is that you can cut a cilinder out of a few columns (there are places in the column that you can do this safely) and test that cilinder's strength on a concrete press. This tells you how strong the concrete is, and you can close the hole with stronger concrete later.</p>
<p>This is called destructive testing, and there are many non-destructive methods available, but this is a fairly straightforward as many labs would have a concrete press.</p>
<p>Of course this doesn't cover the steel reinforcement, but as was already said that can be evaluated by other techniques.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
