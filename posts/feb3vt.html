When theres a bleeder, the dr will call us to say they need emergency o negs- which we give without cross matching. They try to get us a sample as quickly as possible. Getting a blood type can take me about 45 seconds, and doing a full type, antibody screen, and crossmatch will take a good 20-25 minutes in a trauma situation (there are safe shortcuts I can take to shave off some time). I'm the one who finds out the blood type and selects the blood the patient gets.</p>
<p>As for how they know how much to give and when to stop in that situation, I'm not sure! Out of my scope of practice. Good question though!!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Patients who rapidly lose blood are given O negative blood (O negative is considered the universal donor) as no matter what blood type a patient has, they can always have O negative blood without rejecting it.</p>
<p>A formal &quot;crossmatch&quot; of blood has a turn around time of approximately 1 hour when done urgently, and this may not be feasible when blood is needed in less than one hour. Some common reasons for needing blood faster than one hour would be a big trauma or a massive gastrointestinal bleed.</p>
<p>Estimating blood loss is done through history taking (e.g. patients or paramedics may have attempted to quantify the amount of blood lost) and by looking at the patient's haemoglobin level (generally a transfusion is done when haemoglobin is less then 70g/L, but when there is active, ongoing blood loss the haemoglobin number is less relevant). One bag of packed red blood cells would be expected to increase haemoglobin by 10g/L approximately. </p>
<p>When patients are having a massive bleed, a hospital's blood bank will usually activate a &quot;massive transfusion protocol&quot; where they ensure there are enough blood products allocated to the patient, and in these scenarios patients will receive packed red blood cells (the standard &quot;blood transfusion&quot; That people understand) as well as platelets and fresh frozen plasma, often at a ratio of 4:1:1, to prevent dilution of their whole blood composition by the massive transfusion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As has been mentioned most hospitals will have a massive transfusion protocol/ critical bleed policy - this will vary somewhat between institutions due to resources, for example your facility may not have ease of access to say platelets.  </p>
<p>These protocols are used for time critical/life threatening situations where the patient is going to die if you don’t start giving blood immediately, as well as controlling your source.</p>
<p>The safest option for the greatest amount of people is O negative blood.  Blood from the patient will be x-matched and when known, that blood will instead be used if possible.  It is one of the situations in emergency medicine that we take the risk because the other, rapidly approaching option, is death.</p>
<p>As to how much is lost and how much to give this can be measured via the patients vital signs, other blood results- haemoglobin, haematocrit etc..  and whether the source of bleeding is controlled.  </p>
<p>Various MTP’s suggest differing ratios of blood products, packed cells to plasma products to platelets.  This is because simply “filling” a patient with straight up O neg packed red cells is insufficient, they lack clotting agents, for example, which will worsen the patients ability to compensate and essentially what you put in will be straight back out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctor here. Figuring out how much blood needs to be transfused is easy, you generally don’t have to figure out exactly how much was lost. If they lost blood and blood pressure is low or heart rate is high you give blood until those normalize (and/or until hemoglobin level is &gt;7.0). If they are actively bleeding you raise BP to 90/xx, the bare minimum, until someone fixes the hole, because any higher and they will just bleed it out faster. </p>
<p>Blood comes in units and comes in a variety of different types. We don’t usually transfuse a unit of whole blood, it is processed into its components which can be given separately. To raise the hemoglobin level by 1 point you generally give 1 unit of packed red blood cells. In other situations you can give platelets or fresh frozen plasma (no cells but all the enzymes and clotting factors). In cases of truly massive hemorrhage that is not fixed with the first unit of pRBCs you begin giving a unit of each product to keep things balanced.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surgeon here and I'll leave the type of blood to others to explain.</p>
<p>As for how much blood to give, we mainly base this on hemodynamic instability in the setting of blood loss.  This means that we look at vital signs (heart rate and blood pressure mainly) and base blood transfusion on this.  If we can somewhat normalize your blood pressure and heart rate with blood transfusions, we've given enough blood.</p>
<p>However, we don't give whole blood much anymore, although several studies from the military show that this is the best way to replace blood loss.  Instead, blood is broken down into red blood cells, platelets, and plasma.  Red blood cells are called packed red blood cells (PRBCs) with 1 unit coming from 1 unit of whole blood and being enough to raise your hemoglobin by 1.  Platelets can be confusing as 1 unit is actually a 6-pack (usually, not all blood banks do things the same) which means it contains platelets derived from 6 different whole blood units.  Plasma is call fresh frozen plasma (FFP) with 1 unit coming from 1 unit of whole blood.  In a massive transfusion situation (patient is dying from massive blood loss, also known as exsanguination), studies from the military show that a 1 to 1 to 1 ratio (1 unit PRBCs, 1/6 unit of platelets, and 1 unit of FFP) is best because we don't just need to replace the PRBCs (which provide the capacity to carry oxygen).  We also need to replace the ability to clot so the wounds can stop bleeding out whatever we put in (platelets provide a scaffold and FFP has clotting factors which help build the clot).</p>
<p>Side note: in addition to giving blood products, we need to stop the big bleeders or the blood won't have a chance to clot.  This is done usually through surgery (remove the shattered spleen, sew up the torn blood vessels, repair the liver, etc) or intravascular procedures to block blood vessels (interventional radiology usually does this and usually is for pelvic venous bleeding only in the emergency setting although can also be used in other areas).  We also need to keep the patient warm and prevent their blood from becoming too acidotic as all the platelets and clotting factors in the world won't work if they're not at 'normal' temperature and pH (the 'Lethal Triad' is coagulopathy, hypothermia, and acidosis).</p>
<p>Back to how much blood to give, we should also be careful not to give too much blood product as it can actually cause immunosuppression, can run us out of blood products (thus preventing us from giving blood to those without blood loss but who need products due to elective surgery or medical issues), and is expensive.</p>
<p>There's a lot more to this than what I just went through, but I'll stop there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
