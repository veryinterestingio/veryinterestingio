		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/10/101006131203.htm" target="_blank">this study,</a> yes.  They put stereo headphones on 12 sighted people and 12 blind people and had them point to where they thought the sound was, all the while under an MRI.  In the blind the visual cortex showed more activity than it it did in the sighted.  They did the same experiment, but instead of stereo headphones they used electric vibrators on each finger and had the participants tell them which finger was stimulated.  Again under the MRI.  The blind participants showed more activity in the visual cortex than the sighted people.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;That tells us that the visual cortex in the blind takes on these functions and processes sound and tactile information which it doesn't do in the sighted,&quot; he says. &quot;The neural cells and fibers are still there and still functioning, processing spatial attributes of stimuli, driven not by sight but by hearing and touch. This plasticity offers a huge resource for the blind.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oliver Sacks had a case where a person who was essentially blind, he could only pick up vague light/dark, his entire life.  He eventually got surgery that gave him sight for the first time.  He couldn't interpret anything he saw.  He could close his eyes and determine he was holding an orange but open his eyes and he had no idea what it was.  He couldn't determine the edges of things, perspective, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, apparently, blind people can  comprehend speech sped up to 2.5 times faster than the maximum rate that non-blind people can understand. They use parts of their brain for processing sound that non-blind people use for visual processing.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Usually repurposed to auditory and somatosensory cortex, and more according <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/08/28/402321.full.pdf" target="_blank">to this study</a> and its references:<br />
&quot;The auditory cortices of deaf individuals respond to visual stimuli and the visual cortices of blind individuals respond to sound and touch, a phenomenon termed cross-modal plasticity (Sadato et al. 1996; Cohen et al. 1997; BÃ¼chel et al. 1998; Bavelier and Neville 2002; Collignon et al. 2011; Watkins et al. 2013; Almeida et al. 2015).</p>
<p>Even without handicap, the cortex with its limited surface is the place of competition between functions. The zones in the motor cortex of a professional violinist will be larger than the average people's; if you spend all day writing texts with your thumb, the area controlling said finger will grow... to the detriment of everything else.<br />
