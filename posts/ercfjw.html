		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Did a little testing with my <a href="http://www.p3international.com/products/p4400.html" target="_blank">Kill-a-Watt</a> meter.  Here's the power consumed when the charger is not plugged in to a device:</p>
<p><strong>Modern &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switched-mode_power_supply" target="_blank">switching</a>&quot; power supplies:</strong></p>
<p>Cheap 10 watt <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charger-Adapter-Ailkin-Replacement-Samsung/dp/B074WMR749" target="_blank">USB wall charger</a>: <strong>0 watts</strong></p>
<p>Older 6 watt <a href="https://www.amazon.com/1-35mm-Power-Adapter-V-Infinity-EPS060100-P7P/dp/B074JXWSVG" target="_blank">power adapter</a>: <strong>0.3 watts</strong></p>
<p>Modern 87 watt <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-USB-C-Power-Adapter-MacBook/dp/B01M8O7W40" target="_blank">Macintosh USB-C laptop charger</a>: <strong>0 watts</strong></p>
<p><strong>Older <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer" target="_blank">transformer</a>-based power supply:</strong></p>
<p>6 V 3.6 watt &quot;wall wart&quot; transformer: <strong>1.5 W</strong> (40%!!). </p>
<p>So the answer varies, but usage is basically zero for all power supplies that used modern &quot;switched-mode&quot; technology.  The advice about wastefulness of these adapters probably comes from the old-school transformer-based adapters, which are much, much more wasteful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I haven't measured it, but it is less significantly less than one Watt. The reason is that it has to convert the 50/60 Hertz at 120/240 Volts to a low DC Voltage. That requires several steps each of which uses some power because every circuit has  resistance (except superconductors). The AC outlet consumes no power when nothing is plugged in because no current is flowing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned, the legal limit in the EU is now 0.5 Watts. In practice it may be lower.</p>
<p>The power supply itself is connected and powered. Switched-mode power supplies use microprocessors to control themselves, so even when there's no load the processor will still be using power, but very little. Linear power supplies, which are an older type, have a transformer directly connected to the AC supply and this will always be dissipating power even with no load.</p>
<p>Rule of thumb: If a charger is not warm to the touch, it's not wasting much power. If a charger is quite heavy and bulky considering what it powers, and tends to get warm, it's likely to be a linear power supply.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>There is no one answer. Each circuit, supply, usage, and even temperature will have different losses. Worst-case, however, this is generally measured in milliwatts. The quality of the charger may have an effect here as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And why does the power leak in the first place if the circuit is not completed?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The circuit <em>is</em> completed. An AC-DC switching converter (what most &quot;chargers&quot; are) is not a simple circuit. In addition to physical devices being lossy by default, there are feedback paths that may leak, or even ICs that stay powered on to control the voltage when something <em>is</em> plugged in.</p>
<p>A charger is not an extension cord, it's a device in it's own right.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the same effect occur with the power socket in the wall?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not normally, no. A standard socket does not contain any electrical components, just contacts. However, most &quot;smart&quot; outlets will definitely draw power even when nothing is plugged in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
