		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a large part of the Fermi Paradox. The galaxy is only about 100,000 light years across, so even at 1% of the speed of light, it takes 10 million years to cross the galaxy. We evolved from small mammals to tool-using humans with space rockets over less than 100 million years. The invention of writing to the Apollo Program is maybe 10,000 years or less. All of these time-scales are much shorter than the age of the Earth, let alone the universe. This means that if life intelligent evolved anywhere else within the galaxy, it's unlikely that it appeared at the same time as us - it's almost certain that any intelligent life would be millions of years more advanced or millions of years less advanced.</p>
<p>This tells us that galaxy-colonising advanced life must be rare, as if there is intelligent life that has the capability and intent to colonise the galaxy, anywhere within the galaxy, anywhere in the past X million or billion years, they should have reached Earth a very long time ago.</p>
<p>Of course, there are multiple reasons why galaxy-colonising advanced life might be rare.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>they lack the intent, i.e. they could colonise the galaxy, but they choose not to leave their home planet, or they do explore the galaxy but leave us alone (basically the Zoo hypothesis)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they lack the ability, i.e. even with millions of years of advancement it's not practical to leave a solar system in mass migrations, or a more advanced society generally becomes more at risk of destroying itself before it reaches that stage (&quot;the great filter&quot;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>intelligent</em> life is rare. Life has thrived on Earth for billions of years before one species developed spaceflight. Evolution doesn't inevitably lead towards developing life that can invent advanced technology. There may be many planets out there full of animals and plants, or even just bacteria, but it's possible that humanity is a bit of a freak accident.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>life is rare in general. We don't really know how common life is. We know the ingredients seem to be fairly abundant, but how often do these combine to make something we would reasonably call &quot;life&quot;?</p>
</li>
<li>the conditions for life are rare. However, as we discover more and more exoplanets, it looks like there are quite a few planets that seem like they would be hospitable to life, so this is less of a factor than we used to think.</li>
</ul>
<p>So this isn't really a &quot;paradox&quot; in the common sense, because there are many ways to resolve it. But each of the resolutions involves stuff we just don't know - we don't know how frequently life evolves in the right conditions, we don't know how frequently life evolves to form intelligent space-faring species, and we don't know how often a space-faring space faring species would have the intent and capability to explore the galaxy. Any of these are plausible, and it could easily be a combination of everything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what others have said, the &quot;observable&quot; part of the universe is the limit of what we will ever be able to receive light/information from. Since dark energy is pushing things further and further apart, the longer time goes on the more and more galaxies will be inaccessible to us forever and any intelligent life in it. Forbes did an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ethansiegel/2015/06/08/dark-energy-renders-97-of-the-galaxies-in-our-observable-universe-permanently-unreachable/?sh=f80765983193" target="_blank">article</a> where they say 97% of the galaxies IN our observable universe are inaccessible to use even if we left today at the speed of light. This greatly reduces the amount of volume a potential intelligent civilization would be able to exist in and still be able to interact with. So for all we know there is life out there.. somewhere.. we'd just never be able to know.</p>
<p>So to recap, take the entire diameter of the universe estimated at 93 billion light-years. Then the observable universe 46.5 billion light-years. Then about 3% of that. That's what we're able to interact with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

They may not know how to detect our signals yet. We may not know how to detect their signals yet. They may not know how to send signals yet. They may not be sending signals anymore. They may not want to be found. They may be extinct. </p>
<p>The variables in answering whether or not we're alone are astounding. There's no reason to expect to find anything even if it's out there. On the cosmological timeline we have only existed for like 5 minutes, and we've only been looking for 5 seconds. </p>
<p>It would be like if there was one fire fly someone on earth that only lit up once for a quarter of a second once every three days. We glance out our window for half a second and don't see it. What are we supposed to conclude from that? </p>
<p>Humans have a long ways to go before they can detect alien life. Hell, we're still discovering new species of life right here on earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how old the universe is, I don't think you know how big it is.</p>
<p>Our Galaxy, the Milky Way, is 100,000 light years in diameter. It would take at least 100,000 years to get a message from one side of the galaxy to the other.</p>
<p>How long have humans been building stuff capable of receiving messages that move at light speed, like radio waves? Well, the Radio was invented some 120 years ago. So in 100,000 years, the radio waves we give off from our civilizations will start to reach the far end of our Galaxy. That is just our galaxy of course. Andromeda, the nearest large Galaxy to ours, is some 2.5 million light years away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
