More popular videos like new movie trailers, giant viral hits, or trending stuff that Google wants you to watch may also be hosted on those servers, but Ads are always 'gold tier' because they drive revenue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>YouTube servers aren't just in one location. They have bunches of smaller server locations scattered around the world so if you want to view something you don't necessarily need to have it brought out of the central archives across the world. Instead the most popular stuff is kept cached in local nodes where they can be delivered to you very quickly.</p>
<p>While a lot of people will be viewing the most popular videos there is other traffic which is entirely unpredictable. Perhaps whatever video you wanted to see is located across the world and that takes time to access. Advertisements however are usually locally targeted, making the most of advertising dollars, which means they are going to be present on local servers. <em>Everyone</em> gets the same sort of ads in their videos while the actual content of the video might be anything and take longer to be found.</p>
<p>To make an analogy imagine you come to an auto parts store. They have many racks of thousands of different parts behind the counter and a computer to look them up. When you ask for an arbitrary piece the employee needs to find out where it is kept and go get it, which will take some time. Depending on where it is it might take quite a while. However this store also has a stack of fliers which is kept on the front counter. Everyone gets a flier with their purchase so it is kept handy, and there is no mystery why it is always quick to access compared to other parts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Youtube has a rather intelligent structure where the most viewed videos are stored on different servers with more capacity. </p>
<p>Naturally, Adds are also on these high performance servers, its not only money, but virtually every user gets to see them. It makes sense for them to be there.</p>
<p>The content you want to watch, has a very real chance of not being on these servers</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On the contrary, even the ads load badly for me on a bad connection. Sometimes it takes like 5 minutes to get past a 15 second ad because youtube forces them to load in 1080p HD. When I can only stream 480p buffering here and there. It's why I don't do YouTube on my phone. Ad block is a necessity </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
