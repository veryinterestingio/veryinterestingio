		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was printing and binding an environmental impact report for a customer today, and one of the pages that caught my eye as I was flipping through had a <a href="https://imgur.com/a/STrTFSx" target="_blank">table</a> of &quot;Significant historical earthquakes in Northern California.&quot;  All but three of them occurred in 1906 or earlier, including the three largest; a 7.8 in 1906 (the one that decimated San Francisco, I'm assuming), a 7.4 in 1838, and a 7 in 1868.  The Richter scale wasn't invented until the 1930s.</p>
<p>So how do we know what magnitude they were, even if it's an estimated range like they show on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_earthquakes_in_California" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> for some of the more notable California earthquakes rather than an exact number?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These earlier magnitudes are estimated based on a variety of methods, including historical records ( people reporting damage, shaking intensity, building collapses etc, how far it was felt) and by measuring physical evidence available today of the earthquake impact e.g. sediment slumps, fault offset, tsunami deposits, landslides, etc. </p>
<p>In short, by measuring effects from modern day quakes, you can start reconstructing older quakes</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The question confuses the existence of a <em>scale</em> with the existence of an instrument for <em>measuring</em> the quantity that the scale puts into numbers. You may have been thrown by the word &quot;scale&quot; as in &quot;set of scales&quot; but the Richter scale is a <em>numerical</em> scale, not a measuring instrument.</p>
<p>The kilogram was not invented until the 1790s, but that poses no issue at all for writing down historical weights in kilograms today, so long as we have an accurate record of the weight in some other unit - some other scale - whose value we still know today.</p>
<p>In the case of earthquakes the instrument required to measure magnitude is the seismometer. Versions of seismometers have existed for centuries. Other ways of recording the strength of an earthquake involve observing the effects or reading the statements of people who witnessed it. Early seismometers and these other methods are not as accurate at measuring the energy released by a quake as a modern seismometer, but that doesn't mean that an estimate cannot be produced and translated into the scale we use today.</p>
<p>Note that the table you linked does not actually use the Richter scale, it uses the Moment Magnitude scale, which was developed in the 1970s. Some translation also has to be done from the Richter scale to the modern scale. All of this is possible, to the extent that the instruments were accurate and the relationship between the old and new scales is understood. (In practice Mw was developed to match up well with the Richter scale at typical values).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I went to a talk about our local geology and the geologists showed us how they estimated the size of prehistoric earthquakes by the amount of displacement along the fault they had excavated. It was pretty interesting. For the historical ones they also used written descriptions of the damage done to buildings as a factor. Even though Nevada hasn't had a lot of earthquakes recently, we've apparently had some pretty big ones in the past.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
