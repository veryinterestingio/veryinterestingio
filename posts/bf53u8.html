		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well lets start with how we see (or at least our rough understanding). Photoreceptors are cells in the retina that detect incoming photons, when they are exposed to light, they become inactive (surprising, I know). Neurons sense the activity of these photoreceptors, and compare them to their neighbour, and depending on the type of neuron, either become active if the photoreceptor is less active, or more active than it's neighbours, producing on-center and off-center activity patterns, i.e. the response when the retina is seeing a bright point surrounded by darkness, or a dark point, surrounded by light. By the time this activity gets to the first stop in the visual cortex, AKA V1, this information is summed up so that the neurons respond to lines, and lines of a particular orientation.... (think about how lots of on-center responses stacked up side by side would look, like <a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.brains-explained.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/simple-cell-model.jpg?resize=1024%2C641" target="_blank">this</a>).</p>
<p>Take a second to think: we've gone through about 5 cells by now, from the photoreceptor in the retina, to the first neurons in V1, and the brain has already gone from sensing points of lights to lines.</p>
<p>Our belief is that neurons in the next area might sum up the input of those cells in V1 to respond to more complex features... and by the time you get deep into the visual system, you have neurons that only respond to the face of one person, perhaps your grandmother, or perhaps <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7567-why-your-brain-has-a-jennifer-aniston-cell/" target="_blank">Jennifer Aniston</a>. This is our basic idea for how all sensory processing is done in the brain: simple features which respond directly to the raw sensory input are summed up into more and more complex, and behaviorally relevant features: lines become faces, frequencies become words, chemicals become odors. </p>
<p>So, with all that: what does that have to do with dreaming? On one hand we know a lot about dreaming, but on the other hand, we know very little. But what we do know is that the brain becomes active during dreams, and &quot;replays&quot; meaningful patterns of activity. We also know that the same neurons deep in the visual pathway become active, and the activity of those neurons is related to what we perceive during our dreams. How do those neurons become active during dreams? We don't know. Why are the active? We don't know. </p>
<p>So to really sum it up, using the parlance of your question, the light that illuminates our dreams comes from within our brain, but from which parts, we aren't sure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question gets even more interesting when you consider how blind people dream. And then theres the question of color. I have had lucid dreams that were in monochrome, and then on different occasions had lucid dreams that featured very specific colors. Other dreams included smell, but only rarely.</p>
<p>One of my most interesting dream &quot;glitches&quot; was of a family member, where he might as well have been a cardboard cutout with the word &quot;brother&quot; in block letter. (Not literally what I dreampt, that was just the way I remembered that dream symbol). Contrast with other dreams where the guy's &quot;brother&quot; characteristic was a barely remenbered bit of trivia, and it was his face and mannerisims that distinguished him.</p>
<p>I imagine that when I have these sort of lopsided dreams, it's parts of my perceptual machinery becoming activated while leaving other parts dormant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is huge debate over whether seeing and imagining things (as in dreaming) utilize the same neural mechanisms or not. One of my favorite quotes, by Steven la Berge is (roughly, from memory), “dreaming is thinking unconstrained by sensory input.” Of course it’s also thinking without a lot of executive function and other things, but you get the point</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
