<p>They do have data that shows testosterone causes male vocal cords to grow 63% </p>
<p>Here's a book on it too<br />

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't quite say much with regards to humans, but as an owner of ferrets one of the interesting facts about them is all ferrets in, at least in Canada, legally must be Spayed/Neutered.</p>
<p>This has interesting side effects, as the operation is done when the ferret is very young. One effect that has been documented well is the ferrets go through significant changes in growth and behavior.</p>
<p>Young ferrets are far more social, friendly, curious, and less aggressive. As they mature normally, they become more food dominant, aggressive, and of course sexual with each other. Normal growing ferrets will become seclusive as well.</p>
<p>However, if Neutered/Spayed, they don't go through these changes nearly as much. These ferrets, which are called 'Sprites', will basically stay in their childlike phase (temper wise) for effectively forever.</p>
<p>They also don't grow as big, and stay social. Sprites are much more cuddly, they are perfectly fine cuddling together in piles (behavior normally only seen in baby ferrets), and they continue to be playful and non-aggressive for their entire life span.</p>
<p>Now, since Ferrets and Humans are both Mammals, I wouldn't be surprised if similar phenomena occur with us as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of my Music History classes in college talked about Opera during the time that castrati were particularly common.</p>
<p>Young boys before their voice change would keep their high voice but with the thick and broad timbre of male vocal folds.</p>
<p>Castrati are also talked about in general having both masculine and feminine features. They would be slim and light of frame, but tall and very long-limbed. Likely as a result of the biological processes talked about in other comments.</p>
<p>As to desiring sex, we get to a weird spot.
Records show that during that time, we begin to see the idea of &quot;gender as a spectrum&quot;, with the <em>center</em> being the most ideal. Angels in scripture were described with neither or both genders' traits, so the castrati were seen as the closest mortals could get to godliness. Letters and records from nobles at the time also talk about how much status and renown one received for having had a sexual encounter with a castrati, Lords and Ladies alike.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
