		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a post about this back in the day, and one reason I remember being unusual had to do with the fact that spiders move by filling and draining their legs with blood in rapid succession.</p>
<p>The motion caused by this is so different from any other animal’s method of movement (I.e. tightening and loosing of muscles in a bi or quadrapedal rhythm) that animal brains find it inherently repulsive. </p>
<p>So yeah, blame the spider erection legs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's quite a few reasons actually and scientist opinions vary. Some believe that it is the erratic behavior of spiders that can scare people. Spiders, with their eight legs and sudden movements, are unpredictable to the human mind. Their &quot;legginess&quot; (i took this word from some article) is a potential factor to people's fears. Other studies have also shown that arachnophobia can be inheritable, so people's fear of spiders can be passed down to their children. Another trend is that members of the same family often develop arachnophobia together, and someone is much more likely to have a fear of spiders if someone in their family is also scared of spiders. Yet another reason is conditioning, a response caused by a past event. Maybe you or someone you know was bit. Or maybe you saw a poisonous spider scuttle past you. These kind of events can condition a fear of spiders.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There have been lots of good and helpful answers already in this thread. I was scared of spiders when I was young (I acquired the response from my elder sister) but I grew out of it and now don't mind them at all. </p>
<p>I think there are a few other contributory factors alongside all the ones that have already been mentioned. </p>
<p>For one thing, there's the fact that you can suddenly and unexpectedly encounter a spider almost anywhere. They can be on any surface, at any angle, indoors or out. Every arachnophobe has had the experience of going into a room, switching on the light and suddenly, scarily, noticing a dark spider shape on a wall or under a ledge. I remember when I was still scared of them that this was one aspect of the problem that I found extremely annoying. With most other things you might be scared of, you can (for the most part) anticipate when and where the 'danger' is likely to arise. But spiders... nope, they can be anywhere, any time.</p>
<p>Also, there's the webs. Walking into even a single strand of spider web is annoying even if you aren't scared of spiders and (see my point above) this can happen just about anywhere. If you ARE scared of them then it just feels like another annoying advantage: oh great, even when the spider itself either isn't present or can't be seen, it can leave invisible traps behind for me to suddenly walk into. That's just great. Plus larger, abandoned cobwebs just look messy and (if you have the fear) spooky and scary.</p>
<p>I think spider movement is also a factor. They seem to have two modes: utterly static, kings of do-nothing OR faster than lightning in an erratic and unpredictable way. If you're scared of something, either of these modes just adds to the fear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
