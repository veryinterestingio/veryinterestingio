<p>EDIT (4.10.19 16H11 UTC+1) :
Hi everybody, I wanted to make clear that my comment doesn't take in count every factors :
UV, alcohol, tobacco, drugs &amp; food habits can change you skin
If you are interested by this, you should read the replies of this comment, or the 2nd top comment, that perfectly explain how UV affect our skin over the time</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>UV-A radiation—that's the answer no one has given in this whole thread.</p>
<p>TL;DR at the bottom. </p>
<p>Over time you and your skin are exposed to all sorts of radiation, of which the sun's is most prominent. Of all the radiation it blasts  at us, most is blocked by our lovely atmosphere. The little UV radiation that does make it through hits your skin and slowly alters it. Specifically the UV-A type radiation is what affects the aging of the skin most. </p>
<p>How you wonder? Simple. Your skin cells reproduce, and as they do, their offspring is passed along the blueprint of how to make the next generation of cells, and so on. Radiation damages that blueprint, and although most cells will have a perfect blueprint to pass along, over time the number of cells that pass along imperfect ones become so numerous that we start seeing it with our bare eyes: wrinkles. </p>
<p>They'll contain less fat, manipulate water less well, etc., all because the blueprint they're passing along is getting blasted by light from the sun. </p>
<p>UV-B in particular is a contributor to cancer—damage to the blueprints such that the cells that read it think their instructions are to multiply fast and <em>indefinitely</em>.</p>
<p>TL;DR: the sun is blasting the DNA stored in our skin cells such that their offspring knows less well what to do over time, resulting in wrinkles, and in some cases even cancer.</p>
<p>Edit: &quot;hur dur stay inside infinitely healthy skin.&quot; No. It protects you from a lot of radiation, but not all of it. It helps a lot to stay inside, yes, but so does cream with an SPF of more than zero.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The easiest way I believe to describe it is to think of a rubber band, over time after being stretched time and time again it begins to lose its elasticity. The rubber band will begin to sag and not snap back into place. Think of your skin being stretched and moving back and forth, your cells do not produce collagen at the rate they once did so it begins to wrinkle and not snap in place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pathologist who has looked at tens of thousands of skin biopsies here. Below the epidermis layer is a curly collagen layer. It’s easy to see the fibers change into a progressively homogeneous fragmented and degraded state called solar elastic change. That’s why the snap back quality is lost!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This thread is weird. No one has answered the question yet. People have not answered <em>why</em> we wrinkle, only <em>how</em>. </p>
<p>Given that - as OP points out - we don't start wrinkling until after childhood, that we often wrinkle far more/earlier in the face <em>and</em> the fact that our skin can easily regenerate after a wound, it leaves you wondering why that is. </p>
<p>I haven't looked into any of this my self but I imagine that it would be an evolutionary advantage to be able to easily recognize the age of other individuals not the least the age of potential mates.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
