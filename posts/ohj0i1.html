<p>However you can also add a #inner-page-link to the end of a url to specify locations within a page too, so you might naturally navigate around a page like this and pressing back would move you backwards in those same steps.</p>
<p>In modern browsers, developers are also able to manually modify the browser history as well -- although sketchy actors have been finding ways to keep you stuck on a page for decades.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Someone already mentioned the concept, but I feel it merits mentioning the usual culprit is called a redirect. When you get redirected sometimes the change happens instantly and you are back to the top of the page like it was just loaded. </p>
<p>The purpose of a redirect page is to send you to another page. A developer might do this for several reasons, but the most common place you’ll find redirects is advertising. As a basic example, imagine you click on a Random Company advertisement from a webpage. You click the ad expecting it to take you directly to the product page for Random Companies product but it actually takes you to the company that hosted the ad first. That company reads where you came from, what ad you clicked on and based on that information sends you to Random Company’s website. </p>
<p>Then when you try to click back, you just go to the redirect page which sends you back to Random Company’s page. This effectively looks like you just went back to the top of the page. Companies will actually do this several times intentionally in order to “trap” users on a page for a few more seconds. This increases the chance you’ll actually look at the product and it makes their advertising services look better to their client. More time on the website = More likely to buy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I could be wrong here, but I don't think the behaviour OP is asking about has actually been described. Many have mentioned how your browser maintains a history of URLs you've visited, but all modern browsers now also remember the last scroll position of that site.</p>
<p>Using Wikipedia as an example, if you scroll down a page (without clicking <del>and</del> any internal links), then if you click on a link to another Wikipedia article, the browser will remember the scroll position of that page you came from. Now when you hit your browser's back button, it will take you back to that page at that scrolled position.</p>
<p>I believe there is now a way for developers to prevent this default behaviour, which can be useful for sites with a lot of dynamic content or infinite scroll, etc. It works best with static pages that can be cached.</p>
<p>As for why it happens on some sites on not others, could be just the way the site loads the content dynamically does not work with the browser's scroll position history feature. Or it could be the case that the site is handling scroll position changes itself.</p>
<p>At least I think that's what you were really asking about.  </p>

<p>Like on wikipedia if you click on a link in the table of contents, it takes you to another place of that page using an anchor link, and when you press the back button it just takes you back to the table of contents.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
