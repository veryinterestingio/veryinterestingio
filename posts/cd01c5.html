		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s unsustainable, basically.   This is kinda like asking why you don’t sprint everywhere - it’s faster, isn’t it?   Because it’s <em>exhausting</em>, and you wouldn’t be able to keep it up.  </p>
<p>Our bodies aren’t designed to be running at absolute maximum capacity like that.   The adrenaline surge is an emergency measure, designed to get us out of trouble if we need it.  Very useful if you need a burst of speed to avoid a lion, or extra strength to wrestle a fallen tree off your toddler, but you don’t need that when you’re playing video games or hanging out at the pool.   </p>
<p>It is also pretty damaging to be in that state.   Adrenaline is not good for you, not long-term.   There is actually a maximum amount of time you can sustain the heightened state of adrenaline before it tapers off - even if the situation hasn’t changed.   This is because you run out of adrenaline, and also because your body literally cannot maintain the high alert state for more than a few hours <em>max</em>.   There is a longer-term, less extreme stress hormone called cortisol that takes over if the stressful situation is lasting longer than that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because adrenaline also is very unhealthy. It increases blood pressure, heart rate, and puts you in a state of flight or fight. You may also get palpitations or skipped heartbeats.</p>
<p>Being like that 24/7 will increase your anxiety to the point where you won't be able to function well.</p>
<p>Furthermore, adrenaline is like a drug. Adreneline junkies exist. And much like other drugs, they have to keep doing more and more crazy and dangerous stuff to feel the same 'rush' as normal people.</p>
<p>So our MINDS will eventually stop responding to it, but all those other factors don't.</p>
<p>So yeah. P bad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR at bottom (you can skip it if you don't prefer technicalities)</p>
<p>Adrenaline is a vasocontrictor- basically decreases diameter of blood vessels where blood is not required at the time of emergencies (like, digestive system, skin, etc.)</p>
<p>Sustained vasoconstriction increases blood pressure- leading to hypertension.</p>
<p>Moreover, it leads to increased heart beat- increased load on heart, susceptiblity to skipped beats (arrhythmias), and even atherosclerosis (plaque in arteries)</p>
<p>Having it 24x7 in the brain would induce lots of anxiety, to the point of paranoia and/or psychoses.</p>
<p>Increased pressure on blood vessels may lead to
1) rupture- as in stroke
2) kidney failure
3) retinopathy (blindness)</p>
<p>and a lot more.</p>
<p>TL;DR: It induces changes which can be withstood only for a short period of time without irreversible damage. So, bad for long term.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For an example of why you wouldn't want adrenaline constantly being released at high levels, look up pheochromocytoma. This is a problem where an adrenaline secretion tumor does exactly what you have suggested. Instead of a super human, you get  high blood pressure, headache, sweating, high heart rate, high blood sugar (which can become diabetes), and anxiety (sometimes described as an impending sense of doom or panic attacks). </p>
<p>Elevated adrenaline is useful in short bursts in specific situations, but outside of that it is not going to feel good or make someone super human.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
