		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the gap in your understanding is that herd immunity doesn't stop the disease existing, it just represents the mathematical steady-state of the disease in the human population. Keeping that steady state requires continual new infections.</p>
<p>Estimates of smallpox r0 are 3.5-6, so we are looking at something like 80% of the population needing prior exposure to prevent epidemics.</p>
<p>When herd immunity keeps the disease moderately suppressed, you have a growing wave of children with limited immunity who are fresh fuel for the disease; they will facilitate an outbreak eventually.</p>
<p>I imagine 400k/yr fatalities represented the long-term-average, steady-state burn of smallpox in the population to keep it just sub-epidemic.</p>
<p>PS. smallpox had a fatality rate of 30% (and surviving it wasn't exactly fun), so unlike chickenpox people are not going to try and catch this deliberately...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Herd immunity is something of a misnomer. We really ought to be talking about herd protection, to which herd immunity is a best case limiting behavior.</p>
<p>Let's imagine a simplified case of a disease where for every person that gets it they transmit it to two other people. At the very beginning of the outbreak an exponential model will be a good fit, and as long as the number of people who aren't immune is less than half the population the disease is likely to continue to spread (assuming no measures are taken to slow the spread). But as soon as the disease has infected half the population (assuming they can't be reinfected) then every other person won't be infected, so every person that gets it transmits it to one other person. By the time 75% of the population is infected the odds are one in two that any given infected person will infect another. This breaks the chain of transmission, and makes it unlikely for the disease to spread. That's herd protection. If 99.9999% of the population are immune, then it's extremely unlikely for the disease to spread. That's herd immunity.</p>
<p>So we didn't ever really have herd immunity against smallpox, we had herd protection. When large parts of the population stop being possible vectors for the disease, it makes it hard for the disease to spread, but only in a probabilistic sense. There might be some community where few people are immune. Or a community with plenty of immune people might just get unlucky.</p>
<p>A further complication is that a disease can reach a kind of equilibrium. I spoke above about some imagined disease where each infected person infects two others. This (ignoring things like how long it takes to recover) can be expressed by the differential equation dI/dT = 2I, i.e. that the change in the number of infected per time period T is equal to two times the number of people currently infected, and as mentioned this has the exponential solution I(t) \~ e^(t). But if half the population is immune so that every sick person only infects one person before they themselves recover then ΔI/ΔT = 0, which has the constant solution I(t) \~ c. And if the infection rate is lower then the birth rate then you'll be introducing new people into the population who aren't immune at a lower rate then people are being immunized.</p>
<p>Taken together - the fact that the spread of a disease is inherently probabilistic, and the fact that diseases can reach an equilibrium in the population - means that you can have a disease continually transmitting itself throughout the population while occasionally experiencing major outbreaks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Herd immunity is a statistical concept. No one is born immune to any specific disease, although we have immune systems to fight disease.   Herd immunity works best with very contagious diseases with low fatality. No one &quot;gets immune&quot; through herd immunity. It is just that the more people who have survived the disease makes it less likely for people who are vulnerable to the disease (babies, immune compromised folks) to contact people with the disease and are less likely to get it. Diseases like small pox are very lethal and contagious, The faster a diease kills people, the less they can spread it. So outbreaks of these diseases is sporatic and actually easier to control. SARSCoV-2 (COVID) is clearly contagious. It has a low lethality, but higher that influenza and some other diseases we already know about. It just jumped to humans in the last seven months, so we really don't know specifically what will happen with this one. Immunity sometimes stays long term and sometimes it wanes. We just don't know. We are using our experiences with other viruses with similar (but not identical) charactersitics to help us make decisions about how to handle this virus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
