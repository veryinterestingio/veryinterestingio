		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what you mean by personality traits. If you mean very general, wide ranging orientations, then probably not. The most widely used, and best validated, of the personality inventories is the <a href="https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~johnlab/bigfive.htm" target="_blank">Big Five</a>, and results for any one person are pretty stable, and pretty predictive for certain life outcomes (its everything the Myers-Briggs wishes it were). However, the <em>expression</em> of your personality trait might change. Consider the APA's <a href="https://www.apa.org/about/policy/violent-video-games" target="_blank">Resolution on Violent Video Games</a>, noting the difference between <em>aggression</em> and <em>violence</em>. Someone with a predisposition towards aggressiveness might become violent, or they might become a great linebacker. So even if you somehow measure someone's aggressiveness, you don't necessarily know what that means for their actual behavior (notwithstanding possibly valid and reliable tests for violence).</p>
<p>As far as I know, there's not much research into something that specific. In fact there's not all that much that's agreed upon in personality psychology; even the idea of &quot;personality traits&quot; as a construct is objected to by some. Personality is probably about the most complex thing we could measure about a person, and psychometrics is <em>very</em> difficult.</p>
<p>Actually measuring the thing we want to measure (which is usually called construct validity, or just validity) depends on the test plus how well defined the thing is. So just think about everything we refer to when we just want to measure something like &quot;happiness&quot;. Are they friendly? Non-assertive? Are they unconcerned with 'deep' things? How would we measure those things? And what even is happiness, is it different from contentment? Does it really matter? It's a huge question!</p>
<p>But when we talk about personality, we not only have to go through many huge questions, we have to figure out what <em>personality</em> is, and what questions are appropriate. So is how someone takes their coffee a personality trait? In some conception, maybe. But in terms of how willing they are to try new coffee drinks? That's the kind of thing that is measured by the Big Five, and probably does predict how likely you are, at some point, to change how you take your coffee.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
