<p>It's called an <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterimage" target="_blank">afterimage</a>. Staring at a bright light for a long oeriod will eventually damage your eyes and you'll have a permanent afterimage called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_snow" target="_blank">visual snow</a> and may take weeks, months, years or even not at all if damage is severe enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Optometrist here: Seems well covered already but it is due to the “bleaching” of retinal photoreceptors in any particular area.  Each photo receptor has a stack of membrane disks which are covered in photopigments of different types called Rhodopsins.  Each time a Rhodopsin molecule absorbs light it “flips” causing an electrical impulse down the membrane by way of a cascade it sends the signal down the rod/cone to a complicated chain of cells and cell processing which becomes quickly less relevant to this conversation.  The disks are slowly “consumed” and moved Down the rod/cone until it can be shed and absorbed by the retinal pigment epithelium layer for reabsorption.  When an area is bleached relative to another area the signal becomes muted as the cells regenerate (can take up to 5 seconds for most people longer if problems exist).  The after image can last longer if a very intense stimulus (like a bright light) were to bleach the area.  Sufficiently intense lights such as the sun simply burn a hole through the nerves causing permanent damage which you can not recover from.  We refer to this as “solar retinopathy”.  I have also seen cases where laser pointers have caused retinal burns.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The photoreceptors in your eyes detect light using chemicals that degrade in the presence of certain light. Staring at a bright object for a short time, or a dim object for a longer time, causes more of the chemical to degrade, and takes longer for the chemical to subsequently regenerate. </p>
<p>Translating the images your eye sees into something your brain can interpret involves each photoreceptors checking to see if it's chemicals have been degraded, not directly checking to see if you are actively looking at an object. Therefore, an afterimage can stick around even once you look away or close your eyes. The term 'burn' used in reference to afterimages is completely different than the regular definition of a burn. An image can be 'burned in' to your retina as described.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lotta comments here explaining why we see an afterimage when we close our eyes - as for why the &quot;outline&quot; might appear brighter than the rest of the object, this is because our eyes are actually able to accentuate lines and edges within our field of vision. This is because the information sent by any particular location on the retina actually results from a patch of sensory cells, containing both light-excitable and light-inhibitable cells. They are arranged such that an area of contrasting brightness (e.g. an edge or a line causes by a real life object) will result in a higher signal intensity, meaning that the edges of an object appear brighter to us than the area within it's borders.
This is quite useful since lines and edges are important features for helping us discern what's in our field of vision, where objects stop and start, more important than say, the middle of where an object is. Looking at power lines is good for observing what I'm talking about. Not only does this give a longer-lasting after image to the borders of objects, but the after image is often observable even without closing your eyes by just move your eyes elsewhere.
