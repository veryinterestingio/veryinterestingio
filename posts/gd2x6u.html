		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's complicated, and seems to have as much to do with psychology as biology or chemistry.</p>
<p>First of all, the question is why <em>any</em> liquor burns when you drink it. The answer boils down to the fact that it triggers a particular receptor in your mouth and throat. This receptor -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPV1" target="_blank">TRVP1</a>, for anyone looking for a little more than an ELI5 -- is responsible for a bunch of sensations. When something in your mouth is too hot, this little beastie tells your body that something is fucky and you need to <em>hashahashafashaha</em> until it cools down. However, it's <em>also</em> triggered by capsaicin (the thing that makes spicy food spicy) and by ethanol (the thing that makes booze feel so good until it <em>suddenly doesn't</em>). Ethanol affects it slightly differently, however; it makes it more sensitive to <em>other</em> stimuli, rather than directly stimulating it itself. All of a sudden, that magic button in your throat that tells you 'Oh shit, this is really hot you guys' at 42 degrees celsius fires off at about <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11992116" target="_blank">34 degrees centigrade instead</a>. Considering the human body is about 37 degrees celsius at rest? That means you're firing on all cylinders. (This is also the reason that alcohol stings like a bastard when you get it on a cut; it's lowering the threshold for those same receptors, giving you that burning sensation in your fresh new wound.)</p>
<p>So obviously, the more alcohol -- ethanol -- you have in a drink, the more of these receptors it's going to trigger, and the more of a burning sensation you're going to feel; that's why Everclear hits harder than tequila, which hits harder than wine, which hits harder than beer, which hits harder than a clara. (Sidenote: claras are delicious and refreshing; half beer, half lemon Fanta. Try them this summer. You'll thank me.) So why do you get the burn differently even if the alcohol level seems to be the same? Surely it should be a direct relationship?</p>
<p>That's where the complexity hits.</p>
<p>The number on your bottle of hooch is the amount of ethanol in it, so in theory one bottle of 40% spirits should hit the same as another bottle of 40% spirits -- at least if ethanol content is the only factor. At least part of it is psychological in nature; you'd be astonished how much the science of taste comes down to external influences. Take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_Goose_(vodka\)" target="_blank">Grey Goose vodka</a>, for example, which has long been held up as a premium product, far superior to other vodkas, which is why they justify the price increase... <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/03/01/590022606/is-there-really-a-difference-between-expensive-vodka-and-cheap-vodka?t=1588566344686" target="_blank">except that people can't tell the difference between it and others</a>. People <em>expect</em> it to burn less, and so they <em>report</em> that it burns less. Anecdotal evidence is a powerful thing.</p>
<p>However, there are other things to consider too. Given that this is a temperature reaction, booze served cold -- that is, below the threshold of your TRVP1 receptors -- is going to feel less burny than booze that isn't, largely because it's not going to have a chance to warm up enough to trigger the burny sensation before it makes its way down to your stomach.</p>
<p>Beyond that? As far as I can tell, you're <em>mostly</em> dealing with speculation; I can't find a lot of studies that discuss specifically how much certain boozes 'burn'. (When you think about it, it would be difficult to do; the 'burn', as we just found out, is the kind of thing that's notoriously difficult to measure.) You'll find a lot of places on the internet talking about the 'heads' and the 'tails' of a drink -- that is, the first part and the last part that are removed, which tend to have more unseemly chemicals in that may affect the taste and are more commonly found in cheaper alcohols -- but evidence for that is pretty inconclusive. (They deal with the <em>taste</em>, but not necessarily the <em>burn</em>.) There's also a longrunning question, especially in home distilling, about whether <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxdFziQELA" target="_blank">adding glycerine to alcohol</a> will smooth it out -- but again, it's a bit hit and miss in terms of how much effect it has. Similarly, you'll find a lot of people saying that sweet alcohols burn less, but I can't find any evidence to suggest that that's the case beyond the merely anecdotal.</p>
<p><strong>In short:</strong> there are some things that definitely make a difference (temperature and alcohol content), and some things that <em>may</em> make a difference (additional chemicals and sweetness), but it seems that a lot of it is down to psychology and taste preferences. If you like the taste of the booze at the front of your mouth, you're less likely to notice the burn at the back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body has structures in your mouth and throat (known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPV1" target="_blank">VR1 receptors</a>) to tell how hot or cold your food is.  Pure alcohol reacts with these and makes them more easily stimulated.  Suddenly, your normal body temperature is enough to trigger them and create the feeling of heat.  The same is true of spicy foods.</p>
<p>As to why higher quality alcohol doesn't burn as badly, it is often because the alcohol has been aged in wooden barrels.  During this aging the alcohol will pull parts of the wood out, and combine with them.  This changes the flavour and makes it less likely to react to these receptors.</p>
<p>Cheap alcohol makers often use flavours such as cinnamon or vanilla; this has a similar effect to aging because it also reacts with the receptors and you get a pleasant taste instead of the harsh burn.  Chilling alcohol also helps, as it lowers your body temperature enough to not trigger the receptors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>None of you rubes ever tried moonshine, obviously.  It's the fusel oil, AKA non-ethanol alcohols and similar chemicals, that makes the burn.  Moonshine notoriously has a lot due to ad hoc and sloppy distillation processes.  Talk about sensory receptors and whatnot is not ELI5.  More like, mouth go burn when nasty chemicals go in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Higher priced alcohol throws out the first and last parts of the distillate, the head and the tail respectively, the head has more methanol in it and the tail has more of the flavor compounds as well as other, non-ethanol contaminants. I believe this is why shwill nasty heaven hill vodka tastes like skank piss, and something midgrade like skyy tastes pretty decent. Basically, good alcohol throws out the nasty parts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a well-known Liquor company as a client (I'm a Graphic Designer) and early this year I participated in a tasting at their office. it was one of their flagship brands, and there were six tastes of a bourbon that was brought out of the aging process early. The ones that had less aging burned more, and all the marketing people I tasted with attributed it to the lack of aging. Admittedly, that's anecdotal, but it's definitely the belief of people in the industry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
