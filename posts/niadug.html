		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physicist/Hearing Scientist here.  I think the question you're asking is how come sounds can be added together in the air, but then they can be broken apart by our brains.  Yes?</p>
<p>So, when two sounds meet, they interfere with each other.  They can add together if their peaks align, or they can subtract if the peak of one meets the trough of another.  But most of the time, they combine to form some complicated squiggle.  The thing is, this squiggle can alway be broken down in to a bunch of simple sine waves.  Mathematically, this is achieved through a process called Fourier Analysis.  Basically any squiggle (or at last any squiggle that the air can carry) can be split in to a number of pure sine waves (which is the kind of stereotypical wave shape).</p>
<p>Our ears are really good at this breakdown too.  Inside out ears, past the eardrum and some bones, is an organ called the <em>cochlea</em>.  It's a small shell-shaped thing, and contains a stretched strip called the basilar membrane.  When sounds hit this membrane, it wobbles up and down as the sounds travel along it.  But, because reasons (the shape of the membrane and physics of impedance etc., doesn't matter), different sounds can travel different distances along it.  Specifically, high pitched sounds can only travel a short distance, but low (bass) sounds can travel further.  When these waves stop, they cause a signal to get sent to the brain thanks to a bunch of 'hair cells' (they're not really hairs but they look like them up close) in something called the <em>Organ or Corti</em>.  Point is, the mix of sounds that enters your ear gets broken up by physics into all the different pitches of simple sounds.</p>
<p>From that point on, it's a case of your brain being a ridiculously good computer, and managing to piece back together which pitches came from certain sources so we can work out what all the different things we are hearing are and where.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because our brains have been using sound for a long time. By using the delay time between a sound reaching our ears in conjunction with the shape of our ears we can establish a direction and distance from the source without ever having to consciously decide to do so. We can do this for a huge number of simultaneous sounds because we can tell where each sound started. </p>
<p>As a neat aside, we can also hear the difference between hot and cold running water, and how full a vessel is. Loops back to the same point however, we've evolved a very strong skillset revolving around our ears because we've had them much longer than we've been human.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Waves are super interesting! So most people seem to think your question is this: &quot;How do our ears understand specific sounds when there are multiple sources of noise?&quot; </p>
<p>But I'm pretty sure what you are asking is: &quot;If sound is vibrating air molecules bumping into each other, why don't different sounds 'bump' into each other and become distorted and messed up immediately, or very quickly?&quot;</p>
<p>So I'm not yet an expert on waves, but I have studied them a little bit and plan on doing more in the future, but waves are weird. So a wave carries a certain amount of energy with it. An electronic speaker has a sort of cone-shaped membrane and electrical signals (often coils and magnets) make the membrane vibrate with enough force to &quot;push-pull&quot; the air in front of it. If you tried doing that slowly it's not going to make a sound, because there wasn't enough energy for it to make a wave. But I think this energy threshold for starting a wave is important.</p>
<p>So once a wave begins (we say it &quot;propagates&quot; when it &quot;moves&quot;) it carries some kind of information. In the case of sound waves, it carries some energy (simply put: the &quot;loudness&quot;) and the different frequencies. Different voices, different instruments, and everything else have many tiny differences in those frequencies due to shapes of bodies and materials and all kinds of other things. If you played different sounds from two speakers that were aimed diagonally towards each other (so their aim should cross), their sounds <em>will</em> interfere with each other. But because of the amount of energy contained in the initial sound signal - which decays over time - and perhaps other interesting properties of waves (which I'll try to get into below) they don't break down quickly and they don't interfere as much as solid objects interfere with each other.</p>
<p>Think of two billiard (&quot;pool&quot;) balls on a table and roll them across the table from one end to the other longways so that they barely touch in the middle. They'll both roll along the table longways the entire time, but when they bump they slightly change direction. They have a <em>momentum</em> and if their original direction was left-to-right, their bounce doesn't stop moving left-to-right, but it does change their motion slightly. </p>
<p>But waves are even more interesting! Because sound waves aren't made of one solid object moving across space (like the billiard balls) they are actually the transfer of vibrations across air molecules, they can pass against and through each other even more easily than the billiard balls. It's really a <em>transfer of energy</em> and not specific air molecules moving from point A to point B. Water waves are not very different at all. If you've ever swam in the ocean, you may have noticed that waves don't really &quot;push&quot; you, they just &quot;bob&quot; you up and down. That's because the water isn't really moving much in the direction that we see the wave move. The wave is the collective transfer of that energy from one place to another, but it isn't water all moving towards the beach.</p>
<p>So waves <em>do</em> interact with each other, and decay over time, and can cause interference! But not as easily as solid objects do! </p>
<p>This may have been a little bit higher than ELI5 but waves are hard! Hope this helps a bit!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a really big wave. If you throw something in it - it will still produce smaller waves - in this big wave. Then when waves are overlapping each other they create different interferences. When 2 “highs” meet - they create a bigger “high” - and vice versa. As long there are enough differences between them and/or differences/similarities are working together/against each other creating patterns - we can decode things. Our brains are crazy good at this because our lives depended on it throughout evolution. Additionally- that’s why we are best at decoding sound in the range of roughly around 1kHz to 5kHz - it’s where our own speech is located.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
