		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So apparently people can get diseases and not no it because they don't show symptoms. But it's to my understanding that symptoms are a sign that your body is fighting an infection. But at the same time symptoms are also what can kill a person with a disease. So if someone has an asymptomatic disease, then what exactly does it say about there immune system. Also (assuming they aren't contagious) is it a good or bad thing?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Immune systems have lots of tools they can use depending on the level of threat. But the immune system is also determining the level of threat, and sometimes that goes haywire. </p>
<p>Things like allergies or autoimmune diseases happen when the immune system determines that something is a larger threat than it actually is. The response is strong and can harm the person. </p>
<p>With asymptomatic carriers of a disease, the immune system has determined that the threat level of the disease is low, and the response is therefore also low. </p>
<p>There are different types of carriers: incubatory carrier, who has no symptoms yet, but will; shedding carrier, who had symptoms but does no longer; or fully asymptomatic carriers who never show symptoms but are still contagious. </p>
<p>It’s thought that with true asymptomatic carriers, the disease has hijacked part of the immune system, but it’s not fully understood yet.</p>
<p>ETA: Thanks for all the great discussion guys. I’m a teacher with calls to make to kids, and a mom with an attention hungry toddler so I won’t be replying anymore until at least after the kiddo’s bedtime. Stay safe and be well, everyone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, it's neither a sign of healthy or unhealthy immune system- it's a facet of infection that has had relatively little research!</p>
<p>Ok before I talk about asymptomatic-ness I'll briefly give a run down of a usual infection. You'll need to be around someone or around surfaces that are currently infected by a pathogen, say influenza/flu for example. Through some method of delivery, maybe you breathed it in, got in on your hand and rubbed your eye, etc etc- you are now for all intents and purposes infected.</p>
<p>Over the next 1-4 days (incubation period of influenza. Coronavirus is up to ~12 days) the virus is replicating inside you, reaching critical levels. Incubation period is considered over when you begin expressing symptoms.   Symptoms (we generally believe now) are due to your immune system detecting it and releasing nasty chemicals designed to screw up the virus- at a slight detriment to your cells (for example, a sore throat is due to these chemicals destroying lots of your throat cells, but hopefully killing far more viruses!)</p>
<p>Now we enter into the more unknown. Asymptomatic carriers, due to their nature as being asymptomatic, have been a very difficult group to try and pin down in epidemiology and disease. Some estimates would say anywhere between 5-35% of flu cases are asymptomatic. The very nature of them has made them difficult to find, investigate and draw conclusions from.</p>
<p>So yeah, sorry to end the question like that- the fact is it doesn't necessarily say anything about their immune system, our understanding of asymptomatic infection just isn't that great.</p>
<p>But! You did ask whether or not it's a good thing. It is very much a bad thing from an epidemiological stand point and the fact it exists is crucial in public health and communication of this (in light of the current coronavirus stuff...) to everyday people! Asymptomatic people, as far as current data is suggesting, are still contagious and can transmit the disease to others. Their place as 'super spreaders' as these people continue work means they can severely undermine containment of disease.</p>
<p>This is why it is very important that we should minimise close contact and sharing of surfaces at present. I hope this at least partially answers your question!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Immune system may not be the factor here.</p>
<p>Rather, the virus just can't do much to a particular physiology.</p>
<p>Our physiology varies in many subtle ways and not many are understood.  </p>
<p>It's like seeds that require acidic soil falling on alkaline soil.  They might germinate for awhile but soon die off without ever proliferating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It can be either.</p>
<p>The immune system can be thought of as having two parts, a regulatory component and an active component.  Think of it as having K-9 cops and attack dogs.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the regulatory component doesn’t work well.  The cops are asleep.  The dogs are free to roam wild.  Autoimmune diseases work this way.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the cops are whipped into a frenzy and the dogs go crazy.  This may be an overactive immune system, the way that Covid kills.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the cops are tied and the dogs are tired. This is a weakened system, such as with HIV, and infections run rampant, and the cause of death in many cases of AIDS.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This thread has me wondering. I know the asymptomatic carriers are really dangerous from an epidemiological perspective. They spread it to so many people, and that eventually gets around to those who are vulnerable and die from it.</p>
<p>But what about those carriers themselves? Are they at more of a personal risk from having no symptoms? I know some of the symptoms end up being what is deadly, and carriers are not going to have to eeal with that.</p>
<p>But does the virus just go unchecked and replicating until your body shuts down because they viral cells outcompete your own?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
