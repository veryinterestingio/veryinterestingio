If the hot water is too hot, than the temperature of the warm water is more sensitive to slight changes in the mixture. If you decrease the temperature of your hot water, you will have better control over the warm water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had an old shower that did this. The hot and cold mixed in the shower head itself, and part of the problem was that there was dirt in the showerhead. Cleaned it out, and the water mixed more gradually after that. This sometimes happens when older pipes get worked on and dirt or calcium dislodges from the inside of the pipes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of variables at play. The way most showers work is by mixing hot and cold. The water on your &quot;hot&quot; side is likely very hot so a small increase in that water probably shoots up the average temperature of the mix by a lot.</p>
<p>I'm also willing to bet that unless your shower is brand new, the handle is not easy to move by a TINY bit. Anytime you move it, it jumps so it's hard to control. Theoretically the water temperature on the hot side shouldn't matter if you have fine enough control. But it probably moves too much so a lot more hot water comes out.</p>
<p>Decreasing your water heater temperature might make this more gradual. Keep in mind, this will also make it so you have less shower time before the hot water is out. (It will take more &quot;less hot&quot; water to do the same amount of work as less &quot;very hot&quot; water).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thermostatic temperature control,  or balancing spool, or both. It's a safety feature that, say someone flushes a toilet, a piston heats up and slides allowing more cold water in to compensate rather than scald. When they get old their mechanism is loose and slides too easily or too quickly. This is often caused by water heaters set too high. 120 minimum (to prevent bacterial growth), 140 maximum to prevent scalding and wearing of plumbing components. </p>
<p>They're fairly easy to replace, water has to be shut off from the fixture (typically to the whole house), YouTube will show you how to get it apart rarely needing anything more than a screwdriver and pliars, and Home Depot or similar sell the replacement cartridge for about $30. </p>
<p>Consult r/plumbing if you need more help.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
