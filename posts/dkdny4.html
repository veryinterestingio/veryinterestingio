		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been re-watching the TV show Lost, and if you're not familiar with it, one character donates a kidney to another. Later in the show, the recipient of the kidney dies, and the SO of the donor jokes, &quot;Maybe he left you a kidney.&quot;</p>
<p>Could the donated kidney theoretically be returned to the donor's body? If so, what might be the medical implications? Would it transfer the recipient's illness to the donor? Would immunosuppressants need to be given to the donor?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any answers or suggestions where to learn more!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It could, but we never do it. This scenario happens all the time. Recipients are generally sicker people than donors, and as a result, many do not out live their donors. There are other technical factors with the organ as well, such as length of renal artery/vein/ureter that come into play. Returning the kidney to the original donor is unnecessary surgery without any real benefit. HLA does not change. Genetic makeup of the kidney does not change. </p>
<p>Source: I’m a surgeon </p>
<p>Funny story from surgical residency: performed a transplant where a male patient received a female’s kidney. While rounding on the patient the next day, he asked, “since I now have a female kidney, does this mean I have to sit down to pee?”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unless the donor is now in kidney failure they are better off without the kidney. There would be a risk of complication to put it back in when the person doesn’t even need the kidney.  </p>
<p>The kidney itself can often be subtly damaged the anti rejection drugs that the recipient took - making it already less than ideal for retranplant.  </p>
<p>The donor kidney might undergo changes in the recipient that would make it no longer a perfect match to the donor. I’m not an expert but look into HLA matching. if the recipient gets blood transfusions or the transplant of another organ it could change the HLA profile of the donated kidney so that it no longer perfectly matches the donor. (I think this is the case)</p>
<p>the kidney could transmit disease so would have to be screened.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are lots of reasons not to, but the foremost is technical. It is 10 times easier to operate on virgin tissue and there is 10 time the risk of any given complication doing revision surgery. We as surgeons take complications and mortality very seriously and revision operations should only be done by exceptionally talented surgeons with extensive experience and only when the implications of not doing the surgery are particularly grave for the patient. There are types of suffering that are fates worse than death, and some of those can be induced by major complications of surgery. It would be unacceptable for everyone involved for those to happen when a procedure was not even necessary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of practical and logistic reasons not to do it, and the organ may not be in great shape after all its been through (handling, anti-inflammatory medication, stress)... But as far as the question of &quot;would it still be a match?&quot; Yes. The organ will still be composed of the same cells, same DNA and same HLA profile as the original donor. Returning it back to the donor would immunologically be an &quot;autologous transplant&quot;. </p>
<p>Autologous transplants (of viable tissues) are generally highly successful (may include stem cells, bone marrow, blood, fat, tendon). <a href="https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/diagnosis-treatment/cancer-treatments/blood-stem-cell-transplantation/autologous" target="_blank">https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/diagnosis-treatment/cancer-treatments/blood-stem-cell-transplantation/autologous</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
