		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many reasons :</p>
<ol>
<li>You're not actually going to use that much space. Google can advertise &quot;Unlimited space&quot;, most people will only use a fraction of it.</li>
<li>If your read carefully the Terms of Service, it's not really &quot;Unlimited&quot;. There are conditions. But it will <em>feel</em> unlimited, cause the limit is way beyond what the average user does need.</li>
<li>You're the product. You get free storage, they get free data about you, that they'll turn into personalized advertising.</li>
</ol>
<p>It wouldn't be free and unlimited if Google had no way to make big bucks out of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because your data and you yourself are the product.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Google uses your photos to train their KI and what not of other products are in their X-Labs.</p>
<p>They are building the largest photo database ever and can use it for whatever they like.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they can combine the images with data taken at time of capture to build up their visual recognition machine learning capabilities, which will be the future of advertising (think of the power of providing contextual ads based on what you see). It also draws your deeper into their ecosystem.</p>
<p>The thing about Google is...</p>
<p>Everything Google does is to empower its primary business, which is advertising. Android, the Pixelbook line, the photo apps are all cost-centers (meaning they are business units not concerned with turning profit) and their main focus is just creating a more robust ecosystem to draw people to gather their data (to 1) further empower ad display algorithms and 2) to ensure better targeted ads) and show them ads that they will click on. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answers are true, but there's more to it. Unless you select a paid plan, they compress your photos by deleting a whole bunch of detail in your photos that most people wouldn't notice. This means that each photo doesn't take up as much space as it usually does.</p>
<p>As far as I'm aware, if you but the phone that Google makes (Pixel), you'll also get free unlimited uncompressed storage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
