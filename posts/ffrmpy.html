		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oil prices rise when economic output is strong. When business aren’t producing as much across the whole world then they don’t need to buy as much oil. That means that the oil that has already been produced doesn’t sell so the price lowers. So a low price for oil is sometimes related to a low demand for oil which is due to shrinking economic activity. It’s a little more complicated because oil isn’t freely traded. A large number of oil producing countries have banded together into a group called OPEC+ which can artificially set oil prices. Russia has recently had a disagreement with the group and has left the group. That made Saudi Arabia, one of the largest oil producers, increase production to extremely high rates in an attempt to flood the market with oil so the price will drop. This is designed to hurt Russia because the Russian economy is essentially little more than production of oil and other raw materials. This is extreme action that is a sign of high tension and instability. Stock markets tend to sell in times of uncertainty or when tensions may risk conflict. In the current situation there are worries that reduced travel and increased numbers of people sick from the COVID19 virus will reduce economic output/demand for oil. So the surplus of cheap oil on the market isn’t as likely to have a stimulatory effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Demand goes up when the economy is strong, price goes down when the economy is weak, and right now it's on life support. The price of oil is the indicator, not the driver, of economic health. That said, when it gets too high, it can act as an anchor on the global economy dragging it down.</p>
<p>Price is the thermometer, not the sickness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have out the cart before the whores.</p>
<p>Oil prices tanking does not cause the economy to tank. It is the opposite, when the economy is tanking, it causes oil prices to drop due to reduced demand for oil. Then people who have benefited from the lower oil prices can buy the typo in the first sentence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The price drop will hit American fracking companies and other oil producers very hard, leaving them unable to finance their debt. This will impact oil producing states, those who they owe money too, the workforce and the general economy. It's just another twist of the knife into the market already in near free fall due to covid-19. Trump's policy of giveaways to the market created a bubble and at the same time removed the ability to make meaningful intervention to stop the damage. Cheerful I know!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The economy is not tanking because oil prices are down. Oil prices are down due to slowdown in economic activity - people use less of it, so the price goes down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
