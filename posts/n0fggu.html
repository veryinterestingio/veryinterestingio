		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Overall, humans are remarkably similar at the genomic level - two unrelated people share about 99.9% of their DNA sequences. However, the small percentage that does differ can hold important genetic clues about our traits and health. Important discoveries in human genetics and genomics often rely on comparing groups of people, for example people with a given disease compared to people without the disease. These studies utilize genomic data from individuals who have contributed their DNA for research purposes, most of which (approximately 80%) are individuals of European ancestry, yet 16% of the global population is made up of people of European ancestry. The failure to include some populations in genetic studies means researchers are likely missing discoveries that can benefit everyone, and results can have limited utility across different populations.</p>
<p>We're here to discuss the <a href="https://www.ashg.org/dna-day/" target="_blank">2021 DNA Day Essay Contest question</a>, which asked high school students around the world to address how population representation impacts genomic findings and whether inclusion of more diverse populations in genetic and genomic studies holds a potential to benefit future genetic research and improve human health.</p>
<p>Some groups who are working to improve population representation in genetic and genomic research include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Human Heredity and Health in Africa Initiative (H3Africa), which is collecting genetic samples from participants in 27 African countries, as well as funding African investigators working in African institutions.<a href="https://h3africa.org/index.php/about/" target="_blank">https://h3africa.org/index.php/about/</a></li>
<li>The Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) Consortium, which will genotype approximately 50,000 individuals from non-European populations. <a href="https://www.pagestudy.org/" target="_blank">https://www.pagestudy.org/</a></li>
<li>The All of Us Research Program, which plans to recruit one million American individuals - at least half of whom are of non-European ancestry - to learn more about how differences in lifestyle, environment, and genetics influence health and disease. <a href="https://www.joinallofus.org/" target="_blank">https://www.joinallofus.org/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The American Society of Human Genetics is a partner in organizing today's AMA. For more information on human genetics and genomics, check out their Discover Genetics page: <a href="https://www.ashg.org/discover-genetics/" target="_blank">https://www.ashg.org/discover-genetics/</a>. And, for more information on this yearâ€™s Essay Contest question, check out this fact sheet: <a href="https://www.ashg.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/DG_FactSheet_PopRepresentation_v5.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.ashg.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/DG_FactSheet_PopRepresentation_v5.pdf</a></p>
<p>Our group today includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marina DiStefano, PhD (u/Marina_DiStefano) - I am an assistant professor and clinical molecular geneticist in the Geisinger Precision Health Program and an affiliate member at the Broad Institute. I lead the Broad-based ClinGen biocuration team and work with multiple Consortiums to develop and set standards for curation data available to the public.</li>
<li>Claudia Gonzaga-Jauregui, PhD (u/cgonzagaj) - I am a geneticist working on rare, undiagnosed, and Mendelian diseases. I identify the molecular causes of genetic disorders to provide diagnoses and novel genes association. I am particularly interested in studying genomic variation in diverse and underrepresented populations to improve community and population precision health and reduce disparities.</li>
<li>Tiffany Oliver, PhD (u/Tiffany_Oliver) - I am an associate professor in the Department of Biology at Spelman College where I run a laboratory, teach upper-level genetics courses, and serve my professional community through several collaborative studies with government agencies including NIH and NSF. I have gained ample experience in providing scientific and technical advice to members of the scientific community and the general public.</li>
<li>Jessica Zhou (u/Jessica_Zhou_ASHG) - I am a PhD candidate in the Bioinformatics and Systems Biology program at the University of California San Diego. My research focuses on studying the molecular basis of substance use disorders. As a computational biologist, I work with computers to extract novel biological insight from experimental data.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will be online throughout the day to answer your questions. Thanks for hosting us, reddit, and AUA!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, is much known about how the &quot;microbiome&quot; and various genetic populations? For example if x population eats a lot of a millet and thrives off feeding bacteria x, would a population elsewhere also thrive off that or could their DNA be geared more towards a grain that they historically have had more of a tendency to eat? </p>
<p>Also, are there any cool genetic adaptions that we know about, for example as I understand it Sherpa people are genetically better able to adapt to high elevations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
