		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Robots are expensive, so unless they are going to save a significant amount of money for the restaurant, it doesn't offer any advantage over just hiring a chef.</p>
<p>Also, some restaurants do use robots - there's a noodle cutting robot that some Chinese restaurants use. </p>
<p>Also if you have a flexible definition of &quot;Robot,&quot; things like sous vide circulators are technically robots, and restaurants definitely use those.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are I believe some fast food places that do automate their production lines, but they are few. .</p>
<p>As to why we have such a small adoption, the way I see it, there are three main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Robots are best suited for extremely standardized and repetitive tasks. While cooking might seemingly look that way (just apply the recipe right?), it isn't.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not all pieces of meat are the same, and require slightly different times to cook for example. Same for vegetables, which might need to be chopped differently to adjust for variations.</p>
<p>Now I'm not saying that it's <em>absolutely impossible</em> to create a robot that can do that, because we surely could, but that brings us to the second point.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Cost. The sheer complexity of a machine capable of performing all those tasks will make it big, and expensive to buy and maintain. This is sure to put off most restaurants.</p>
</li>
<li>Desirability. The sheer marketing power of &quot;your dish was prepared by our fancily decorated chef/homeowner who put their heart into it&quot; vs &quot;by our soulless robot&quot; is pretty sizeable IMO.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is okay in fast food joints. Much less in better/fancier places</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I worked at McDonald's, we used plenty of robots. Robots measured the fry oil contaminants and told us when to drain and clean it. Robots knew to cook different burgers at different compression levels and for different amounts of time. Robots made the milkshakes and frappes by mixing the right ingredients and blending them together. </p>
<p>What you are really asking here, is what is the difference between machines and robots? </p>
<p>All those robots at McDonald's might be better labeled as &quot;machines&quot; instead. Do they have a need for something that seems more like a robot?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are cooking robots in factories for prepackaged foods, where there's much higher volume, and less variation. It's a lot easier to build an automated line to make 100k of the same product a day than to make a few hundred each of 10 different products a day. </p>
<p>For example, the hamburger buns at your burger place were likely baked in an automated factory with a tunnel oven. I haven't been to any restaurants that have that much room for an oven, or that need that many hamburger buns in a day.  </p>
<p>Also, how would a cooking robot handle modified orders (extra cheese, no onion, etc.) or food allergies?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Precise robots require precise inputs. Those robots used in high speed/high precision factories have another automated machine who's entire job is to carefully present the required part in a known position so it can easily be picked up, and each part is effectively identical</p>
<p>Cooking is imprecise, baking is a lot more manageable (it's food chemistry) but cooking is hard</p>
<p>How do you make a fried egg? How long does it cook? Depends on the exact egg you get. If some eggs are 60 grams while others are 66 grams that changes the cooking time significantly. What do you do if you get a double yoke??</p>
<p>You can get around these issues with fancy($$$$) vision systems and image processing, but it's often cheaper just to keep the meatbag at the grill than to try to replace him with a robot</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
