I tried to ask my natural science teacher this question, but he could not answer it. Why is it that the half-time of for an example Radium-226 is 1600 years, while the half-time for Uranium-238 is 4.5 billion years? Do we actually know the factors that makes the half-time of a specific isotope? Or is this just a &quot;known unknown&quot; in natural science? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's different for each type of decay, but we have a good idea of how each type of decay works.</p>
<p>For decays where something is simply emitted without any new particles being created (alpha, nucleon emission, cluster emission, and spontaneous fission), the simple model is that the emitted particle is &quot;pre-formed&quot; inside the nucleus, and then tunnels out of the nuclear potential well. So you can use relatively simple quantum mechanics to <a href="https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/downloadFile/3779576931836/Ex8Serie1/" target="_blank">calculate the probability of the particle tunneling through the barrier</a>, given that it's already been pre-formed inside the nucleus. To determined the probability of pre-formation is another beast. For individual nucleons, it's easy, because nothing has to &quot;form&quot;. But for alphas, clusters, or fission fragments, it's not so straightforward. And for spontaneous fission and cluster emission, you have to consider deformation effects. You can come up with a potential energy surface as a function of the nuclear deformation (this is multi-dimensional, as it takes 5 parameters to completely specify the quadrupole tensor of the nucleus), and find a way to calculate the evolution of the system through that potential energy surface. The system evolves to find its minimum-energy configuration. If it's favorable for some deformed nucleus to split into two fragments, then fission/cluster emission will occur to minimize the energy.</p>
<p>For decays where particles are created, gamma and beta, we apply the theories of the electromagnetic and weak forces respectively. You just come up with some operator that represents the electromagnetic transition, use some approximation of the nuclear wavefunction, and calculate the decay rate from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi%27s_golden_rule" target="_blank">Fermi's golden rule</a>.</p>
<p>For gamma decay, the transition operators are electromagnetic multipole operators. Using the angular momenta and parities of the initial and final states, you can determine which multipoles contribute to the total decay probability, and calculate all of them (or at least the lowest-order one, which will tend to dominate over the others).</p>
<p>For beta decay, the operators are the &quot;Fermi&quot; and &quot;Gamow-Teller&quot; operators. The names just refer to whether the beta particle and neutrino spins are aligned or anti-aligned. Besides that, it's the same as gamma decay. You just determine what angular momenta and parities are allowed, figure out which ones are more important, and calculate those using Fermi's golden rule and some approximate nuclear wavefunctions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is how you can compare this between all different isotopes: <a href="https://www-nds.iaea.org/relnsd/vcharthtml/VChartHTML.html" target="_blank">The chart of nuclides</a>. The black diagonal line shows all stable isotopes, and the further away from this you get the more unstable an isotope is (smaller T½). An isotope's location in the chart relative to stable ones roughly determines the main decay mechanism (as is color coded) and you can change the color coding to show half-life.</p>
<p>You can see that uranium has no stable isotope, it's just that U-298 has the longest half-life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The half life of an isotope all depends on the stability of the nucleus. There is a great chart you can look up called the isotope stability curve which shows how isotopes tend to decay and the trend between proton number and neutron number. </p>
<p>The stability of the nucleus depends on a few things.
1 The strong nuclear force - protons and neutrons (nucleons) in the nucleus are attracted together by the strong nuclear force, the attraction gets smaller the further apart the nucleons are, however the attraction also gets smaller when nucleons get too close and even starts to strongly repel. This holds them apart and stable, as long as there aren’t too many nucleons packed together in one nucleus.
2 Electromagnetism - the protons are positivity charged and very close together in a nucleus, this means they repel each other very strongly, as nuclei get bigger and there are more protons the tension between the strong force and the electromagnetism gets more intense.
3 The weak force - basically it can change the types of quarks which make up the nucleons when the nucleus becomes unstable. So for example, Carbon 14 is an isotope of Carbon which has 2 more neutrons than the most common isotope carbon 14. One of the down quarks in a neutron will flip into an up quark, making the neutron into a proton and emitting an electron and other radiation as the nucleus reorganises itself to its lowest energy state.
4 Quantum mechanics - so I’m not entirely sure on this part because the science is pretty dense but I’m pretty sure the reason the half life is a half life instead of a linear decay is because the particles are heavily influenced by random fluctuations in energy caused by quantum uncertainty.
So essentially what’s happening is a balancing act between the strong nuclear force, electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force with quantum fluctuations randomly providing the the energy necessary for decay to occur. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the end of the day, all reactions: chemical reactions, physical reactions (state changes etc), nuclear reactions, everything occurs based on stability/thermodynamics. The equilibrium is based on the energy difference between the start and end, and the rate is determined by how high the activation energy is (the “hill” in the middle of <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Gibbs_free_energy.JPG" target="_blank">this</a> diagram). When you have more unstable reactants, the left side is higher, and generally closer to the top of the “hill” meaning the activation energy is lower. This speeds up the reaction rate. The reasons for the instability are discussed in some of the other comments here, but at an underlying level, all reactions come back to energy and thermodynamics. So quickly decaying elements are highly unstable, and therefore have a lower activation energy. If you plan on studying any chemistry in the future, or even if you’re just curious, I highly recommend studying the relationship between thermodynamics, kinetics, and equilibrium and knowing it very well. It comes up again and again and again. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
