		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, even airplanes can be affected.  Both the frequency (akin to red/blue shift) of the carrier and the duration of digital packets need to be taken into account.  </p>
<p>Depending on the nature of the communication, it can be done on either transmission or reception or both.</p>
<p>i.e. contacting iss on AM, the ground station needs to compensate for Doppler frequently.
<a href="https://www.qsl.net/ah6rh/am-radio/spacecomm/doppler-and-the-iss.html" target="_blank">https://www.qsl.net/ah6rh/am-radio/spacecomm/doppler-and-the-iss.html</a> and the ISS isn't in a position to adjust to just any ground station.</p>
<p>Likewise if your terrestrial station is on the earths axis, and the probe is moving at a relatively constant speed in an essentially straight line you could use a fixed compensation, or if the probe is moving away from the earth on the axis (though you may have to consider polarization).</p>
<p>At the other extreme, if your terrestrial stations are on the equator, and the probe is moving on the equatorial plane, the signal will have +- 1000 mph to contend with just from the rotation of the earth, and in the case of mars orbiters, you have gradual (timewise) but extreme changes due to the different orbits of earth and mars around the sun (looked it up, max relative speed is ~121017 mph).  At any tolerable bit rate, you are gonna feel 120000 mph worth of doppler.  Plus the orbit of the probe itself.</p>
<p>edit, got my spacecraft confused.</p>
<p>edit2, geostationary satellites get a pass on Doppler effect from the perspective of ground stations (once in orbit).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. NASA’s Deep Space Network uses extremely precise clocks to synthesize the carrier waves and test signals. Basically a probe can echo back the test signal and by comparing the echo to the known transmission they can get some information on the probes trajectory. The process is known as “ranging”.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am actually working on visualising this very thing right now for an assignment. <a href="https://nl.mathworks.com/content/mathworks/nl/en/company/newsletters/articles/teaching-hands-on-satellite-tracking-and-communication-to-delft-university-of-technology-undergraduates/_jcr_content/mainParsys/image_3.adapt.full.high.jpg/1537455956612.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a> you can see the radiocommunications of a normal satellite that is passing over a ground station. Time moves from top to bottom frequency from left to right. If the satellite is approaching the station the signal gets compressed and the frequency is higher. On this graph you can nicely see when the satellite is closest to the station so it can be used to determine the current orbit of the satellite. You can see the trails of 2 satellites in this picture but the antenna only points at one. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I do LEO satcom for a living! And yes it has to be accounted for one way or another.
Usually the transponders are wide enough to acquire the signal outside the center frequency by some percentage of the frequency.</p>
<p>The ground equipment is usually more tolerant and requires less to lock and uses a PLL to track the signal as it changes frequency due to doppler. We lock on the downlink first (unless there is a blind acquisition, but that is a different story). </p>
<p>When transmitting to a satellite we usually start by sending an unmodulated carrier and apply modulation as soon as we see the satellite has acquired the signal.
In some cases the spacecraft are not designed tolerant and we will apply a calculated frequency shift to compensate from the ground.</p>
<p>During the early critical phase after launch, some operators use the recorded doppler combined with a ranging signal to do orbit determination. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes the Doppler effect is accounted for with spacecraft and actually it is usually used as a way to measure gravitational effects of objects they are orbiting. If you look at the Juno spacecraft at Jupiter one of the experiments is to use the Doppler effect to map out the shape of Jupiter's core by detecting the slight changes in the spacecrafts orbit based on the shape of the core.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
