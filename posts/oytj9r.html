		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see a lot of answers that look like they aren't addressing what the OP asked.  The question wasn't &quot;why would a store want you to pick debit instead of credit?&quot;  The question was why you have to enter a PIN for debit and not for credit?  If the card lets you use either mode and either mode draws from the same account, what's the point?</p>
<p>I viewed it as a question about security, not about transactional fees.</p>
<p>As to my attempt at an answer: The main reason is that they're two different systems developed independently from each other each with their own different laws and banks started issuing cards that let you access either system, but the old laws for each system are still present and need to be followed.</p>
<p>But that doesn't answer the question of what reasons there might be for different rules for them? </p>
<p>Basically, originally credit cards were never intended to be immediate transactions.  Before everything got computerized it was a promise to pay, not an immediate payment.  The restaurant, or store, bills the credit card company saying &quot;This is the total money you owe us on behalf of your customers that used your cards in our store today.&quot;  The credit card company pays that bill, and then you owe the credit card company for it at the end of the month.  This causes a large time buffer.  Because the payment doesn't happen immediately there is time to dispute the bill.  There is time to argue that fraud occurred.  The hope is that if someone uses the card illegally, there's time to find out before it wipes your bank account out.  The credit card company didn't suck the money right from you bank account - they waited for you to reimburse them.</p>
<p>Compare that with a debit card, which *did* directly suck money out of your bank account immediately.  No time to dispute the charge, it already happened.  That made it require more security.  There's no delay between a stolen card being used and you losing the money.</p>
<p>Even today, when both systems can be attached to the same account, so in credit mode it still sucks money out of your account just like in debit, there's still more legal channels available for fraud resolution in the credit system than the debit system.  Also, the debit system gives access to your money in untraceable cash form (withdraw from ATM then the cash becomes anonymous after that), while credit transactions all get a paper trail that can be traced.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At least where I live, we need to insert the PIN regardless if you are using credit or debit.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One distinction for me:  There is a particular gas station/convenience store chain in my area.  While buying gas at the pump, when you run the card as &quot;debit&quot; with your PIN, the exact amount of the sale gets deducted from your account immediately. If you buy - say- $28.99 in gas, then that amount is debited immediately.  However, if you choose &quot;credit&quot;, they put a hold of $125 - regardless of how much gas you actually purchase...potentially tying up funds that you need.  You EVENTUALLY get the difference refunded; but it can take over 7 days to do so. So in this instance, there is an advantage for selecting &quot;debit&quot; over &quot;credit&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
