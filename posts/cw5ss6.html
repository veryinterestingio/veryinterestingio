Improper freezing can mean you need to get it to 'piping hot' throughout to kill any residual bacteria.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of that stuff that says that on the bag is not cooked, you'll notice it says &quot;fully cooked&quot; if it's actually cooked. Things like chicken nuggets are very often not fully cooked, they are breaded and deep fried just long enough to brown up and make the bread stick, the centers are not cooked, this is very common with fried foods as frying twice tends to make it extra crispy anyways.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Food Scientist Here:</p>
<p>You reheat for a few reasons:</p>
<p>1.) Obviously, flavor/sensory/experience. Most people don't like the texture or sensory aspects of a frozen chicken. So they cook it.  Cooking can also give you a &quot;browning&quot; effect. This is when sugars or other components get heated up and add flavor. Think of a sausage on a grill.</p>
<p>2.) Safety: while not all bacteria grow in frozen conditions, some do. Listeria is an example. It grows slowly, but sometimes people keep things in their freezer for long periods of time. Listeria, or other pathogens/spoilage organisms, can come into contact with the food after its cooked and before or after freeze. Cooking ensures it kills them off</p>
<p>3.) Some foods are just meant to be eaten hot!</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
