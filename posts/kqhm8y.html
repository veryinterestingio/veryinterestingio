If you decided to nap during the day without being tired then you'll likely have just as much trouble falling asleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think at night there is very little ambient noise so you &quot;hear&quot; every little bump in the night and your brain reacts to that as suspicious and wakes you. during the day there is a lot of noise and your brain filters it out as &quot;just more noise&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My completely uneducated take, is that if I'm napping during the day, it's because my eyes are literally closing by themselves. Rare, but it happens. If I try to go to sleep at a &quot;reasonable&quot; time I might have trouble for an hour or two, cause it's a bit early for me, and that's how long it takes to get to that eyes-closing-by-themselves level of tired.</p>
<p>More scientifically (SOMEONE PLEASE CORRECT ME) I've heard that once you wake up, the waves of &quot;potential REM sleep&quot; are closest together, and get farther apart as the day goes on, after waking. So those waves of peak energy, then a lull, then peak energy, then a lull etc. etc. are farthest apart when it's actually the ideal time to fall asleep. (Which I believe is why it's hardest to wake up, because that &quot;last 5 minutes&quot; actually has a better chance of completing a full REM cycle, when you've already been asleep for 4.5-6 hours.) which is also why people have the urge to nap most pretty close to the time they wake up (1-2hours after waking) and hit a stride of not feeling tired enough for a nap anymore after being awake for 4+ hours. Your body has already accepted its not getting another REM cycle in.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm an idiot, Monophasic sleep is fucking weird, thanks for reading.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
