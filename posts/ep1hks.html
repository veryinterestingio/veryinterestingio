		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Inflation means that a dollar gets less valuable over time (by 2% a year). Too much inflation, and money becomes worthless, like in Weimar Germany. The too-little problem is a bit trickier. </p>
<p>Inflation encourages people and corporations (and especially banks) to do things with their money, specifically, invest it in businesses, education, or something else. If money loses 2% of its value each year, companies have to be doing something with it that earns at least a 2% profit - like lending it out.</p>
<p>Basically, inflation forces banks and billionaires to stop just sitting on money and instead reinvest it, creating new businesses and jobs and driving the economy forwards.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Inflation isn't necessarily good, but deflation is extremely bad.  As others have stated, inflation causes currency to lose value over time.  The quicker the currency is losing the value, the quicker people want to get out and spend it.  So inflation encourages participation in the economy and the churn of money that keeps everything moving.  Deflation causes currency to gain in value, which sounds great, but it encourages people to save all their money instead of spending it.  As people disengage from the economy, things start to slow down.  Manufacturers start seeing that people aren't buying their goods as much, so they start making fewer goods.  Now that they don't need as many goods produced, they start laying off workers.  As people see their neighbors losing their jobs, they get nervous and start spending even less to hedge the risk of future unemployment.  And the cycle keeps repeating in a self-reinforcing manner.  </p>
<p>High inflation can have terrible effects too, as seen in Weimar Germany, Zimbabwe, or Venezuela, but it's generally much easier to slow down people's rate of purchasing things than it is to convince people to start spending again once they've stopped.  So overall it's much better to accept having a little inflation than to risk having any deflation.  2% inflation is the commonly accepted safe buffer to shoot for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>VeniVediVelcro hit the nail on the head but just imagine the opposite scenario. </p>
<p>Let's say there is a 2% deflation rate. Money is getting more and more valuable every year! That's great! Except now banks and corporations and anyone with a good chunk of change has incentive to do absolutely nothing with the money. They can just sit on it and they will make money actually.</p>
<p>Economies are like water. You want lots of fluidity and swishy swashy moving around. Not a stagnate still pool</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>TL;DR</em>
<em>Inflation is bad for people who cannot fight for better wages. If you are paid $500/week and the cost of everything increases by 5%, unless you can fight for more pay, you lose.</em></p>
<p><em>Inflation is good for people who are in debt (as my debt is worth less than it was before) and small businesses (I can get away with charging more and not increase my staff's wages)</em></p>
<p>I think the best way to answer this is to explain the impacts of inflation.</p>
<p>Inflation is good for some and bad for others. </p>
<p>Generally, high inflation is good for those on strong wages and bad for those on weak wages.</p>
<p>High inflation is good for those in debt, but bad for lenders (unless the interest rate climbs) or people with savings earning interest.</p>
<p>And vice versa.</p>
<p>Example 1.
I lend you $500 for 1 year and get 5% interest.
If the inflation rate was high (5%), when you pay me back I have effectively made no profit.</p>
<p>I made $50 in interest, but it is still only worth what $500 was a year ago.</p>
<p>This is great for the borrower who found it easy to pay me back though as their wage increased.</p>
<p>Example 2:
An elderly couple retires with a fixed income of $500 per week.
rent = $300
Food = $150
Save = $50</p>
<p>But costs inflate 10% over 2 years.</p>
<p>Now,
They still make $500 per week
Rent = $330
Food = $165
Save = $5</p>
<p>So now, the couple does not have the money to cover incidentals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
