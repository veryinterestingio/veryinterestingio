Sort of like using a phone book to find an electrical company instead of driving around yourself until you find one.</p>
<p>Local searches on your computer take a little longer since a lot of times the hard drive is doing other stuff while you're looking for that data. You're making it multi-task.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Google spends a lot of time building a searchable index of what they can return in their search engine. They've done a lot of work ahead of time to catalog everything in a way that makes it faster.</p>
<p>However, keeping an index like this costs a lot of space, so your computer doesn't maintain an index as in depth as the one Google has.</p>
<p>It's like going into a library and looking for a book by just going down all the shelves, versus going into the library and looking up a book in their index cards and then going to the right shelf (I might be dating myself a bit here...).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Google's index isn't the entire internet, it's a carefully curated and optimized directory of search terms and websites, which is massively replicated across a huge number of servers, permitting each request to be handled as quickly as possible. The process of updating, disseminating, and pruning that index is constant, massive, and ongoing, using automated processes to crawl the entire web building the index.</p>
<p>When you search your hard drive for a file in explorer, you're using a serial, recursive process to traverse your entire file tree looking for a match for whatever search parameters you made. This kind of linear search is much more time intensive, as the data is, from the perspective of the algorithm, completely unstructured.</p>
<p>Let me use an analogy which I think will explain the difference. In your basement you have 100 bankers boxes full of folders with documents in them. The boxes are unlabled, and the contents of the folders are more or less randomized. To find a particular document in that system could take hours, days, or weeks. But if you were to take those boxes, sort through each of them, alphabetize them, label each box, and arrange the boxes so that you could quickly find the box, read the label, find and retrieve the document you wanted, the process could be reduced to minutes. Transfer the documents from bankers' boxes to filing cabinets, it could be seconds.</p>
<p>PS: Google used to have a program called &quot;Google Desktop&quot; which would use the same type of algorithm Google uses to sift through the internet to sift through your computer, email, etc., and search it more quickly. However, Google discontinued the product back in 2011, on the undertaking that more and more user-data was already in the cloud, so the relative value of the platform to Google and their users was negligible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
