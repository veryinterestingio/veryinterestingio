		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are more often no re-used. The fact that they have been exposed to something could bias the results of a future experiment. Specially with new toxins/medications whose effects are not fully understood. All of the EU and both Canada and US have some form of animal care guidelines that have to be followed for experiments to be allowed to occur. Over the years, I wrote many of the so-called Animal Use protocols. One of the sections that is required is what will be done with remaining animals. Usually, they are euthanized and the guidelines have methods that are humanely accepted for each species. Sometimes they may be kept for other purposes, but if do so, you have to let the Animal Care Committee know where they are going to be kept, how they are going to be fed, so on on.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually autopsies are performed to learn more about the effects of the drug at high doses. Just because it survived, they would still want to know if it had cirrhosis or lesions on the brain, or something else that would eventually lead to death. They would not keep them alive long term unless that was prescribed as part of the study.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This may be of interest to you, though it isn’t as scientific as some of the answers here. </p>
<p>I have a family friend who raises and trains raptors and birds of prey, and one major source of rodents for his animals is the “control” animals from various tests at the local pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p>Every experiment needs a control animal; a normal, unaffected animal to compare the others to. They aren’t reused from one test to the next, so after they’re humanely euthanized they’re given to him to use for his birds.</p>
<p>I always thought it was very cool that there was a way to give those animals an additional purpose, with the added bonus being that his work is education-based. The sacrifice of an animal test subject assists scientific research and then goes on to have a ripple effect in our community.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've worked at a contract medical device testing facility that did animal testing (rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs, pigs, and monkeys). All animals were terminated at the end of the experiment. Most studies were to implant a device and check for adverse reaction, but no sponsor wanted to get potential residual effects from whatever the animal had in it before. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
