		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Traditionally, Marines were fighting soldiers assigned to ships. Their job was to protect the ship's officers from a mutiny, as well as aid in naval combat (e.g. boarding and repelling boarding).</p>
<p>Later Marines became amphibious assault troops. If attacking by sea, the USA would tend to use Marines. This was the case in the Pacific during WWII. Marines were the first ones to hit the beaches, and then the Army would take over once there was a secure landing zone.</p>
<p>In the USA nowadays, the Marines are organized as a rapid response force. I don't know the specifics, but the Marines might have a mandate to be able to assault any part of the world within 48 hours, and have enough troops and supplies to hold it for 72 hours, something like that. This give the Army enough time to mobilize and establish a more secure force in the area. This is why the Marines have their own ground forces, ground vehicles, ships, and aircraft. Recently, there is talk about downsizing the Marines because they are somewhat redundant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know those pirate movies, or war movies set in the Age of Sail, where a group of people from one ship forcibly boards the enemy/pirate ship and starts fighting them hand-to-hand? That's basically what the &quot;Marines&quot; were set up as.</p>
<p>The Army couldn't do that job because they were land based. The Navy personnel couldn't do that job because they still needed to focus on sailing their own ship. So what was needed was a &quot;ship-borne infantry&quot;, who were designed to sail on the ships, and then jump off and attack the enemy ship/beach/land. (Or, on the other hand, to defend their own ships against incoming enemy attackers).</p>
<p>That's basically what the Marines are still designed to be: deployed on ships to a place of conflict, then attack/fight/raid on land or enemy ships. They are often used as a 'rapid' first-response type force, that can be sent quickly anywhere to initially engage the enemy, while the Army/Navy are still building up their forces.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Marine units started as infantry who served aboard ships to help them fight in boarding actions (ship to ship) and in a limited capacity for raids (ship brings marines to shore, they attack/disrupt enemy installations, then return to the ship, which sails away). In these roles, it makes sense that they are considered part of the Navy than the Army (which is currently kind of the case; the USMC is part of the Department of the Navy, alongside the US Navy proper).</p>
<p>Their role began expanding as the types of conflicts the US engaged in started expanding. The US, bordering two relatively friendly nations, doesn't need to use its army that much. To project power (ie, invade other nations, for good or ill), it must use its navy to transport its forces to the destination. It's a lot easier to conduct these operations under a single chain of command than to have Army and Navy personnel fighting over who gets to be top dog. So the Marines began to take on this role, since they have close associations with the navy anyway.</p>
<p>They are considered distinct from Army and Navy because they are frequently put in relatively unique positions. They must conduct amphibious attacks in close coordination with Navy ships, while maintaining enough land-mobile firepower to accomplish their objective, usually on their own. As such, they need to be as self-sufficient as possible; they have their own air force, tank units, infantry units, and landing craft. The best way for all of these disparate units to coordinate is for them to be part of a single organization. Additionally, the best way for that organization to excel at their unique purpose is for it to be independent of other departments which may have their own doctrines/best practices that may not be useful in Marine operations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The USMC is a specialized combined-arms force, with an aim for what is called Expeditionary Warfare, or combat operations well away from established bases or logistical support. In the modern era, this makes the Marines more of a rapid assault force, meant to push into dangerous territory and only hold that territory long enough for heavier but slower Army or Navy forces to fill the gap. Alternatively, if you want to rapidly deploy to a given area and then withdraw once whatever objective has been fulfilled, but you can't really do it in a clandestine manner, you use the Marines.</p>
<p>They're generally held separate from the other branches, but at the same time they interface with the Navy much more often than other branches (in major part because one of their major uses is amphibious landings), and as a result they're organized under the Department of the Navy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>best way to think of what the Marines are  is basically just seeing them as &quot;Naval infantry&quot; they were originally meant ot be the acting ground forces assigned to a ship mostly to keep mutiny in check and later on to be a boarding/repelling  force.</p>
<p>in current days they mostly just act as infantry that is under the employ of the Navy and do mostly the same jobs regular infantry does..</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
