		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Though they are much rarer than skeletal fossils, there are examples of fossilized skin imprints that indicate what extinct dinosaurs might have looked like.  For example, see this <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/photography/proof/2017/05/nodosaur-fossil-discovery-science-photography/" target="_blank">extremely well preserved <em>Borealopelta</em></a> specimen (though standalone fossils like <a href="https://i.imgur.com/AV6fkgM.jpg" target="_blank">this one from an <em>Edmontosaurus</em></a> are more common.  And we do in fact know that many dinosaurs <em>did</em> have feathers, from fossils which preserve them like <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Sinosauropteryxfossil.jpg" target="_blank">this <em>Sinosauropteryx</em></a>.</p>
<p>Though there are many species for which we don't have conclusive evidence of feathers yet, it's still possible to infer that they likely were feathered with techniques like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_bracketing" target="_blank">phylogenetic bracketing</a>.  Here's a <a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1op2-2uG7vY/WWR8qUY-TaI/AAAAAAAADQw/nRM76Bu_utwtU0EuWPDTAR6zhtLgvYACACLcBGAs/s1600/133.JPG" target="_blank">cartoon</a> (from <a href="http://albertonykus.blogspot.com/2011/06/maniraptor-feathers-part-ii.html" target="_blank">this blog</a>) that illustrates how this technique suggests that <em>Deinonychus</em> had feathers even though we don't have physical evidence for this.  Since vaguely feather-like structures have been found not only in theropods but in other groups of dinosaurs too (e.g., <a href="http://www.senckenberg.de/files/content/presse_joerdens/2016/psittacosaurus_modell_c_jakob_vinther_robert_nicholls.jpg" target="_blank"><em>Psittacosaurus</em>' tail bristles</a>), and even in non-dinosaurs like the <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2188405-stunning-fossils-show-pterosaurs-had-primitive-feathers-like-dinosaurs/" target="_blank">pycnofibres of some pterosaurs</a>, it's quite possible that a large percentage of dinosaurs had similar structures in some form.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quite a lot of dinosaurs <em>were</em> covered in feathers. Coelurosaurs (the group which includes, amongst other things, raptors, ornithimimids, tyrannosaurs, and birds) almost all had feathers. Modern birds, raptors, and the like had a full covering of feathers, while other dinosaurs sometimes had a covering of simpler protofeathers, which were more like fur. Some Coelurosaurs, such as <em>T.rex</em> itself, may not have possessed feathers.</p>
<p>As for other groups of dinosaurs, there is still some debate on this. Some allosaurids/carnosaurs may have had feathers- for instance, <em>Concavenator</em> fossils have been found with what may or may not be quill knobs. Others, such as <em>Carnotaurus,</em> were most likely covered in scales. Some basal ceratopsians has long quills on their tails, and it has been suggested the more derived forms had the same. It’s quite possible the last common ancestor of all dinosaurs had feathers, and many groups lost them over time.</p>
<p>Back on to the main question, dinosaur skin, feathers, and scales are sometimes preserved in addition to fossils. Some organisms are so well preserved, they have intact melanosomes, which allow us to tell what colour they were. For instance, <em>Sinosauropteryx</em> would have likely looked <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Sinosauropteryx_color.jpg" target="_blank">like this</a>. The most famous examples are probably <em>Microraptor,</em> which was covered in iridescent black feathers, and would have resembled a crow with jaws, arms, and a tail, (think a tiny <em>Velociraptor</em>) and <em>Borealopelta,</em> which had reddish-brown skin (think an <em>Ankylosaurus</em> without the tail club). </p>
<p>Also, as a side note, other prehistoric reptiles may have also possessed feathers- pterosaurs often had downy protofeathers (similar to a duckling), whereas marine reptiles such as plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs had smooth skin.</p>
<p>I’ve attached some depictions of what dinosaurs (along with a couple of other prehistoric animals they coexisted with) probably looked like with their integument intact:</p>

<p>But a lot of the really early estimates were really just assumptions based on superficial similarity to traits with modern lizards and crocodiles.</p>
<p>For the archaeopteryx, they've recently concluded that the <a href="https://www.science20.com/news_articles/how_to_determine_the_color_of_the_ancient_archaeopteryx_wing-148686" target="_blank">feathers were black in color</a>.
