		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The biggest issue has been with natural gas and coal plants shutting down due to equipment malfunctioning from the cold.  It wasn't built for extended temperatures THIS cold.</p>
<p>The infrastructure was built to withstand the sweltering heat and produce enough electricity to run all the AC.</p>
<p>Electricity is produced on a just in time method.  If there is a sudden spike in demand, then the plants have to ramp up production in real time.  At the same time that power plants started ramping up for demand, they stalled and stopped producing.  Demand continued to grow and they couldn't produce enough.  The grid can pull from other close regions, but if all the regions have the same issue then you are stuck without power.  That's all of Texas for a second day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in the petroleum industry in Norway. During design of the electrical utilities we have to factor in winterization of the process systems, which means that a lot needs to be heat traced and insulated. Depending on the process you might get slush or hydrates if the temperature gets too low, which in turn can plug pipes and whatnot. Also, much of the gas needs to be &quot;dried&quot; which in turn is done through large heaters - and I am guessing the texan ones are not especially winterized.</p>
<p>Edit: Electrical engineer so I do very little in the process systems, just make sure they are kept within temperature specs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cause #1: Heating increased demand for natural gas beyond design capacity.
Cause #2: Natural gas well heads and infrastructure froze due to lack of winterization causing drop in supply -&gt; electricity generator shutdown
Cause #3: Gas supply shortage causes massive spike in spot prices on the open market, impacts ability to economically meet rates (i.e. cost to produce much higher than price to sell)
Cause #4: Majority of TX grid is independent due to decision to operate outside of federal regulations, this limits ability to get electricity from neighbors and allowed infrastructure standards below federal levels (e.g. not even Basic winter preparedness both for gas and renewable infrastructure - both are working fine in northern states)
Cause #5: we entered a feedback loop whereby people trying to stay warm chased and overloaded available fuel sources for heat generation causing cascading failure in the overall energy supply system </p>
<p>Irony #1: wind has actually produced more electricity during this event than it typically does during February.
Irony #2: By isolating itself to eliminate federal regulations, TX effectively reduced it's grid reliability and recoverability. While this saved operators a money (a small portion of which was passed on to consumers), it's the consumers who are likely to beat a majority of the cost from the resultant damage (both damage to their personal property and repair costs for damaged energy infrastructure).</p>
<p>If you care to, see how El Paso fared, which is not participating in the texas grid vs well almost all the rest of texas. It's a great showcase that while market driven core infrastructure is in my opinion beneficial, market driven infrastructure without (consumer protecting) regulation is a house of cards and in all cases the consumers are the ones who pay for the price of its failure while it's operators continue to take profits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to other correct answers, the reason why the demand is so high is that Texas homes are not designed to have high efficiency heat systems. Rather than a gas furnace for example, they will have a heat pump and optionally heat strips; both of which are not very efficient when it comes to very cold temperatures. As a result, these units are on almost all the time to keep up and some never do. So the power demand is much higher than the system was designed for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are not experiencing a problem with demand. The problem is the energy companies never bothered to winterize any of their utilities.</p>
<p>They wanted to blame wind turbines freezing (yeah like the biggest oil procing state uses mostly wind), but that AND natural gas pipes that fed the power plants froze over. </p>
<p>Just nothing there was meant to be used in sustained cold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
