		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First thing to note is that while we have phase 1 and 2 data for several of the early vaccine candidates we have no phase 3 data, which is where vaccines shows how effective they are. Some of the ones we hope will work may not prove to work or they could show bad adverse events in a larger population. Phase 1 and 2 have had less than 1000 people in most cases and in many cases less than 100. A vaccine that hurts 1:10,000 people is not going to be used in all probability. We won't know that until phase 3. </p>
<p>When you can relax some restrictions within a population depends on 5 main factors: R0 of the pathogen, the length of immunity from natural infection, the population that has had it naturally, the effectiveness of the vaccine, the fraction of people who take it. </p>
<p>Your goal is to get the total number of people in your population over the so called herd immunity threshold. That depends on R0 of the pathogen and also on the heterogeneity of your population (do old people only hang out with old people, or do people mix).  From that society movement you can get an effective R0 which would tell you the basic effective level of immunity you need in the population to get R0_effective &lt; 1 which would prevent epidemics but not people getting sick still.</p>
<p>Let's say the effective R0 requires 60% of the population to be immune to get under 1 for R0_effective. Let's say you live in the US where in a lot of places about 10% of the population has already had COVID and let's assume that natural immunity is long-ish lasting based on T-Cell results from SARS-COV-1. In that case we need 50% more immune people. Let's say we get a vaccine with 80% effectiveness then we need about 62% of the population to take such a vaccine to get to the level we are targeting. (0.62*0.8 \~= 0.5). For the US in total that means we would need 217 million doses. </p>
<p>80% effective is rosy for how effective this vaccine might be. The FDA has indicated it would give a EUA for 50% effective. Clearly you can't get to 60% immune with a 50% effective vaccine. </p>
<p>Don't get too too sad though, even if you don't get to R0_effective &lt; 1 everyone who does it a vaccine reduces the rate of spread. </p>
<p>Ball park you will need 75% of your population to get a vaccine to really go back to normal. That will happen if the current candidates make it through phase 3 sometime in the middle of 2021 in rich western democracies. It will happen by 2022 for everyone. If every candidate works then maybe you get there by very late 2021, but I'm skeptical, you need 5-6 billion doses. If you thought testing for COVID was hard...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. It will take a long time for the vaccine to deploy, especially to countries that have poorer economies and inadequate healthcare systems.  In addition, if travel is less restricted, community transmission will continue to be a risk. Nobody really knows when the right time to open up will be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It helps to understand the scale involved.  If vaccine development successfully finishes on October 1 and they can make a million doses a day (which may be optimistic, but they’re trying to get a jump on production before trials finish), then there will be 92 million doses manufactured by New Years.  If every single batch meets quality control standards (seems unlikely to be that perfect), every single one goes to a member of the public in need (which assumes that the distribution is efficient), every dose works and creates an immunity (doubtful), and none of those people get sick before the vaccine immunity is in place (risky), the 92 million people will be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Using US numbers as an example, that still leaves 240 million people unvaccinated, who will be at risk if we push to reopen faster.  Further, that assumes that all doses go to Americans, which is extraordinarily selfish and will absolutely burn critical international bridges.</p>
<p>At a million doses produced, QCed, delivered a day, it will take another 240 days (end of August 2021) to cover everyone else in the country.  To reach decent herd immunity levels, maybe we only need 90% of the population (maybe 300 million total), which gets us to late July 2021 instead (this year’s 92 mill and 208 mill next year).</p>
<p>To cover the world as a whole with that level of herd immunity will require 7 <em>billion</em> doses (~90% of 7.8 billion).  At a million a day, that’s 7000 days, or 19 years.  100% coverage adds another 2 1/2 years.</p>
<p>Now, in reality, things aren’t going to go that smoothly.  But in our favor, we can expect massive increases over early production numbers as new plants in multiple countries come online and the process grows more efficient.  But we also probably won’t start at a million a day, either.</p>
<p>My point is that it’s going to take considerable time for any novel vaccine to be produced and rolled out in sufficient numbers to cover a material percentage of the public, and you can bet that nearly every nation on the planet will be squabbling to get their fair share (or more).  That will make it difficult for any one nation to quickly reach sufficient herd immunity, let alone 100% coverage.  And that doesn’t account for setbacks like issues during trials or production, espionage (corporate or otherwise), sabotage (do you really think agents from our enemies won’t attempt to prolong this crisis), politics, antivaxxers and 5G conspiracy theorists, and so on.  I mean, with the way this year has gone, I could totally see someone bombing the factory because of Bill Gates RFID chip tracking crazy.</p>
<p>Depending on how the vaccine is rolled out, some areas may be able to open quickly.  For example, if hard-hit cities get enough early on (to stem the tide), maybe that will help stall the pandemic and we can reopen those cities.  If everyone was to start wearing their masks and keeping distance, we could open before the vaccine’s ready.  If first responders and critical personnel get it first, then we can’t reopen, but we’ll stop hemorrhaging those lives at least, and it will help the rest of survive.  But let’s be honest...in the US, the wealthy and mega wealthy will get two doses each...</p>
<p>Edit:  Holy moly!!  Thank you all for the awards.  I’m stunned, flattered, and grateful!  I’m glad I could post something you found of such value - thank you!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>yes because the problem is, even with a vaccine available, people need to actually get it. studies show that at least 75% of the population need to have it for herd immunity to be effective. considering only about 45% of the population bother to get the flu vaccine, there’s going to be a real challenge there, especially if the federal government is unwilling to support it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
