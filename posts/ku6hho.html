		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The word nebula (in its original root and in common astrophotography use) just means fuzzy thing in space. There are loads of different types that formed in different ways and each will have a different set of conditions it formed in. The easiest to explain would be bubble or ring like shapes which are caused by something pushing material away. Depending on the size that could be a young star, an older massive star with strong winds, and exploding dying star, or a whole cluster of stars, and that's just thinking in our Galaxy. The exact shape depends on gravity, radiation, magnetic fields, shocks, environment... This is an open area of research so there isn't a definitive answer yet.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I study the morphology of the interstellar medium, and the answer is: it’s very complicated! Many of the classical nebulae are the result material being pushed out of stars by a variety of processes and then being lit up by the host star or other stars in the environment. In this case, the way material is ejected, how it interacts with previous ejected material and other circumstellar material, and how it is illuminated all contribute to it’s appearance.</p>
<p>On larger scales forces of gravity, turbulence, magnetization, pressure from photons, and collisions of flows of interstellar material also play a role. Pulling these effects apart, and figuring out how to interpret this these shapes is a lot of what I do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are talking about gas formations nebula (sometimes nebula is describing globular clusters) its friction.</p>
<p>Well there is some indication friction, ionization and magnetic fields. Friction is what kicks off planetary formation (before gravity) and allows for this initial clumping.</p>
<p>A nebula shape is effected by solar winds as well but the friction dictates how it clumps into the sub structures.</p>
<p>Its kinda hard to explain... but just think of it as ink clouds in a water tank (different rules of physics)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interesting question, i can't give a scientific answer to this, but i think since they're explosions, there could be 2 factors effecting their shape. First would be the initial conditions or why they exploded in the first place, how they exploded and what else was included in the process. If it was triggered by a collision etc would certainly play a role, or if the star ran out of fuel, collapsed on it's gravity, or it was expanding and swallowed a bunch of planets which could later result in irregularities that could effect it's shape. The other factor i can think of is the gravity fields they're exposed to, which would force the debris to move on the curved space and take some shape. Jupiter alone can shape the asteroid belts in the solar system, so gravity is probably involved in the final shapes they take. If the sun was to explode, i think a planet as massive as jupiter would certainly play a role in the shape of nebulae it would create. </p>
<p>One type of nebulae i know are the planetary nebulas, i think they're formed when stars are expanding in their late stages of lives, they eject their outer layers while expanding, and the resulting shape is mostly spherical, hence they get the name planetary nebula. They aren't perfect spheres though, but this is somewhat a more slow process, and could explain why these nebulae show somewhat spheroids rather than irregular chaotic shapes which as result of some more violent and rapid processes.</p>
<p>Most nebulae are either stars forming, dying or evolving. These processes contain tremendous amount of energy, and many factors could be effecting their shapes. But i think initial conditions and gravitational fields they're exposed to afterwards would have some effect on their shapes. They have very chaotic natures, and the conditions they exist in could mean that even a small cause early in the creation could result in the complex shapes they take after as an effect, so i think butterfly effect would also be playing a role here. Consider that they exist in the vacuum of space, or atmospheric pressure around them, and dense structures are far far away. So any material cloud that's ejected out as a result of the explosion would only get effected by planets, stars or other systems around it, or the initial conditions of the explosion that created it in the first place.</p>
<p>But this is just my guess and not a well researched answer from an expert of astronomy. My only experiance with astronomy is that i like shooting astrophotography as a hobby, lol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
