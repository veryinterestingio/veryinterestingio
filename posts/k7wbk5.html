		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. Objects tend towards stability. For a two - body orbit like the Earth - Moon system, tidal locking is often the most stable. Its already happened with the moon, and the moon is slowing the earth's rotation, boosting itself into a higher orbit all the while. The sun will die before that process completes, so this question is only really interesting for red dwarf planetary systems, whose lifetimes are measured in trillions of years. But lets pretend the sun is immortal and that orbits have time to reach a steady state. Then the Earth and Moon would indeed eventually tidally lock, with the Earth having &gt;month long days. </p>
<p>But what about the Sun-Earth-Moon system? The Moon tidally locking the Earth and the Earth tidally locking the Sun mean the Earth and Moon are co-orbiting the Sun, in constant conjunction, with the Moon at one the Earth-Sun Lagrange points. This is feasible at L4 and L5 (the Trojan and Greek asteroids orbit at L4 and L5 of the Sun - Jupiter system) but those are so far away that normal tidal adjustments to orbit have virtually no chance of putting the Moon there - the most likely candidates are L1 and L2, but those are unstable so tiny perturbations would push the Moon into a different orbit. Which means that, assuming an immortal sun and no other perturbation, the Sun-Earth-Moon system will settle into some other steady state. My guess is some kind of very slow resonance between the rotation of earth, the orbit of earth, and the orbit of the moon, with the Earth having a somewhat longer year and days on the order of a few months. </p>
<p>Look up the orbital resonances of the Galilean moons. They already have a nice stability between their orbits (sort of unrelated to tidal locking, though I think Io is, but gives a sense of the sort of thing I'm suggesting).</p>
<p>Edit: accuracy about Jupiters asteroids.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. Neither of mars' moons will do this. Phobos is being pulled towards the Mars and will eventually reach the roche limit and break apart creating a ring for a while, eventually raining down on Mars. Deimos is drifting away from mars and will likely escape Mars' gravity eventually.</p>
<p>Also the earth and other planets are too far from the sun to become tidally locked.</p>
<p>The moon is big enough that if given enough time the earth would tidally locked to the moon as well. But as the sun ages it will expand and that is likely to cause the moon to move back towards the earth. So it's fate will likely be like phobos. There is a chance that the earth:s orbit will expand enough to avoid being consumed by the sun. if this happens and the moon survives as well then we will go back to the moon and earth becoming tidally locked. When this happens only one half of the earth will see the moon and a day on the earth will be 47 days!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>No. Tidal locking is not an end state. Tidal equilibrium is</strong> (made bold because this is an important point that all other answers so far have missed).  The subtle difference is that body 1 can tidally lock to body 2 while body 2 is not locked to body 1 (such as the case for the Earth-Moon system). So straight off the bat tidal locking is not an end state it is simply an intermediate state. Another way of putting this is a tidal lock is not a minimum energy state while tidal equilibrium is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Resonances are also not really end states. They are stable to perturbations of some orbital parameters, so for example Mercury and the Sun are in a 3:2 resonance (as a point this is not tidal locking or tidal equilibrium, it is a resonance, distinct things by the same processes. In particular tidal locking is a special type of resonance, the 1-1 resonance) but given time accumulation of perturbations to other parameters can break resonance (in the case of Mercury the planet is unstable on timescales of the order of the age of the Sun which is why the Solar system is regarded as marginally stable and not stable).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What about in the limit of infinite time? It is highly unlikely systems would reach full tidal equilibrium (which by its nature is an asymptotic process anyway). The key mechanism in tidal locking/tidal equilibrium/resonances/migration is dissipation of the tidal energy. There are many different ways to dissipate tidal energy which depend on the planetary and stellar bodies. Since they evolve in time so too does the amount of dissipation (and hence the rate of evolution). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What about for the 3 body system. Well it turns out that this is unlikely to work out either. Recent work on tidal equilibrium of a star-planet-moon system found that it is highly unlikely that the moon and planet can reach tidal equilibrium with each other (not even caring about locking to the star). Reason being is the orbital separation would be such that the moons orbit would end up migrating far enough that the stars influence would dominate over the planets. So the Earth-Moon system will not reach tidal equilibrium even if the Sun had an infinite lifetime as the Earths influence over the Moon will be lost before it migrates far enough for tidal equilibrium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further complications come from competing dissipative mechanisms. See for example the Sun-Venus system. Technically Venus is tidally locked to the Sun despite its slow retrograde rotation. Why? Well this is because the atmospheric tide and the regular tide act in opposite directions. Venus is likely very close to a balance between the two and could hence be considered tidally locked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything I have mentioned so far also just considers conventional wisdom for tides. It completely neglects anti-dissipation (also known as inverse tides and a few other names) which has been demonstrated to be possible by two separate mechanisms (within the past year or so) of tidal dissipation . What this means is that it is possible that a system would evolve in the opposite direction as we would normally think (so for example the Moon would actually be migrating towards Earth).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, despite tidal equilibrium (NOT just locking) being regarded as an end state it is not an indefinite one and is by no means guaranteed. Note Pluto-Charon  as an example of tidal equilibrium as both are mutually locked to each other (and that system is sufficiently isolated) so it can occur. It is most likely to happen in systems that can effectively be described as 2 body systems, so distant double planets like Pluto-Charon or binary stars (quite common for binaries on sub 10 day orbits).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit to add. In many systems tidal equilibrium is not even a possible end state. In such systems the spin and orbital momentum ratios are such that one of the bodies will either be ejected or collide with another (due to migrating into it).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you had an isolated star and planet, the true end state is the planet spirals into the star from emission of gravitational waves. This process takes about 10^20 years.</p>
<p>In practice, interactions with passing stars or between the orbits of multiple planets will disrupt the planetary orbits within a mere 10^15 years or so.</p>

<p>Its a bit deep but more or less states that most bodies will achieve synchronous rotation with the parent body. With the right information the time it takes can be calculated (estimated). Major effects are the obliqueness of the two bodies, as well as the mass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
