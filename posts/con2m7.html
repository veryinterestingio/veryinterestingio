		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've always learned that the tidal pull of the moon has made life on Earth possible. Beyond the tides themselves being important for many ecosystems, it is also my understanding that without the moon there wouldn't be ocean currents (correct me if I'm wrong). Without ocean currents stirring arctic and tropical waters, the weather would be a lot less predictable, and the Earth would be generally less habitable. </p>
<p>My question then is, how would two moons (for argument's sake let's say of relatively equal mass and rotational period) impact the tides and the currents? Would the pull of the two moons cancel each other out, leaving us in a tideless wasteland similar to if we had no moon at all? Would the tidal forces just be amplified by the second moon? Or would something else entirely happen? Thanks in advance for your replies!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ocean currents are driven by heating from the Sun.</p>
<p>Two moons of similar mass with the same orbital period are not stable. But if we magically move them around: They would produce the same tide pattern as one moon, just with a different amplitude (which would depend on their orientation). At 0 or 180 degree separation they add up, at 90 degree separation they cancel each other.</p>
<p>What you can have is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_(moon\)" target="_blank">Janus</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimetheus_(moon\)" target="_blank">Epimetheus</a> configuration: They have slightly different orbits. As the lower moon approaches the upper one in its orbit the mutual gravitational attraction makes the lower moon go to the upper orbit and vice versa: They swap orbits (not exactly as they don't have the same mass). The new lower moon is orbiting faster until it made one extra orbit and approaches the upper moon from behind and the cycle repeats. This happens every four years. Such a configuration around Earth this would mean the intensity of tides would vary with a period of two years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing you've missed that I've read about is having a moon helps the earth remain stable in its tilt upon its axis. Most planets &quot;wobble&quot; and can move anywhere from 0-90 degrees, while we're stable at 23 degrees.</p>
<p>If we wobbled like other planets (which does take several thousand years to happen) we wouldn't have stable seasons (among other things).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reply by u/mfb describes the tidal effects accurately if our planet were to suddenly have its two moons replaced by one in recent time. One thing we don’t really know is how important the Moon might have been to Earth’s early development. The fact that Earth and Venus have similar masses, distances from the sun, and (probably) similar (primordial) elemental compositions while having shockingly different resulting atmospheres is an open question. The process by which the Earth ended up with a relatively thin (and therefore cool) atmosphere as well as being our soul observed example of plate tectonics may be tightly tied up in the formation and existence of our moon. (Look up the “giant impact hypothesis”.) Whatever this process might be, it may have depended importantly on only a single large moon with larger tidal forces. It’s an open question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Humans are good at telling if a circle is more than half full or less than half full, but no other fractions really. Nearly every culture in history has used a 7 day week (with a few notable exceptions), and it’s thanks to our (1) moon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
