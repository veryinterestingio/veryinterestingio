		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve always been curious as to how the body seems to heal different issues primarily during sleep, for example I’ve had a few sebaceous cysts in my life and they’re always noticeably smaller when I wake up whereas while I’m awake I can’t generally tell if anything has happened at all. Or even say the dentist, had a few wisdom teeth pulled one tike and each consecutive day after sleep the pain / swelling has been reduced drastically.
I also have RA and most of the pain / swelling is always gone or reduced in the morning compared to the previous day / night ? In some sense it’s almost like my disease has been ‘reset’.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to less time and energy being spent moving around and being awake, you also do not notice things while you are asleep.  During the day, changes happen over a few hours are small enough that you might not notice, but being asleep for eight hours (plus however long before you fell asleep) allows those changes to add up.</p>
<p>It is similar to how you might not notice how much a younger sibling grows when you see them every day, but if you are gone for a summer, you will notice the change.</p>
<p>RA is a completely different story, but it may just be that laying down and relaxing completely allows your body to reset.  Then, as you go through your day, mental and physical stress, as well as the movement of the affected joints, adds up to cause discomfort.  It is a little puzzling, since RA is an autoimmune disorder, and I would think it would be worse while you are asleep, since your immune system can be more active, but it might be that with RA, it is joint movement that causes the immune system to attack.  (Now that I think about it, someone I know with Crohn's disease, which is similar to RA in many ways, also seems to be in more pain later in the day, and seems to be in better shape first thing in the mornings.)</p>
<p>Hopefully, someone who knows more about RA/autoimmune disorders and the effects of sleep on the immune system can help us understand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, the sleep cycle and circadian rhythm partly regulates the immune system. During the day, immune cells are searching the body for pathogenic invaders. At night, more energy is put into processes like healing and antibody production. It's controlled by brain-body communication, hormone and cytokine signalling, and gene expression.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a great book on this a few years ago, Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker. I haven't read it yet, but it was hugely popular and influential, and as you might guess from the fact it's a book and not an article: a LOT happens when we sleep. </p>
<p>I know less about the physiology, so maybe someone else can speak to that, but neurologically, it's when your brain does its housekeeping and bookkeeping, basically. If when you went to bed, the day's events were a big messy pile of papers on the table, during sleep is when your brain sorts through them all, throws out the junk mail, files away the important stuff (memory formation), even noodles on some of the unsolved items (REM sleep). </p>
<p>FYI insomniacs, meditation replicates many of the beneficial wave states and activities of sleep, so if you're not sleeping well, try a few minutes of simple meditation if you can. Bonus: It'll also potentially help you sleep better later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the body is not occupied with other activities—such as thinking, moving or digesting, other processes will get prioritized. </p>
<p>Immune and healing functions are particularly enhanced if you make a point of going to bed on an empty stomach.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>James Herriot (British vet) wrote about a seriously ill sheep that a farmer wanted put out of his misery. Dr. Herriot administered the euthanasia drug to the sheep in a remote shed and left the farm.</p>
<p>Dr. Herriot returned to the farm a few weeks later for something and the farmer pointed to a sheep peacefully grazing in the field and said “remember her?”</p>
<p>Apparently the sheep was out for a few days and for whatever reason not buried. When the farmer finally went to do that, he found her alive and well...</p>
<p>Dr. Herriot’s theory was that the sheep just needed a break from the pain so that her sleeping body could work on healing itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
