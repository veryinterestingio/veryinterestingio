		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like everyone is saying, it's a matter of different cross-sectional areas and equal volumes causes a velocity differential.</p>
<p>But I feel like that's not really answering ops question. Given a perfectly symmetric fan blade (front to back) why would it be different?</p>
<p>Essentially, it's because while the blades are actively pushing air in a forward direction through direct application of force, there's no way to do the same to &quot;pull&quot; air. </p>
<p>The only way to pull air is to create a low pressure zone which by it's very nature has omni-directional influence.</p>
<p>Edit: I just realized what sub I'm in.</p>
<p>Think about it like pushing your hand through sand or snow. You can actively push the sand forward and it will clump up and move a bit ahead of your hand mostly in one direction. But you can't pull the material along with you. Instead you create a gap (low pressure zone) that fills in from sand/snow slumping I'm from the sides. Fans do something similar with air. They can push air forward but can't pull air from the back. Instead they create a gap which air &quot;slumps&quot; into.</p>
<p>Or picture sand falling down an hour glass. You can see and you could feel the sand quickly falling in a narrow stream, but you can barely notice or feel movement in the top section.</p>
<p>Edit2: Because this has gained some traction people have pointed out errors in this explanation. I appreciate that and I want to be very clear that every analogy in physics is usually wrong as the actual mathematics is far more complex. Any thought experiment is only the first stepping off point into understanding the world around us. As you gain a deeper understanding you can leave behind every earlier approximation. </p>
<p>Please read through the disagreements and oppositional arguments below to gain further insight into this phenomenon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Outflow is getting pushed in one direction while inflow is grabbing from everywhere. That's why a vacuum can go from doing nothing to being stuck on your hand, drapes, carpet, etc. Goes from a small pulling force all over to all the pulling force being just at the opening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/ecYHiUK.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/ecYHiUK.png</a></p>
<p>The air that's blown against your hand is directly hitting your skin, where you feel it. This also feels cold, because the air is directly taking away any moisture and warmth radiating from your hand.</p>
<p>On the reverse side, you barely feel it because the air isn't hitting your hand, but being drawn from around it and between your fingers. If your hand had many holes in it, like a colander, you would feel it much easier. This is why it feels so weird.</p>
<p>Picture above to illustrate.</p>

<p>Hope my answer is satisfactory! :3</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What freaks me out is when every so often, though the fan is still turning and connected to the power, there will be a little gap that lasts a few seconds when I can't feel the wind. I now keep a Bic lighter by the fan so I can light it and see if the flame moves, so I know I'm not losing my mind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
