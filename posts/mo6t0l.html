		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine two scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>A: a real-life city with tall buildings, photographed by a drone and</li>
<li>B: a miniature version of the same city, photographed from the same angle to look roughly the same as A.</li>
</ul>
<p>In A, everything would be sharp, because everything is far away from the camera.</p>
<p>In B, you could focus on the top of the buildings, making the streets blurry, because the tops of the buildings are so very close to the camera (because it's a miniature and you had to go very close to it).</p>
<p>Try it out with your eyes: hold your finger close to your eye and look at it. The stuff behind it will be very blurry. Now look at something further away. The stuff behind it won't be nearly as blurry.</p>
<p>So what if you take a wide angle shot of a big, real-life city, and make the tops of the buildings sharp and the street blurry? Well, you can &quot;cheat&quot; and trick your mind into thinking that it's tiny. That's it.</p>
<p>You can do this in Photoshop or you can do it with a tilt-shift camera. The two will result in a very similar effect in this particular example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It comes down to the depth of field, which is the term for what is in focus in the shot. There is a single point where the image is focused on, and then the depth of field is how far in front of that point, and how far behind that point is in sharp focus, before fading to blurry out-of-focus look.</p>
<p>One aspect of a camera lens is called the aperture, which is the size of the opening that lets light into the camera. The aperture can usually be opened or closed, to allow more or less light in, and also to widen or narrow the amount of space that is in focus for the shot. When the aperture is made small, the depth of field gets wider, so a small hole means that lots of your scene will look in focus. Conversely, if you set a wide aperture, the depth of field is much more narrow, which is how photographers get the blurry backgrounds on portraits.</p>
<p>Another thing that affects the depth of field is how far away your focus point is. If you point your camera at a building half a mile away, focusing that far away will mean that you have a very wide depth of field, and almost everything in your scene will be very sharply focused. If you leave all the camera settings the same, but simply re-focus your shot on something very close, like a rock in your hand in front of the camera, being so close to you will make the depth of field very very narrow. The rock will be in focus, but things behind it will get blurry much more quickly.</p>
<p>That distance factor is what causes tilt shift miniature photos to have their effect. Your mind subconsciously knows that to have a blurry foreground, and a blurry background, with a narrow strip of focus in between and a very quick transition from in focus to out of focus means that you're very close to something, and therefore, if you're very close to a scene, but it has things like buildings and cars and people in it, those must be very very small to fit into the frame, so your brain decides that it's a miniature.</p>
<p>It's also worth knowing that this miniature effect is not the intended use of a tilt-shift lens. There is no &quot;wrong&quot; way to use a tool to make what you want to make, but the <em>intended</em> use of a tilt-shift lens is to help with things like architectural photography, where you want to stand on the ground and take a photo of a building without having some of it go out of focus because the top of the building is further away from you than the bottom of the building. So you can use the clever mechanics of the lens to adjust the plane of focus so that isn't always a flat perpendicular plane from you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simplified answer - because if you shot a miniature scene from close up it would look like this - blurry (out-of-focus) top and bottom, sharp (in-focus) middle. Your brain 'knows' this, so when it sees sees a picture with this effect, it 'assumes' it's a miniature.</p>
<p>If you shot a real-life representation of that scene, you would do so from further away and everything would be in-focus which your brain would take as a sign that you're not looking at a miniature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wanted to add one thing that hasn't quite been fully articulated:</p>
<p>Tilt and shift are two different functions that typical come together in one lens. Tilt is the ability to change the angle of the lens so that it's no longer parallel with the image sensor (which normal lenses are). Shift is moving the lens up and down relative to the image sensor (in normal lenses, the center of the lens is in line with the center of the image sensor). They can be used together or independently. The faux miniature effect you're asking about is caused by the tilt function in particular.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In every photo, the camera lens has a certain distance range where objects appear in focus, know as &quot;depth of field&quot;. </p>
<p>When taking a picture of large objects, say a mountain range, there won't be a noticeable difference in the focus of a mountain 3 km away compared to another 4 km away. This is because the depth of field is long and far away.</p>
<p>When taking a picture of small objects, the camera's depth of field will need to be smaller and the focus will be closer. So if an object 5 cm away from the camera is in focus, another object at 15 cm will be totally blurry.</p>
<p>This contrast of focus/blur within a photo is typical in pictures of small objects, and has become recognizable to us as a macro shot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
