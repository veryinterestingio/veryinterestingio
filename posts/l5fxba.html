		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to one of the Israeli health providers, in the week after their second shot, just 20 out of 128,000 Israelis tested positive. This is 0.015%, compared to the 0.65% of the general population who are currently getting infected each week. This would suggest an efficacy of around 95% as claimed by Pfizer. None of the 20 were hospitalised. </p>
<p>The effect after a single dose is significantly smaller (and apparently less than Pfizer was claiming), though it still reduces infections by around a third. </p>
<p>Overall infections among over 60s have dropped very significantly compared to the rest of the (still mostly unvaccinated) population. This has coincided with the British virus variant becoming more widespread in Israel, leading to an increase in infections among younger people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are probably talking about 42 doses per 100 people. All the vaccine trackers use this figure, I am not sure why because it is not very informative.</p>
<p>The exact, up to date, numbers are:</p>
<p>29% got the first shot.</p>
<p>13.5% got the second shot.</p>
<p><a href="https://datadashboard.health.gov.il/COVID-19/general" target="_blank"><a href="https://datadashboard.health.gov.il/COVID-19/general" target="_blank">https://datadashboard.health.gov.il/COVID-19/general</a></a></p>
<p>I think another interesting figure would be what percentage got the the second shot X or more days ago where X is the number of days it takes to get maximum immunity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm seeing a lot of incorrect information and missunderstanding around the effectiveness of the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. </p>
<p>There are numbers of both 52% and 90%, these are both correct but refer to different things.</p>
<p>If you view figure 1. In this source </p>
<p><a href="https://www.cas.mhra.gov.uk/ViewandAcknowledgment/ViewAttachment.aspx?Attachment_id=103741P" target="_blank">https://www.cas.mhra.gov.uk/ViewandAcknowledgment/ViewAttachment.aspx?Attachment_id=103741P</a></p>
<p>You can see that the placebo group and active group diverge after 14 days. That is, the vaccine takes around 14 days to act. This is the key difference in the values.</p>
<p>The 52% is the figure if you measure from the moment of the first dose being administered.</p>
<p>The 90% is the figure if you measure from 14 days after the first dose was administered, i.e after the vaccine kicks in.</p>
<p>The vaccine isn't an instant cure, it takes time to act. But even after one dose it is highly effective.</p>

<p>Only 20 cases of infection after the second shot were registered, comprising 0.012%, iirc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes some possible effects on cases and hospitalizations in early vaccinated population (healthcare workers &amp; 60+ age group) are now being seen by comparing trajectory in this lockdown to the last one. It's not a perfectly controlled experiment, but it's promising so far.
