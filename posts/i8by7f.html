If it works in e.g. nuclear power plants with a closed loop, why not in a locomotive?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mainly, because in most cases it wasn't worth it. Water is cheap, and mostly everywhere. And they got some benefit from the waste steam - the used steam was blown up the chimney in a jet, which drew air along with it, pulling the fire through the boiler and more air into the fire - which meant that the fire would burn more fuel and the boiler produce more steam the harder the engine ran.</p>
<p>But in places where water was scarce, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensing_steam_locomotive" target="_blank">condensing steam locomotives</a> were used.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Most steam trains didn't actually need to stop to resupply water either. The flying scotsman and mallard for example was fitted with a water scoop and at certain points along the east coast mainline there would be water troughs. First class where kindly informed to close the windows before they got soaked. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can speak from a stationary steam perspective, which I may or may not apply to locomotive (train) engines as well: In stationary steam engines, there are drips of oil that are inserted into the ingress pipe before the valvebox. The methods to do this are clever and numerous, as many 18th/19th century problems ended up with lots of brainpower pointed at them (displacement, mechanical injector, venturi injector... etc.)</p>
<p>This oil lubricates the slides of the valves, and also the cylinder itself, as there is no splash lubrication or other method to get oil in between the cylinder rings and piston sleeve. (Well, there were some engines using spray injectors or other fragile systems, but they were atypical - I am betting locomotives have additional methods for lubrication.)  So this oil then exits in the exhaust stroke and is mixed with the rapidly-cooling steam. The oil in itself is not a problem in the system at low volumes if recycled, but if you were to mix that oil back into the boiler, it would float on the top of the water and accumulate in a &quot;scum ring&quot; around the top of the water level where the heat from the fire was highest. This would cause either a thick nasty goo of oil to need to be removed frequently, or would (if the engine had a superheater which was hot enough) coke on the inside of the pipes, making removal exceptionally difficult.  There are special oil/water separators for this purpose on some engine installations that recycle the water but it is often imperfect. Doing this at &quot;locomotive&quot; scale and speed would be difficult given the constraints of size and weight, I suspect.</p>
<p>The oil itself for my &quot;low pressure&quot; needs is tallow oil, and while there may be man-made substitutes these days I have only ever seen tallow oil for sale in any of the catalogs that I frequent.  There are discussions about using tallow vs castor oil vs mineral oil - the reader can fall into those rabbit holes if they have time.</p>
<p>The arguments about efficiency, size of radiator required and other points are all also valid.  This is just yet another reason not to re-use the water or which requires lots of engineering to solve this problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
