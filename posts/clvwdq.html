<p>The last thing you want is your tooth to rust or dissolve. Gold is so unreactive it doesn't even have a flavour.</p>
<p>It's also valuable so can be seen as a display of wealth. </p>
<p>There are more practical things, and they're generally what your dentist will use today. Silver amalgams, plastic, ceramic or special types of glass are used today for fillings and dentures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gold dental restorations are the (pun intended) gold standard.  There are wonderful advancements happening all the time in dental materials but the old adage is still true: If it's ugly, it will last (gold, silver amalgam) If its pretty, it will need to be replaced someday.  There isn't another material with the same biocompatibility of dental gold alloy: non-reactivity, similar coefficients of wear, expansion, etc. as natural tooth.  There is no true replacement for natural enamel.  No such thing as good as new.  It therefore makes sense to remove as little tooth material as possible: make an inlay or onlay instead of a full crown.  Gold is the very best material for partial coverage restorations and partial coverage restorations are the epitome of dental bioengineering.</p>
<p>Disclosure: I am along with most everyone else in my family, in the in the dental field.</p>
<p>Note: with all my dental family members, time and money are not considerations when getting dental work.  We can get whatever we want, whenever we like.  All of us choose partial gold restorations for our molars.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am in my late 50's, when I was in college I went to a dental college and they gave me a gold crown on a molar. A dental student's graduation requirement, I think dentists had stop using gold by then. Over the years I was embarrassed by it, looked like I was from the old country. Since then I have had an expensive crown or two more and a few invisible fillings. I have had a few problems/replacements with these, but the gold crown has been problem free.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before advancements in dental materials, gold was used because of its accessibility and biocompatibility.  Also, it being a soft dental alloy, it was not harmful to opposing dentition.  There are other materials available now days that are less expensive and more aesthetic.  Full Gold Crowns have been replaced by Zirconia Crowns.  Yet, there are still situations where a full metal crown is applicable.</p>
<p>When your dentist removes tooth structure to make room for a crown, there are specific thickness's needed to make room for different types of restorations.  For example, a Porcelain Fused to Metal crown.  The doctors know they need to make room for .3-.5mm for metal, .2mm for opaque ceramic to block out the grey metal, and .5-1mm of porcelain.  But sometimes there just isn't enough enamel or dentin to make enough room.  So a gold crown being only one material with a minimum thickness of .5mm will suffice.  Or, a harder metal made of nickel or chrome cobalt at .3mm thickness.</p>
<p>The different types of restorations available all have manufacture specified recommended thicknesses.  And the doctor needs to follow these guidelines or the restoration may fail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Except for color and cost gold is the perfect material for dental use. </p>
<p>A) gold doesn’t rust or degrade in a wet environment with varying PH of materials passimg through(the mouth), few materials can remain perfect in such a place for decades.
B) gold does not taste to the patient so it does not effect enjoyment of eating (try sucking on a penny)
C) gold can be cast with very fine tolerances at a lowish temperature and will hold its shape even when it is quite thin. This means one does not have to cut away much tooth to prepare a crown.
D) gold is ductile, meaning it deforms under pressure so it doesn’t wear opposing teeth.
E) gold isn’t rare, it has been used by humans for thousands of years and finding craftsman who could use the material was not a problem</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
