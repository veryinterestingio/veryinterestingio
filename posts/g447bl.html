		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm <strong>very</strong> curious, it's why I'm so fine with not knowing everything, because I know I'm learning a lot on the way.</p>
<p>I <strong>love</strong> my curiousity.
One second I'm researching about x and the other y.
I like that I learn about different things all the time, be that through books or online through documentaries.</p>
<p><strong>BUT</strong>
Even if I know I'm right, when it comes across to explain my view I seem to forget my facts, freeze up, and then come across as some idiot who clearly doesn't know what she's talking about. </p>
<p>I'm very awkward, I start doubting myself and my knowledge, I can't maintain eye contact, use proper body language or even accept criticism without inadvertently getting defensive. </p>
<p>When the person <em>is</em> listening, I freeze up and sort of detach myself (it's really weird), I <em>can</em> hear myself talking AND see them looking (maintaining eye contact therefore listening) but it's like I'm not there. It gets so bad I can feel my heart beating so fast and I start stammering. It almost feels like a panic attack.</p>
<p><strong>WHY does this happen?</strong></p>
<p>P.S: I'm based in the UK</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have stated, this is classic anxiety. What has not been stated is that biologically, the reason for your symptoms is that anxiety is your body activating its fight-or-flight mechanism. When in fight-or-flight, certain parts of your brain and body are shut down to allow other parts to work more efficiently. Your speech center is one of those parts that gets shut down, while your reasoning remains active. If you have overactive anxiety, it can cause a myriad of health issues because your body is in fight-or-flight mode more often than it should be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're trying to put on a show, but you did not do the rehearsals.</p>
<p>When you see people eloquently telling stories, making speeches, arguments, comedy, interviews - all of those things are rehearsed, practiced over and over. </p>
<p>What you need to do is, prepare an advance answer in your off time, so when you do need to converse, youre just copy-pasting information, instead of having an impromptu oral essay.</p>
<p>e.g:
Simon Sinek - Look up his early videos and his current ones. They are all the same, but the latest ones are &quot;smoother&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Social skills isn’t about being factually right. It’s about being emotionally relatable. I suggest you search “charisma on demand” channel on YouTube. </p>
<p>And there’s nothing like practice. </p>
<p>Accept you will fail and then you will eventually succeed. </p>
<p>Been there. Done that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
