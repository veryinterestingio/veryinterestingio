		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have mentioned, salts and sucrose are commonly found in vaccines because they help keep it stable and mimic the blood that the vaccine will be injected into.</p>
<p>As a microbiologist, perhaps the most exciting part of the COVID vaccine is actually the cholesterol and other lipids that are in it. These lipids are like little packages that deliver mRNA into cells. You can put any mRNA into the packages and have a potential vaccine, pending clinical trials, of course. Just like how you wouldn't open an unmarked package, your cells won't take in just any lipid nanoparticle. The special mixes of lipids that Pfizer/BioNtech and Moderna are using have been optimized to be taken into cells and transfer their payload very easily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The various salts are in there to balance the pH (edit: also the isotonic balance as pointed out by another user) as closely as possible with human blood, and according to an article I read, the sucrose is there to somehow provide protection during the freezing process. They also add a tiny bit more saline right before injection in order to further balance the pH.</p>
<p>The lipids, cholesterol, and other fats make up a protective fatty shell (similar to naturally occurring cell walls) protecting the chunks of mRNA. These little protective fat balls dissolve in the body and are expelled or absorbed like any other fatty cells we consume. </p>
<p>Other than the polyethylene glycol (which is a common food additive) and the bits of mRNA, I don't think there's anything on the ingredient list that isn't naturally occurring in our food already.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
