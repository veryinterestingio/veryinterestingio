		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>String theory started as a very reasonable approach to solving problems with the strong nuclear force. At the time there was no theory that described what was going on and so a handful of approaches were being followed. Strings were just one approach. </p>
<p>Eventually things resulted with QCD claiming victory for the strong interaction. However, the research behind strings showed that string theory of closed loops naturally (and effortlessly) spit out a spin 2 massless particle - the graviton - that had none of the problems that destroyed the standard approaches to combining gravity and quantum mechanics. </p>
<p>However, this theory had tons of it's own problems. But at the time, the most difficult unsolved problem in fundamental physics was finding quantum gravity. Many of the most brilliant minds that lived in the 1900s spent decades on this problem and went absolutely nowhere. Dirac, Einstein, Feynman, Wigner, all completely failed this problem. And here it was just a trivial result from string theory. </p>
<p>A lot of people fail to grasp the significance of this. Imagine finding a permanent source of free energy for your cars, power grids, house, electronics etc. But it's only available on Mars. Research would explode trying to figure out how to make Mars inhabitable. </p>
<p>This is basically what happened in string theory. It solved <em>the</em> hard problem of the era but brought about other hard problems. One of those problems was that the theory was broken in 4 dimensions. So some clever guys played around with calculations where the variable D was left unknown instead of setting it to 4. And they found that some problems went away if you just set it to 26.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, to this day string theory still has TONS of unsolved hard problems that prevent it from correctly describing all of physics. 26/11/10 dimensions is just one of the long list of requirements of a universe described by strings at this point. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is rather complicated and with a lot of caveats, special cases and exceptions. First of all, &quot;string theory&quot; is really not a single thing. It's a whole family of models and an ecosystem of related concepts. Further, what gets labeled under the &quot;string theory&quot; umbrella is often a matter of taste or speculation since there is not currently an overarching structure that defines exactly what constitutes string theory. At any rate, taken as a whole it simply isn't true that everything called string theory requires 11 dimensions. </p>
<p>All that said, it's not like there is no reason that the 11 dimensions requirement gets talked about prominently. A big family of related string theory models have a consistency condition which is most straightforwardly satisfied by 10 dimensions of spacetime, i.e. 9 space + 1 time. (If you're wondering, the consistency condition is essentially &quot;does the quantum mechanics of this string always produce sensible probabilities for physical processes?&quot;) This family is often just called the superstring since it is intimately related with supersymmetry, another concept which is avidly studied for various reasons in particle physics (note: supersymmetry is completely theoretical at this point in time but many people will tell you that it is very well-motivated and hints of it appear in experiments we have done, YMMV). At any rate, part of the nature of these superstring models is that the strings interact pretty weakly: they bounce off each, merge and split but don't form bound states like atoms or nuclei. This is not really a conceptual constraint, but instead a mathematical one. Physicists only know how to consistently write down the mathematics of the models in this limit of &quot;weak coupling.&quot;</p>
<p>OK, so the weakly coupled superstring family is only consistent in 10 spacetime dimensions. How do we get 11 dimensions? First, there is a lot of arguments using supersymmetry. Supersymmetry is a pretty rigid structure and it turns out that arguments based on it seem to imply that all the superstring models are not so much models of totally different things as they are models of different phases of the same thing. Further supersymmetry suggests that there is an 11-dimensional phase which has 2 and 5 dimensional membranes instead of strings (the 1D string unrolls from something like a tight cylinder into a 2D sheet). This phase is the strong coupling version of one of the superstring models, but being strongly coupled  is outside the scope of the math that is used to describe the superstrings.</p>
<p>I'm sure this answer is not entirely clear, but to be honest the whole thing is a huge morass and is hard to explain even to theoretical physicists in different areas.</p>
<p>EDIT: I think I went off-topic a bit. To summarize there is a consistency condition in the most interesting string theory models. Satisfying this condition is called anomaly cancellation, and basically comes down to making sure that quantum mechanics of the model is logical, i.e. it doesn't predict insensible things like a process having a negative probability to occur. The superstring solves this condition by being in 10 spacetime dimensions and then supersymmetry tells you that 11 dimensions should also be allowable. Similar consistency conditions actually appear in particle physics models, where the condition limits what are the allowable numbers of particle species. The Standard Model of particle physics would not be mathematically consistent if you willy-nilly added new kinds of particles to it; you would end up with negative probability predictions. This is a powerful constraint on new theories.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To expand on OP's original question - what do the additional dimensions do in string theory? Are they required to tunnel information between standard model particles to express forces or exchange energy that is not visible in the 3 dimensions we can see? Is time one of those 11 dimensions, or is it yet another dimension, if you consider it to be one?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
