And I am just really not understanding how it’s possible. I understand that there is a large fuel leak, but how would ignition even occur accidentally in the ocean? </p>
<p>And then we see boats spraying more water on top. What are they trying to accomplish?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was methane gas, and the ignition was likely intentional. Methane can be very dangerous, it could've built up and then exploded, so they burn it. Once they repaired the pipeline the fire would extinguish itself and did. The oil was in a separate pipe and there was no spill.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some oil wells also produce natural gas (ng) as a byproduct when the area is tapped with a drill.  This NG is highly flammable.   It is either captured for distribution or it is burned off.   I don’t know about this well but they were capturing the NG and sending it through a pipeline.   Perhaps the well was a NG primary purpose well or it was a byproduct of oil capture.   Either way they were piping the NG back to either an onshore or nearshore facility.    The pipe broke and vented the gas.  There was an oil rig very close by.   This occurred during a thunderstorm.   Either the ignition source was from a spark on the oil well close by or lightning from the storm. As the gas continued to bubble up from the pipe it burned.   The gas could have bubbled closer to the oil rig so the spraying of water was just a precaution to keep it away from the oil rig.   The fire was put out by turning off a valve on the pipe and stopping the flow of the NG.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I read earlier, the boats were upwind of the platform and so their aim was to cool the platform, rather than extinguish the fire. The boats had to be careful as to how close they could get, as the fire was creating a lot of bubbles in the water (and this would impact the ability of the boats to float).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Besides what has already  been said, about the ignition source, the means to put it out is to just close the isolation valves. However given the distances involved it takes some time for the gas to stop flowing once you cut the supply.</p>
<p>These isolation valves are remotely operated either pneumatic or hydraulic and will close once a emergency shutdown is initiated or if the air supply/power is cut.</p>
<p>Frequently on many occasions if the pipeline is closed on one end, due to some emergency then it's automatically closed on the other end as well. Although this might not have happened automatically here it will have once emergency was initiated.</p>
<p>The nearest isolation valve might be on the top of the platform or at the other end of the pipeline or even underwater if the pipeline is very long. </p>
<p>The boats are there to mainly intervene in case the wind changes direction and the fire gets routed towards the platform structure not actually put the fire out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ignition was likely intentional. I haven’t seen any specific reporting on this but methane gas is much safer and less negative for the environment once burned. A large build up could have lead to an explosion and even if it was able to diffuse and not explode methane is a much more significant pollutant than water and CO2 which are the byproducts of burning methane. </p>
<p>Not sure what the point of the fire boats was. You could theorize that the agitation of the water kept the fire burning more consistently and thus more controlled. My guess is they got called and wanted to look like they were doing something. The fire was put out by closing a valve. Everything else was just theater.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
