		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have been watching a bunch of videos on different transmission designs recently, and I am stuck on a seemingly straightforward question. Manual transmissions and automatic transmissions are designed very differently, with the latter using planetary gears and torque converter. My question is: why did automatics switch to this completely different gearing mechanism, vs. just automating the shifts in a manual transmission?</p>
<p>I am aware that clutchless and automated manual transmissions exist, but I am not aware of why the conventional automatic transmission design was adopted instead of them. Is this purely historical? (If so, what happened?) If not, what engineering advantages does a conventional automatic offer over an automated manual transmission? (The wikipedia page on automatic and automated manual transmissions did not give me a clear answer.)</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Automatics were designed this way because all the gears are constantly in mesh, and are simple to control hydraulically without any electronics.  </p>
<p>Before the days of servo control, this was required.</p>
<p>An automatic transmission is <em>always</em> under a torque load, which means that you can't use a simple dog clutch + Synchronizer as you can in a manual.  </p>
<p>An Automatic transmission can be shifted while under load, so long as there isn't a locked link to the engine.  This is why an automatic has a torque converter between the transmission and the engine.</p>
<p>So in an automatic there can be a simple change in hydralic pressure to cause the transmission to shift.</p>
<p>In a manual, or automated manual you need to </p>
<ol>
<li>Disengae clutch</li>
<li>Change Gear, and allow the engine/transmission to match RPM via a dog clutch</li>
<li>Engage clutch</li>
</ol>
<p>In a Hydraulic Automatic you need to</p>
<ol>
<li>Change Gear by Locking/unlocking a gear set in the planetary.  As there is no direct mechanical connection between the transmission and the engine the RPM doesn't need to match.  The torque converter allows them to run at separate speeds.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now with Servo Actuators, and Electronic control you can do whatever you like, and the driver is cost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other comments, planetary gearsets have 3 or 4 points of contact between meshed gears to the one point of contact in a conventional gearset. This increased contact area allows a planetary to be made either notably stronger, or more compact.</p>
<p>As a real world comparison,  look at the size of Hondas 6 speed automatic (conventional gears) to their 10 speed automatic (planetary gears). - the 10 speed is smaller and lighter, handles similar torque.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>FYI A lot of modern automatic transmissions don't use planetary gears and torque converters. DSGs (direct shift gearbox) are in a lot of cars (Whole VW concern, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai...). And that system is similar to manuals when it comes to how the mechanics work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's because they wanted to use bands to stop parts of the rotating assembly, which required sun and ring gears inside so the outside shell is large diameter and smooth. It was easier to design and mass produce, and was much like the original Ford Model T transmission which also used a band-brake (but not even in a fluid, yet).</p>
<p>Honda (4-speed) automatics are nothing like that and do not use bands, only multiple plate-clutches inside various gears and on the ends of some shafts.  Much much more like a manual-made-automated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
