		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're right, they don't. It really depends on what  the animal eats and how they've evolved to eat that food.</p>
<p>When you say a human's digestive system is &quot;complex&quot; another way to put it is that we are adapted to eating a wide variety of foods. We have different types of teeth suited for biting flesh, but also for grinding plants. We have a jaw that is fairly strong but not as strong as a gorilla or other apes. We have complex digestive chemicals for breaking down complicated foods like starches but lack the ability digest bones or plant cell walls.</p>
<p>(many) Birds for example don't have the ability grind the seeds they eat, so they have special organs that they fill with rocks that <em>grind</em> the seeds into a paste.</p>
<p>Cats and dogs for example, that eat meat, don't have the proper digestive systems to handle lots of sugars.</p>
<p>But, back to your point, most animals, from flies and ants, up to humans and whales, have a basic &quot;mouth (where food is broken down mechanically) - stomach (where food is broken down chemically) - intestine (where nutrients are absorbed into the body) - butt (where waste is removed)&quot; type system. Those specific terms might be human specific but the general steps are the same.</p>
<p>Each animal does some steps differently though, for example humans excrete dead blood cells with our foodwaste which gives our feces that brown color. Birds combine their poop and pee into a whitish paste. Bulls and cows, that eat lots of grasses and other plant matter, remove their waste in the form of political campaigns.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay so you're right, they don't! Also something nobody else has covered yet is that flies actually don't have all their digestive organs (and functions) in their body.</p>
<p>Flies don't actually have a mouth, no mandibles and no ways to masticate (chew) or rip up their food. So what do they do? When they find something they want to eat they actually vomit a mix of acid and saliva, which digests the food to an extent and breaks it down into a liquid(ish) state, so they can then suck it up through their straw-like proboscis (they have a sort of tiny trunk like an elephant's). </p>
<p>Spiders are similar, they have fangs but they aren't actually in their mouth. They don't have a mouth! The fangs are attached to muscles and parts of their body and are able to move, pinch, inject venom and (in some larger spiders like tarantulas) they can use them to grab, dig and otherwise manipulate things.</p>
<p>However spiders don't have a mouth either, nor do they have digestive organs in the same way as other creatures. Instead their venom also liquifies and begins digesting it and turning it into a nice prey milkshake. And a little bit like flies, they have a soft tubular oesophegus that extends out from the head, behind the fangs, and they use that to suck up their pre-digested meal.</p>
<p>So you are absolutely right so say you don't understand how tiny creatures can have all the digestive organs inside them, because they can't or don't. However nature finds solutions!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I thought flies puke up liquid on to their food that dissolves it so they can drink it down again easily (that's why they like shit, cos it's already broken down). Or at least I think this is reality and not something I learnt from the classic Goldblum movie The Fly üòÇ</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My knowledge only reaches as far as high school biology, which I am taking now, but in our arthropod section, we learned about the anatomy of a grasshopper. (Which i can assume is similar to the common housefly.) </p>
<p>First of all, their anatomy is far different from that of a humans, so you can‚Äôt really compare it. They have what‚Äôs called an ‚Äúopen circulatory system‚Äù in which there are no veins but rather somewhat of a sprinkler system inside that runs blood all over the organs to keep them hydrated. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs probably different for every organism, but in the sense of an insect, their stomachs are large for their body size, but they do not have a complex digestive system such as us, because their diet is not as complex. (I believe:) that their system consists of a mouth, esophagus, stomach, digestive enzymes (kinda like a liver, which is very large relative to our own liver) and an anus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
