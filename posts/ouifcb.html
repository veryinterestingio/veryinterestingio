		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are CRISP-HR Therapeutics, Inc., an early stage biotech company which has developed a dramatically improved CRISPR-based genetic engineering platform, Cas9-HR. The improvements include increased editing efficiency enabling previously unfeasible large edits (1000s of base pairs) at a clinically viable level, in addition to lower cellular toxicity. Our Cas9-HR Platform represents an exciting step for gene editing.</p>
<p>We plan to use our Cas9-HR Platform to develop therapeutics, specifically treatments for genetic diseases that are caused by a diverse number of mutations. Since existing high-efficiency CRISPR technologies are limited to small edits (1-50 base pairs), we believe this is an area where we can make a significant impact.</p>
<p>Answering questions today are the two co-founders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chris Hackley, PhD, CEO: /u/chris-hackley-chr: Chris has 11+ years experience in a variety of biological areas, with particular expertise in protein and genetic engineering. Chris earned his BS in MCD Biology from UCSB, and PhD in protein engineering from NYU.</li>
<li>Richard Gavan, MSc, CTO: /u/richard-gavan-chr: Richard has 8+ years experience consulting in IT for the life sciences industry. Richard earned his BA in Philosophy and Psychology from UCSB, and MSc in Computer Science from Georgia Tech (OMSCS).</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll start answering questions at 19:00 UTC (8pm BST, 3pm EDT, 12pm PDT) on Friday, July 30th. We're looking forward to hearing from you!</p>
<hr />
<p>The guests have finished for today. Thanks for all the great questions!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a molecular biologist, I use CRISPR on the daily. What is it you've done that's different, exactly? You haven't really explained. CRISPR combined with homology-directed repair is very well established at this point. I'm literally using it right now to insert a 2000-base pair gene into primary cells. There are many many mutated/modified cas enzymes with greater efficiency/lower off-targets. What's your USP?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trying to understand, sorry for very basic questions: when you edit 50 vs 1000 bp, what is the mechanism? Is it homologous recombination in both cases, or is there a more direct way? Do you have two guide RNAs targetting the two extreme positions of the stretch of DNA you want to cut out and replace? What limits the distance between these two in classical editing?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
