I just used it as a comparison to get across the meaning of the second part of my question. I was just wondering about the mouth injection and thought I’d ask it here. This was actually the first thing I’ve ever posted on Reddit and I didn’t expect such a huge response. Thank you all.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR: alcohol dries out the mouth which raises the risk of infection in there. Alcohol helps reduce staph on the skin which reduces the risk of infection when breaking the skin.<br />
Finally one I know the answer to! You always hear about the microbiota we have in our guts, but rarely hear about the microbiota on our skin. There is a whole community of microbes on our skin, including staph. But skin does a great job of keeping it out of our bodies, so it’s just a natural part of the community. When you get an injection, you’re obviously creating an opening in the skin, and alcohol does a pretty good job of killing off that bacteria in that area, thus preventing any infection.<br />
Edit: just to clarify, staph isn’t a huge concern in the mouth. If you were to wipe or swish with alcohol in the mouth, it would further dry the tissues in there and that leaves you with a higher risk of infection. Saliva is constantly washing over the mouth and has properties that reduce bacterial growth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
