<p>I’d think that after an earthquake most of the energy would be released, making another one less likely to happen, though that doesn’t seem to be correct as in my case it just got stronger.</p>
<p>I definitely don’t want to die crushed by a building, so yeah. Should I expect another one coming soon?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, there's no &quot;in general&quot; answer to this question. How a fault behaves after an earthquake is specific to that individual fault and is dependent on several variables, such as the shape of the fault, how much the fault slipped, or how much stress was released versus how much was present before rupture.</p>
<p>The friction resisting fault slippage is often not the same at all places along the fault. So the smaller foreshock that you experienced may have been a more weakly bound portion of the fault releasing ahead of the 4.8 main shock.</p>
<p>On the other hand, sometimes foreshocks transfer stress to other parts of the fault, thereby pushing the rest of the fault past the rupture point.</p>
<p>This ambiguity is why individual earthquakes are often reclassified as foreshocks, mainshocks, or aftershocks in the days or weeks after an earthquake sequence, once seismologists have had an opportunity to fully map the events.</p>
<p>To answer your final question: again, unfortunately, seismologists can not predict earthquakes. We would like to, but the physics and geology involved are simply too complicated.</p>
<p>The best advice I can give you is to stay alert, remain calm, and remember your evacuation procedures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The earthquakes you are experiencing in Sicily are related to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/26/mount-etna-magnitude-earthquake-italy-sicily" target="_blank">the volcanic activity at Mount Etna</a>. These could be triggered by movements in the volcano, rather than the movements of tectonic plates like most earthquakes. Just because one M4.8 earthquake happens doesn’t mean that deformation cannot continue and trigger more earthquakes. Please be safe, and check for updates on this situation from the <a href="http://www.ingv.it/en/" target="_blank">INGV</a>.</p>
<p>In both volcanic and tectonic earthquakes, though, one earthquake occurring does not necessarily relieve all stress on a fault. You would need to have thousands of moderate M3-5 earthquakes to relieve the same area as ruptured in a large M7+ earthquake. Foreshocks and aftershocks around a mainshock show that stresses are relieved and transferred in different ways during an earthquake sequence, and parts of faults can also be re-ruptured. It is unfortunately a very difficult problem to untangle and we are still learning a lot about earthquake behavior and their interactions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anyone who gives you a certain answer (definitely yes, or definitely no) is wrong.</p>
<p>There is, sadly, no way to be certain if a single quake has acted to release stress from a fault system, such that it is less likely to quake again, or if a single quake has placed some of the fault under high stress such that it is more likely to quake again, perhaps causing a large quake.  </p>
<p>Knowing which is the case for a particular seismic event would require a higher deal of knowledge about small scale structure and stress maps of the crust than we can possibly know with current methods</p>
<p>In your specific case, a 4.8 in Sicily could either be the largest quake of a series, or the lead up to a larger quake. Both are plausible given the tectonic setting.</p>
<p>Stay safe, learn your local evac procedures and sign up for earthquake alerts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey man, Mexican here, I know what you're going through :(</p>
<p>Think of tectonic plates as a pile of dirty dishes on a conveyor belt. The belt moves and sometimes twist causing the dishes to shuffle into place, sometimes they shuffle underground and we don't even notice, sometimes the shuffling goes all the way to the surface and we feel the damn thing. A smaller one can precede a stronger one yes, it has happened a lot in here, but also sometimes is the other way around. Truth is our current tech doesn't allows us to know when is going to happen or if more follow, hence the importance of being prepared.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the case of sicily, the first one could've been caused by the volcano &quot;preparing&quot; for eruption. Maybe alot of magma got displaced suddenly.</p>
<p>The second earthquake was caused by the actual eruption of the volcano, which releases a tremendous amount of enery which caused the 4.8 mag earthquake.</p>
<p>You probably won't get hit by a bigger earthquake since, from what I've read, most of the eruption process is over.
There may be some small aftershocks due to the earth trying to readjust.</p>
<p>When tectonic plates move over or under eachother multiple big earthquakes of about the same mag can occur due to the violent process that's going on. After that some aftershocks of the earth trying to readjust.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
