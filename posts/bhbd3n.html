		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The skin structure of scalp is basically the same as other parts of the body. However, since it has more lipid glands and sweat glands compared with other parts of the body, it becomes dirty very easily from sweat and sebum. Scalp has a lower barrier function and therefore it has a lower ability to maintain and replenish moisture compared to skin on other parts of the body. Therefore, it is more likely for skin problems to occur on the scalp than on other areas of skin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ooh!! I know this one! There are MORE layers to the skin on your scalp than there are on the skin elsewhere because your scalp skin is not directly attached to the under layers. This is what allows you to pull on your hair and have your scalp look like it’s raising up. Your skin elsewhere also has different concentrations of hair follicles and sebum (oil). It’s like how your eyelid and lip skin is different from the rest of your body’s skin, it serves a different function. The sebum glands on your head help moisturize your head hair and keep them growing healthily. *source, I took a course on hair growth, safety, and hair care techniques to become a certified hair braided in my state! :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The function of the scalp is to protect the skull and brain from injury. As medical students, we learnt the layers of scalp from top to bottom as follows:
S - skin
C - Connective tissue
A- aponeurosis
L - Loose areolar tissue
P - Pericranium</p>
<p>Basically the skin is attached to the aponeurosis with the connective tissue.
Aponeurosis is a sheet of tissue that connects the forehead muscles and the muscles at the back of your head.
Loose areolar tissue allows the skin with the aponeurosis to slide over the skull. </p>
<p>Fun fact - this is why some people can move their whole scalp front to back. </p>
<p>Another fact - native Americans used to “ scalp” the whites to prove to their chiefs their kills! They did this by cutting the scalp off at the level of the loose areolar tissue and the scalp can easily be peeled off in seconds! </p>
<p>We surgeons use the same technique to “scalp” patients to expose the skull for various surgical procedures !!</p>
<p>Sorry for the long post and a bit technical!!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
