		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Deep breathing into your diaphragm stimulates your vagus nerve. Diaphragm breathing is when you breathe deep into your torso, expanding your belly rather than into your chest. The vagus nerve is part of your body's fight or flight response. This is your body's automatic reactions to situations about whether you should feel in danger or at ease.</p>
<p>If your breath is getting stuck, you are likely taking shallow breaths into your chest. This ramps up the body's anxiety as a natural response. You should practice expanding your belly without expanding your chest. Place a hand right below your belly button and place your other hand on your upper chest. Expand your belly and ribcage without expanding your chest. This is a great way to deal with stress, anxiety, and focus problems.</p>
<p><strong>Edit: For anyone struggling with diaphragm breathing.</strong> Shallow breathing is a hard habit to break, compounded by issues like poor posture and poor self awareness. I could teach an hour long course on proper breathing technique and still just scratch the surface. </p>
<p>If you can't figure out how to expand your diaphragm, then try this. We are going to do this backwards from the way many people teach. Exhale first. Standing up, push all of the air out of your lungs by pulling your belly button towards your spine, flattening your stomach. Now rather than pulling air into your lungs, instead just relax all of the muscles you had to use to exhale. Belly expands on its own. Exhale hard, then relax. Exhale, relax.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The body is complicated, but it's got a subconscious gas pedal (SNS nervous system) and a subconscious brake (PSNS nervous system). They're both constantly in use to balance your body's systems, and they respond to your environment without your input. </p>
<p>The SNS gas pedal is responsible for action. When you're in danger, or you need to take in information, or you need to get up and go, the SNS gas pedal makes your heart beat faster, your body sweat, and your eyes dilate. The PSNS brake pedal is responsible for taking care of you when you're at rest: keeping at a rest tempo and digesting your food, among other things. </p>
<p>All this happens subconsciously, without you thinking about it. If you're hyped up or stressed your body might override your breathing and keep you alert. Again, all of this typically happens without your input.</p>
<p>But when you're calm and take in a deep breath, your lungs s-t-r-e-t-c-h, blood goes to your lungs, and the stretch signals both SNS and PSNS systems to &quot;woah!&quot; Then when you exhale a deep breath, the extra blood goes back into your body, which signals for the PSNS brake to engage and &quot;slow down!&quot;. The nerve used for this signal is the vagus nerve - named because it's a wanderer all around the body - including to your heart and your gut.  When stimulated by your long exhale, your vagus nerve makes your body relax, makes your heart rate slow down, and makes your gut feel <em>good</em> and satisfied and ready to digest your food.</p>
<p>TL;DR - Breathing deep is a sign through your subconscious PSNS that you're safe and it's time to chill, your gut is happy, and it's time to digest food.</p>
