		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but not very quickly.</p>
<p>Quick googling suggests that a flashlight with 2 1.5V AA batteries uses about 1 A of current, so that would make for 3 W of power. Some of this is lost as heat, but lets say it's 50% efficient and we're shining 1.5 W worth of light out the end of the flashlight.</p>
<p>So in 1 second we're emitting light with a total energy of 1.5 J. The momentum carried by this light is found by the equation p = E / c (momentum equals energy divided by speed of light). So that would be 1.5 / 300,000,000 = 0.000000005 kg m / s.</p>
<p>Because of conservation of momentum, that's the amount transferred to whatever object the flashlight is attached to. For the sake of argument, lets say that it's just the flashlight flying away, with nothing else attached to it. Flashlights typically weigh somewhere below a kg for basic models. Lets say 0.5 kg.</p>
<p>That would mean that such a flashlight would gain 0.00000001 m / s in speed every second. Or 0.000864 m / s every day. Or 0.32 m / s after a year of non-stop operation. Except that the batteries won't last that long.</p>
<p>There are a number of rough assumptions in here (power, efficiency and weight of the flashlight) that may be inaccurate. However, it should be clear that even if these estimates are somewhat off, the conclusion remains the same: Acceleration using a flashlight is extremely small.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>One proposed method of propulsion in space is the &quot;solar sail&quot;. It's basically a giant mirror. Light hits the mirror and transfers some energy, pushing the mirror (and whatever it's attached to) forward. In this way, you could design a space ship with a giant mirror sail that doesn't use fuel!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's known as the photon rocket. And you need 300 megawatts to get one Newton of thrust.</p>
<p>If the power source is on board, then even though a photon rocket spaceship isn't expelling reaction mass, it's still limited by its fuel supply. The maximum practical speed is therefore well under 1% of light speed with fusion power. Better performance would be achieved with a design that does expel reaction mass, especially if you can expel the spent fusion fuel.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. </p>
<p>You can calculate the thrust produced by a light source, with the general thrust equation.</p>
<p>Force is change of momentum divided by change of time:</p>
<p><em>F = dp/dt</em></p>
<p>Each photon has momentum. For any photon, it's momentum is its energy divided by speed of light:</p>
<p><em>p = E/c</em></p>
<p>Usually we would continue this by substituting E = hf and then simplifying to the more common form <em>p = h/Î»</em>, but in this case we actually don't need that.</p>
<p>We can just say that for many photons, their combined momentum is the sum of their energies divided by c.</p>
<p>So, we can turn this into a differential form and say that </p>
<p><em>dp = dE/c</em></p>
<p>Now if we substitute this into the thrust equation, we get</p>
<p><em>F = dE/dt 1/c</em></p>
<p>...and since <em>dE/dt</em> is the definition of <em>power</em> (energy consumed in certain time), that's our formula for the thrust produced by light:</p>
<p><em>F = P / c</em></p>
<p>where <em>P</em> is the radiative power of the light source in watts, and <em>c</em> is speed of light.</p>
<p>This is, actually, the most <em>efficient</em> rocket thruster that can possibly exist, since the ejection velocity of the &quot;exhaust&quot; is the speed of light. That gives it the highest possible specific impulse, and since the amount of propellant consumed is truly minuscule, it could in theory make it possible to be used for propulsion over very long times and distances. However, in order to achieve actually meaningful thrust would require a truly massive light source.</p>
<p>In reverse, to produce a meager one Newton of thrust you would need a light source with the radiative power of</p>
<p><em>P = 1 N</em> * <em>c</em> = 299 792 458 W, or almost 300 MW.</p>
<p>Since producing this kind of power for an extended period of time would require quite a bulky nuclear reactor, just to produce 1 Newton of force, the acceleration would be very small and probaly not practical in the context of human spaceflight. In fact it would probably be considered as a weapon of mass destruction rather than a propulsive system. Though, as we know from the Man-Kzin wars, &quot;a reaction drive's efficiency as a weapon is in direct proportion to its efficiency as a drive.&quot;</p>
<p>However! This thrust produced by light actually does have an effect on the orbits of asteroids, depending on whether they rotate prograde or retrograde relative to their orbit. The way it works is, the Sun heats up the side of the asteroid facing towards it. As the asteroid rotates, the heated side will rotate one way or the other, and radiate the heat away from the asteroid's surface.</p>
<p>If the asteroid rotates so that the heated side points &quot;forwards&quot;, or prograde, relative to its orbit, then the thermal radiation from the heat will produce a net thrust that slows the asteroid down.</p>
<p>If it rotates the other way, so that the heated side points &quot;backwards&quot;, or retrograde, then the effect is opposite and the asteroid is accelerated into higher orbit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the radiation pressure from the Sun is pushing the asteroid outward, applying a radial force that depends on things like the asteroid's albedo (brightness).</p>
<p>These forces are very small, but space is big and old, and over a long time they start making a difference. Along with gravitational perturbations from planets and other asteroids, these small forces are one of the major sources of anomalies in asteroid orbits. This is why it's difficult to predict their orbits for extended periods of time, and they have to be tracked by radar or other observations to update their orbits. Larger asteroids typically have more stable orbits, while the small ones tend to drift more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other people have provided the math, I would like to provide some intuition.</p>
<p>Reaction engines (like jet or rocket engines) expel <em>reaction mass</em> in one direction. By Newton's third law, the momentum gained by the engine is opposite to the momentum gained by the reaction mass.</p>
<p>There are two types of efficiency to be considered: mass efficiency and energetic efficiency. Mass efficiency is momentum gained per kg of expelled mass. Energetic efficiency is the momentum gained per Joule expended energy. There is always a trade off between the two.</p>
<p>Imagine you are sitting on an office chair, you push yourself against a shopping cart with potatoes. You and the shopping cart get a comparable speed. It doesn't cost you much energy. High energetic efficiency. However, the cart is heavy, low mass efficiency.</p>
<p>Imagine you are sitting on a chair and you throw a basketball. You will be pushed back slightly, but not as much as when you used the shopping cart. The mass efficiency is higher, but the energetic efficiency is lower.</p>
<p>If you push against very little mass, you need more energy to get the same acceleration! This is why commercial planes don't use true <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbojet" target="_blank">turbojets</a> but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbofan" target="_blank">turbofans</a>, which accelerate more air and have a higher energy efficiency.</p>
<p>For planes, energy efficiency is more important than mass efficiency, since the air is all around us. For rockets, this not necessarily true, since they can get energy from the sun, but mass must be carried on board and is limited. This is why some probes use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_thruster" target="_blank">ion thrusters</a>, which electrically accelerate Xenon ions. They use very little mass and therefore need smaller rockets to be launched, however, they use very large amounts of energy for a small amount of acceleration. Fortunately they have solar panels and lots of time.</p>
<p>But, if you take this to the extreme, photons are massless. The mass efficiency would be infinite. But the amount of energy it requires to accelerate yourself using photons is so large that by E=MC^2 you would need a lot of mass to generate that amount of energy in the first place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
