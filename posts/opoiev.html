		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, back in caveman days, sugar and fat and salt were really rare. Sugar and fat were full of energy that would help us survive famines. Salt helps regulate our body's fluids. So we evolved to find them delicious, to encourage people to work hard to find those rare treats. </p>
<p>It's only been relatively recently that getting too much fat, salt and sugar has been possible, where we can eat so much of them that we negatively impact our health. But, our bodies are still in caveman mode going &quot;We need to store as much fat as we can to survive an ice age!&quot; Evolution takes thousands of years, and so our bodies still act they way they did when we were cavemen hunting mammoths to survive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>The things your body wants are determined by evolution.</li>
<li>Evolution is very very slow.</li>
<li>Result: Everything about your body and mind are honed by millions of years of evolution....to be well suited for the conditions that existed like 50,000+ years ago.</li>
</ol>
<p>There's the problem. Up until very VERY recently evolution-wise, food was always scarce, or at least <em>unpredictable.</em> Even more rare was high calorie food like fats and sugars. Therefore having the trait &quot;<em>if you engounter high-cal food, eat as much as physically possible</em>&quot; was overall a very good, advantageous trait to have. Individuals with this trait would have been more likely to survive a drought, a famine, the winter cold, getting sick, being wounded, etc, many of the various things that were killing humans. It only becomes problematic if you encounter so much food (and spend so little energy day-to-day) that you become obese. But for our hunter-gatherer ancestors, there just wasn't enough high-cal food for this to be a problem. So humans ended up with this trait, because it was over all good for us. We even got a brain program that gives us a dopamine hit when we eat fats and sugars!<br />
Fast forward to the last \~100 years and now fatty sugary foods are everywhere, available very easily all the time for cheap, often cheaper than healthier foods. This is not at all the environment our food-behaviours were designed for. The cravings that kept our ancestors alive for literally millenia are now NOT self serving. Evolution simply hasn't had enough time to re-write the program we're all running that says &quot;see fat = eat!&quot;.  </p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: We evolved to crave calories because food was unpredictable. Now food is cheap and easy so it's backfiring. 100 years of supermarket junkfood is NOTHING vs how long we'd been adapting, and evolution is SLOW.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because unhealthy food is good for you - it stops you starving to death, and starving to death tends to be counterproductive. The trouble with unhealthy food though is that because we only really had an abundance of calories starting in the last sort of 50-100 years, natural selection was unable to evolve an upper limit. It gave us a desire to seek out the food that will stop us dying, but no off switch once that desire is appropriately sated except for sheer physical stomach space. </p>
<p>&quot;Unhealthy&quot; and &quot;healthy&quot; food is a bit of a misnomer. These words only exist in the context of a post-scarcity society where overeating is a far bigger risk than undereating, and the only people at risk of starving to death are people everyone collectively agreed they didn't care about, like the homeless and foreigners. What's actually unhealthy is malnutrition, which is getting either too many <em>or too few</em> calories and other macronutrients. There's no such thing as unhealthy types of food, only unhealthy quantities of food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because we evolved in environments where the healthy stuff was easy to get hold of. The fats and sugars which provided the essential energy were harder to come by, so we're programmed to want them even if we're otherwise pretty satiated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans have been around for a long period time, dieting is a relatively new phenomenon. Traditionally when humans first came to be, they had to hunt and forage for food themselves  and thus nutrition came less frequently. As a result they would make the best of any opportunity because they knew there may not be another one. Food abundance and high sugar foods are a fairly modern concept and are a result of technological and societal advancements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
