		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It happens for the same reason why you can sit in the open bed of a pickup truck and not get blasted in the face by wind - the air doesn't flow <em>exactly</em> over the top of the truck, which creates a pocket of <a href="https://www.darcorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/H_Spoiler.jpg" target="_blank">still air</a>. </p>
<p>The same thing happens to fan blades as they cut through the air - there's a tiny static bubble of relatively still air that &quot;sticks&quot; to the back of the blade, which the fast-moving air flows <em>around</em>. In this pocket of still air, it's easy for dust to accumulate - <em>some</em> of that fast-moving air does fall into the pocket and swirl around a bit, which offers a chance for the dust to get stuck on the blade (or other dust particles). Since the fan is coming into so much air, it has more chances to come in contact with dust, so it gets dusty very fast.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We think of dust as falling like rain, gently down on everything, but dust (or surfaces) can often carry different electrostatic charges, or just be greasy/sticky/oddly shaped, and the fan blades are actually interacting with much more air than they would be if turned off.  So every time the blades pass by new air, the dust particles in it get a chance to stick to the blade, either because of charge or mechanical adhesion.  As the dust builds up into a layer, it gets better at attracting <em>more</em> dust because the surface is rougher and builds up more charge, and can grab more dust out of the air.  If you think about it, the fan is really filtering the contaminants out of the air, so just be glad you didn't breath all that crap you have to wipe off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone's talking about a 'thin layer' of unmoving air without really explaining why - what's going on is that air has friction.</p>
<p>It's like a bunch of mud sliding down a hill - the bottom of the mud will stick to the hill, so that overall you have kind of a rolling tread motion going on.  At the very bottom of the mud, the mud and the hill are basically not moving relative to each other. This is different from what would happen if it was sliding down a hill made of ice.</p>
<p>Well the fan blade is like the hill, and the air going by can't move at full speed right against its surface. There's a gradient of relative motion, and that gradient approaches zero as you get right up against the fan. </p>
<p>So it's not really just a single mysterious layer of unmoving air, but a basic fact about how air can move at all; it's a bit sticky and will pour around things instead of just sliding past at full speed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>you can treat a fan blade as a moving airfoil, which is saying it can be treated as a wing. As it moves through the air, a layer, or pocket, of air collects on the surface called the boundary layer. As the blade moves through the air, air(containing dust gets trapped on this boundary layer and cannot escape until the fan stops. This is there the dust rests. It is likely that the dust that moves across the fan blade in this turbulent region develops a static charge and sticks to the blade through electrostatic force.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>when you have air flowing relative to a surface, there is what is known as a &quot;no-slip boundary condition&quot; where there exists a thin layer of air against the blades that is not moving relative to the blades. as the dust is so light that it pretty much moves within the air, and the air is still relative to the blade at the boundary layer, it can settle on the fan blade as though it were sitting still.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
