		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of folks are defining cognitive dissonance here in reference to actions, which isnâ€™t wrong per se, but it is incomplete. Cognitive dissonance can also be understood as the discomfort created by believing two competing contradictory ideas at once. For instance, believing the creation story in the Bible but also believing in evolution. </p>
<p>Confirmation bias is the preference to ignore evidence that contradicts your held beliefs in favor of evidence that supports your beliefs. For instance, disregarding evidence of evolution and favoring evidence that confirms your belief in the creation story in the Bible. In a way, confirmation bias is a way of avoiding cognitive dissonance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're not all that similar. Cognitive dissonance is where thinking and doing are two seperate things. Imagine a serial killer believing killing is wrong.</p>
<p>Confirmation bias is where a outcome is expected (or wanted) so badly it shifts results. For example, imagine you believe all cheese is yellow, so you then notice all mcdonald's burgers use yellow cheese and therefore you use that as evidence that all cheese is yellow</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cognitive dissonance is when your established belief system, or how you view the world is challenged by conflictng beliefs that you've determined to be true. For example, you might believe in the Christian creation story of the universe, but you have also come to believe in evolution. This causes internal stress and conflict.
Confirmational bias is exactly what it states; you search for evidence that confirms your biased beliefs and disregard any evidence that contradicts those beliefs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cognitive Dissonance occurs when an existing belief or behavior is challenged with new information that contradicts that belief or behavior, or shows it is considered &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;evil&quot;. </p>
<p>You then have these contradictory pieces of information in your head (which is the cognitive dissonance) and you have to resolve it somehow because it feels mentally uncomfortable not to deal with it.</p>
<p>The most difficult way to resolve is the changing the belief or behavior. It's easier to resolve by ignoring/attacking the new information, or otherwise explaining a way that it doesn't apply to you, or you'll change &quot;later/eventually&quot;, just not right now.</p>
<p>Confirmation bias is the natural tendency to look for evidence that supports a way we already think, and not search for (or discount) evidence that does not support it or contradicts it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cognitive dissonance is when your thoughts and beliefs are inconsistent with your actions or directly contradict them. For example, someone smoking despite believing it's bad for them.</p>
<p>Confirmation bias is coming to the conclusion something is true based on new evidence without taking into account how it would be true. An example would be someone believing left-handed people are more creative than right-handed ones and only focuses on cases of creative lefties.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
