<li>
<p>Continue making you tired and sleepy to force you to rest.</p>
</li>
<li>Give you a burst of adrenaline to get out of your situation so you can safely rest.</li>
</ol>
<p>It turns out that people with bodies that activate #1 tended to not survive dangerous situations and spread those traits to their offspring compared to your ancestors who have bodies that activate #2.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's 2 main hormones controlling how sleepy you feel- one of them just builds up over time and resets when you've got enough sleep, and the other goes up and down based on the time of day. </p>
<p>So after being awake for a long time, there will be a time late at night where both hormones are at a high and you're very sleepy. But after this, early in the morning, while one hormone keeps building up the one based on the clock begins to fade again. So you'll have comparatively more energy than before. </p>
<p>There's other factors at play as well but this is one mechanism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You body has lots of chemicals that help you function. Sometimes they help you sleep, or sometimes they make you feel sad. There are chemicals that give you energy, and sometimes when you're awake too long, you can let the sleepy chemicals stop working, and you're left with energy ones instead. It's not healthy always, but sometimes it helpful when you need it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
