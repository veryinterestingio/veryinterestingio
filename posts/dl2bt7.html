		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add, an axe may be useful in situations that a firefighter may be found it, but not a swat team. A ram wouldn’t be very useful for a firefighter for anything except breaching doors. An axe could be used to also clear debris, or put a hole in a wall, or floor, or it may be used as a lever to clear debris even.  Also to note, a firefighters axe is commonly paired with a halligan tool, a long sturdy prying bar. The axe is just a more well rounded tool for what the firefighter is trying to accomplish.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rams only break the locks on doors. They cannot be used to clear debris or to cut through walls the way that an ax can. You also have the fact that opening a sudden breach can create a major backdraft and hurt or kill the firefighter. Breaching the door more slowly actually reduces this chance and thus increases safety.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>SWAT uses rams to punch a door open quickly.  It's not always the right tool for the job, but it's the most frequently used.  Jamb spreaders, hooligan tools, breaching rounds, and explosives can be used as well.  The difference is that many SWAT operations are planned in advance, and we know exactly what to use.  If it's a dangerous, no-knock thing, we have to make entry quickly for a safe run.  There's usually a designated breacher, so he carries a heavy ram that's ditched after use.  </p>
<p>Firefighters are in a different situation, and a fire axe covers a lot of ground for them.  They don't need to worry about a reactionary gap (being super-fast), so they have time to chop through a door, roof, wall, window, or whatever to enter, exit, or vent a space.  The axe covers a LOT of tasks with a small weight load in addition to all the crap a firefighter is already carrying.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
