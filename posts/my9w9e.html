		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The term usually used for such non-simplistic geometry is 'organic'</p>
<p>The reason is how countries were formed or originated. In very simplistic terms, more often than not people of a village or area came under control of a ruling party/administration, or joined together to form a single entity. These villages and areas are inhabited based on needs of the people, so they may have some mining going on in the nearby hills and mountains, or some fresh water like river and lakes, or farmland etc. There may also be geological features such as aforementioned rivers and mountain ranges that limit the people</p>
<p>So when they become united, these resources and features demarcate the boundaries, creating these organic &quot;zigzag&quot; boundaries, instead of neat geometrically pleasing straight lines - nature does not work on a geometric grid</p>
<p>However, you may still find some countries with straight line boundaries. And almost all of them have them because in their colonial past, the colonial powers decided not to do their homework properly and simply drew lines on a map to carve out territories between themselves. Many of these borders are an issue to this day</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes its based on geographic features, such as rivers or Mountain ranges.</p>
<p>Other times it's based on the English, French, and Spanish empires deciding where a good boundary for thier respective territory would be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking boundaries are set either by politics or by natural features. The boarder might Zig zag around cities claimed by different people or Nations. It also can Zig Zag to fit natural features like rivers or mountains which don't often take logical shapes on the map. One exception is the border between Canada and America which is straight except around natural features like the great lakes and some complex treaty agreements. As if Canadians and Americans had a lot to say about certain parts of the border but not a whole lot about the rest of it, they agreed to use the 49th parallel to draw the large part of the boarder. The 49th parallel, the latitude line 49 degrees above the equator, called parallel because it runs alongside the equator in the same direction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
