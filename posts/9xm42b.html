		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the main components of exhaust is water. As the exhaust cools the water vapor becomes visible. For the first bit of driving the exhaust system is cold and this point happens inside the exhaust. After the vehicle warms up this point happens outside of the car and the effect is minimized.</p>
<p>In addition water usually accumulates in the exhaust and it takes a while to &quot;dry out&quot; the muffler and tailpipe. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This condensation, or lack of it, is why my first brand new car never had its exhaust changed for the whole 450,000 odd kilometres that it ran for. As I travelled by far mostly country kilometres, the exhaust system was hot for the most of the time. I never really understood this till an engineer friend was amazed the exhaust was the original the car came with. So yeah, if you want your exhaust to last as long as possible, make sure it gets heated all the way up and that will dry the water out, reducing the chance of rust. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add another answer besides water car engines are combustion based meaning they work far better when they are hot. In the winter when you start your car it is at the lowest possible efficiency it will ever operate at and as such you are burning more fuel and releasing more fumes per second compared to a few minutes later when the engine has warmed up a bit.</p>
<p>This is the reason why the UK government spent a lot of money on PSAs asking people to not use their cars for short trips in the winter as you're basically generating a seriously unnecessary amount of pollution in the first few minutes of each journey.</p>
<p>EDIT: First paper I found showing I'm right, can't be bothered to spend any more time on this but there are more recent news reports saying the same thing so I'm safe. Feel free to spend more time researching it if you so want.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water is a byproduct of combustion. Typically,  as a water vapor. </p>
<p>That water gets exhausted with other gases and is forced down the exhaust system by the velocity of the engine’s piston. </p>
<p>Sometimes, you see the water exiting the exhaust in liquid form (you can see it dripping from the tail pipe). When this happens, the conditions are just right that the water vapor condenses on the cool exhaust pipe. </p>
<p>As the vehicle warms up, the temperature of the exhaust system also heats up. When the temperature of the exhaust goes above the dew point temperature, that water vapor no longer condenses in the exhaust pipe. Instead, it continues out and condenses with the cool outside air. This vapor condensation is the steam that you see coming from the exhaust (some think it’s smoke, but it likely is not on well maintained vehicles). </p>
<p>Temperature conditions keep rising, and the discharged vapor gets even hotter. At this point, it’s too hot to immediately condense with the cool air. Instead, it exits the exhaust and quickly disperses into the outside air. It’s so hot that the air rises and expands much more quickly. It eventually condenses with the air, but you don’t see it because it’s not happening as rapidly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
