<p>Peanut butter is a bunch of tiny solids suspended in oil, for example. Things like toothpaste are solids suspended in liquid too. Syrup is a bunch of suger dissolved in water, so technically a liquid. </p>
<p>The other guy is probably correct about the word being &quot;colloid&quot;, but that's not an actual phase of matter. The truth is that there is no real state of matter between solid and liquid, there's just a mixture of things that are either solid or liquid, but in the same space.</p>
<p>People might call the &quot;colloids&quot;, but in reality they are just very thick liquids or very dense suspensions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Peanut butter is a homogeneous mixture of immiscible liquids (water in fat) and is therefore an <em>emulsion</em> or a type of colloid. Colloids are classified by the phases of the substances involved and includes sols (solid in a liquid), emulsions (liquid in another liquid), aerosols (liquid or solid in a gas), or foams (gas in a liquid or solid).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Thick syrups are <em>non-Newtonian liquids</em> that exhibit <em>shear thinning</em> behavior. Syrups are mixtures of water, sugars, minerals, and various organic compounds and their internal structure consists of polymer chains of macro-molecules. Shear stresses align or break down these molecules, thereby decreasing the liquid's resistance to flow. This is known as <em>shear thinning</em> or <em>Pseudo-plastic</em> behavior and manifests as a decrease in viscosity with increasing shear rate. Some other examples of shear thinning liquids are Ketchup and Honey.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The other type of non-Newtonian behavior occurs when flow stresses cause the liquid's molecules or suspended particles to tangle up chaotically or to clump together (flocculation). The resulting increase in viscosity with shear rate is known as <em>shear thickening</em> or <em>Dilatant</em> behavior. A popular example is Oobleck (a mixture of corn starch and water). </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The viscosity of Newtonian liquids does not change with respect to shear rate. Water and (molten) pure metals are Newtonian liquids.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Note: the <em>plastic</em> in <em>Pseudo-plastic</em> refers to plastic  or irreversible deformation, not the stuff Legos are made out of</p>
<p>Fun Fact: The German adjective for shear thinning is &quot;strukturviskos&quot; or structurally viscous</p>
<p>Source: I wrote my PhD dissertation on the viscous behavior of molten metals</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> pedantically, both are liquids. Peanut butter just happens to be multiple liquids.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To continue, a colloid does not have to be gelatinous. Homogeneous milk is a colloid. A substance with particles suspended within that do not settle out over time is a colloid (yes, particle size does matter).
You can test if a substance is a colloid or not by using a flashlight or laser pointer.
When you shine the light through the side of a glass of water, you can’t see the beam of light. If you shine the light through the side of a colloid, the particles reflect the light all around and you can see the beam of light in the substance. This is known as the Tyndall effect.
Try it! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Beyond being a colloid, peanut butter is what’s known as a <em>yield stress fluid</em>. This essentially means that it is in both states — a solid until a critical stress is applied, at which point it flows like a fluid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
