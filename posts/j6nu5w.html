To the best of my knowledge this means that after vaccination the immune system learns to defeat this adonovirus and because of the modification also learns to render the spikes on the corona virus useless. Of course I'm using layman terms here.</p>
<p>If someone is vaccinated with this vaccine and a different virus comes along, can this platform still be used for this new virus?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually the Adenovirus 26 is just the carrying 'vehicle', like a syringe, to inject its engineered cargo (the DNA encoding the spike protein).</p>
<p>The reason adenovirus is used is because it was discovered way back in 1953, later discovered to cause tumor (cancers) in mice. When used as a delivery vehicle though, it has been shown to be safe (although the field of gene therapy was set back a decade or so when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Gelsinger" target="_blank">Jesse Gelsinger died</a>in a U Penn clinical trial, and yes, they used an adenoviral vector).</p>
<p>The answer to your question 'can this platform be used' is yes it absolutely can - the technology can be 're-used' with simply new DNA 'cargo' to the new virus target.</p>
<p>Looking up the <a href="https://www.raps.org/news-and-articles/news-articles/2020/3/covid-19-vaccine-tracker" target="_blank">47 vaccines using this tracking tool</a>, CanSino's (China's) leading vaccine is based on Adenovirus 5, and Oxford's / AstraZeneca's vaccine is based on a chimpanzee adenovirus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s a legitimate concern, but it may not be an overwhelming problem.  I don’t know of a study that’s specifically looked at this, and that’s what will be needed. </p>
<p>The reason it may not be overwhelming is because the vaccines are non-replicating vectors that only express the gene for the vaccine antigen. So you input the complete virus, with its surface antigens, but only at a low level. The adenovirus enters cells, and starts producing vaccine antigen (driving an immune response, hopefully) but does not make any more of its own surface antigens. So the only driver of immunity is the low level of input virion. </p>
<p>Is that enough to cause an immune response? Probably yes, but without an inflammatory driver at the same time you’d tentatively predict that the immunity to the adenovirus antigens would be low and short-lived. </p>
<p>But this is theory, and vaccines don’t depend on theory.  Everything about vaccines is empirical, measured and tested. So until there’s a study looking at whether repeated use of ad26 vaccines is effective, we won’t know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are new vaccines being developed (for Covid-19 for example) using existing vaccine platforms. As u/yayork said, there are no studies specifically looking at this, but it doesn't really stop pharma companies trying to do it. In the end, the vaccines safety and efficacy has to be proved in the clinical trials so we'll see if the approach is viable or not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
