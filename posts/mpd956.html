Our provincial government has mandated that we push back booster shots well beyond the recommended period, in this case, it's four months from twenty-one days for Pfizer. He said that the manufacturer has set twenty-one days for a reason, so how effective is the booster after four months. His position is that it's pointless to even get it if the booster shot is worthless after even twenty-two days.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You gotta realize that the &quot;manufacturer recommended&quot; period is literally the <strong>only</strong> one they tested to get the vaccine approved. There is no evidence its the optimal one, in fact its very unlikely to be as the optimal period is much longer for practically all vaccines.</p>
<p>Why did they pick 21 days? They had to start somewhere, they were in a hurry to get the vaccine approved and 21 days was about the shortest period that was worth trying.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a difference between being &quot;worthless&quot; and gradually becoming less effective over time. Some places have decided more people and less (but still very high) potency is better than less people vaccinated at an extra high potency. </p>
<p>The 3 week date isn't necessarily set because it starts to lose potency at that point, but more due to a limitation of studies since they haven't been around that long. As we get more information over a longer period of time they'll determine if the current recommendation is necessary or if a longer wait is still acceptable. </p>
<p>With the Pfizer vaccine they're trying to decide if a second dose is even necessary in some cases, as people that have already had covid produced 6x more antibodies after the first dose than someone that hasn't had covid</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's very likely the vaccine second does would be effective if administered quite a long time after the minimum period.  With other vaccines, boosters are often administered months or even years apart and they work fine.  The 21 days is the time they actually tested because they had to pick some time period to test, getting vaccine testing complete quickly was important, and there's a minimum spacing at which vaccines and boosters have to be administered or the response to the original vaccine won't be finished by the time the booster comes along.  Their preliminary testing indicated 21 days was long enough, so they went with that and it worked.   The 21 days is more of a minimum...try to cut it shorter than that and the booster won't work as well, but going longer is less likely to be a problem.  </p>
<p>There's no data on this for Pfizer, but one study with Oxford-Astrozenica showed an <em>increased</em> level of immunity for those who waited 3 months vs 6 weeks.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/02/delaying-2nd-astrazeneca-covid-shot-may-boost-efficacy" target="_blank">https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/02/delaying-2nd-astrazeneca-covid-shot-may-boost-efficacy</a></p>
<p>However, Pfizer is so good to start with there's not exactly a lot of room for improvement.   The main downside of delaying a shot isn't that the second shot won't work just as well, the main downside is that you have a longer wait before getting the benefit of the second shot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3odScka55A" target="_blank">video</a> floating around that brings up the point of &quot;what is vaccine efficacy&quot; - and it turns out that question is pretty important to answering your question.  </p>
<p>We boil the studies that were done down to a single numerical percent, i.e. the two-dose vaccine on a 21-day schedule is 95% effective at stopping a corona virus infection.  This often gets compared to the Johnson and Johnson one-dose vaccine, which has something like a 66% efficacy rate. </p>
<p>That sounds a lot worse than the two-dose, although <em>much</em> better than &quot;pointless&quot; as your uncle would suggest.  But the bar here is &quot;tests positive for coronavirus.&quot;  Corona virus can have an affect anywhere from &quot;asymptomatic carrier&quot; to &quot;death&quot; and this number doesn't tell us anything about how bad the cases are.  So what happens to those efficacy rates if look at the broader range of symptoms.  What about how many people die?  Or are hospitalized?  Is the one-dose vaccine better, or worse, than it's 66% efficacy rate at preventing these serious cases?</p>
<p>Well, in those initial studies, all the vaccines - two dose and one dose alike - were <em>100% effective</em> at stopping hospitalizations.  Zero people in the test groups had severe, life-threatening cases of covid 19.</p>
<p>Now, the study groups weren't huge; and actual effectiveness is likely to be a bit less than 100%.</p>
<p>But that should give you an idea of how effective the single dose of vaccine, without the booster, will be:  it should be almost certain to prevent you from being killed or hospitalized by corona.  You might still be at risk of getting a mild case.  That sounds a lot better than &quot;pointless&quot; to me.</p>
<p>You're talking about getting one shot of the two-dose vaccine, and we don't have big studies on that yet.  But I've heard initial evidence is that its efficacy is similar to the one-dose J&amp;J vaccine, so you can probably expect similar results.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is an excellent question, but unfortunately thereâ€™s a lack of evidence to provide a definitive answer in either direction.  While some who support the notion of waiting 4 months between doses often cite that the UK is waiting 12 weeks between AstraZeneca doses, they often fail to note that 12 weeks is within the manufacturerâ€™s recommendation for that particular vaccine.  Other clues (that cite little in the way of primary sources) indicate that the Pfizer dose loses significant efficacy after 5-6 week after the first dose for some of our vulnerable groups (see link below).  Unfortunately there is very little detailed information available on this question.</p>
