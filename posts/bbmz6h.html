Timekeeping, on the other hand, with accuracy beyond &quot;mid day&quot; or &quot;late afternoon&quot; only got serious with the advent of precision clocks, almost all of which were developed and spread from Europe during exploration. Since everyone was trying to steal from/copy/improve on clocks for several reasons, not least of which was accurate sailing in the middle of the ocean, timekeeping was sort of easy to standardize on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has everything to do with European colonialism. </p>
<p>Many cultures outside of europe had a variety of ways to measure time, and even within Europe there were difference, but these mellowed out eventually. However, upon basically conquering and spreading their influence around the world, the European countries also imposed their time/calendar and such on the rest of the world. It also helps that Europeans were pretty good at developing things like accurate clocks and such that made their method of time telling a good and widely available and easy to use standard.</p>
<p>If Europe hadn't spread its influence over the rest of the world, we may not have a universal time, calender or who knows-- maybe we would all be using the earlier chinese version(s) where the day was divided up into 100 14-minute 24 second segments</p>
<p>For measurements, there were again a lot of systems in use, however, eventually the metric system had gained much popularity and was often used in addition to local systems, or eventually completely replaced them.  As metric was used heavily in trade, it made sense or many nations to move over to it, and many did.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As for time, there have been other suggestions but they didn’t fly. See <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatch_Internet_Time?wprov=sfti1" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatch_Internet_Time?wprov=sfti1</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
