		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The strong and weak force only act over very short distances, but within those distances, they're much stronger than gravity.</p>
<p>To get a feel for scales, we can first look at the comparison between gravity and the electromagnetic force.</p>
<p>Take a proton and an antiproton. Classically, they feel a gravitational force F<em><em>g</em></em> = GM^(2)/r^(2), and a Coulomb force of F<em><em>c</em></em> = ke^(2)/r^(2), where e is the proton charge and M is the proton mass.</p>
<p>The ratio of these forces is F<em><em>c</em></em>/F<em><em>g</em></em> = ke^(2)/(GM^(2)). Note that this ratio is independent of the distance between the particles, and its value is about 10^(36). So the Coulomb force is 36 orders of magnitude stronger than gravity.</p>
<p>Now let's compare the Coulomb force between the proton and antiproton to the strong force, with some caveats. For gravity and the Coulomb force, I used classical equations to get an estimate for the difference in strength. But the strong and weak forces aren't easily expressed in classical physics. So instead, I'll compare binding energies of hadronic systems bound by the Coulomb force, and bound by the residual strong force. (You could do the same with quarkonia and hadrons to get a sense for the strong forces between quarks rather than the residual strong forces between hadrons.)</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protonium" target="_blank">Protonium</a> is a proton bound to an antiproton by their attractive Coulomb force. It's kind of like a very exotic hydrogen atom where you replace the electron by an antiproton. The binding energy of this system is about 0.75 keV.</p>
<p>Now let's consider an analogous system bound by the residual strong force instead: the deuteron. The deuteron is a nucleus of hydrogen-2, a proton bound to a neutron. The binding energy of this system is 2.22 MeV.</p>
<p>You could argue that it's not really a fair comparison, because the length scales for these systems are different (the deuteron is much smaller). But if instead of imagining a comparison between the two forces for particles at the same distance, you just think about the &quot;strength&quot; of the force as being related to how hard the two particles try to bind to each other when left to their own devices, this gives you a sense.</p>
<p>The binding of the deuteron is almost 3000 times stronger than protonium, which tells you that the residual strong force between two baryons is generally stronger than any electromagnetic forces between them. Another way to compare is to compare the strong and electromagnetic contributions to the single-particle energies of nucleons bound inside nuclei, but that's harder to go through in a Reddit comment, and the qualitative result is the same.</p>
<p>The weak force is even harder to come up with a numerical comparison for, since not only is there no simple classical expression for it, but the weak force also doesn't really form bound states in nature. So trying to compare binding energies of bound states like I did with the strong force doesn't really work either.</p>
<p>But without going into detail here on the weak force, the ordering of the relative strengths of the fundamental forces at typical energy scales is:</p>
<p>Gravity &lt;&lt;&lt; Weak &lt; Electromagnetic &lt; Strong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gravity is the only interaction that has a single type of charge. The more mass you add the stronger the gravitational attraction gets. That's not true for the other interactions, and because they are strong macroscopic objects are generally neutral (or very close to it) for these interactions. Add an electron to a proton and you form a neutral atom which interacts very weakly with electric fields. Combine quarks to a color-neutral hadron and the strong interaction of that object with others gets much weaker than the strong interaction between particles with color charge.</p>
<p>As an example, if there would be only one type of electric charge then gravity would be completely irrelevant because electromagnetism would be the only relevant force on large scales.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two senses in which gravity is weak, I will try to explain both.</p>
<p>The first one has been addressed by the other comments: if I take two particles some distance apart (for instance two protons), the gravitational force between them is much weaker than any other forces that act. /u/RobusEtCeleritas gave some nice examples for this.</p>
<p>There's another important sense in which gravity is the weakest fundamental interaction. Gravitational interactions are suppressed by the Planck scale. Roughly speaking, this means that if I collide two particles, gravitational effects are only significant if the energy of the particles is of the order of the Planck mass or greater. If I collide particles at energies substantially lower than this, I don't need to know <em>anything</em> about gravity to predict what will happen, because the gravitational effects totally decouple at the energy scales I'm dealing with.</p>
<p>On the other hand, weak interactions are suppressed by the electroweak scale, which is set by the mass of the Higgs boson. This is about 17 orders of magnitude less than the Planck scale, so weak interactions become important at a much lower energy than gravity.</p>
<p>So this is a precise way in which gravity is the weakest fundamental interaction: if I do an experiment colliding particles, and gradually increase the energy, I have to go to very high energy before I can detect any effects of gravity. The same is not true of the other forces.</p>
<p>Incidentally, within the Standard Model of particle physics the relative weakness of gravity leads to an important theoretical puzzle called the hierarchy problem, which I'm more than happy to discuss further if anyone's interested.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The strength of a force can be rated by what happens when two forces are in conflict. Gravity can be overcome by static electricity, which is witnessed by sticking a balloon to the ceiling. There are way more particles in the earth (and the balloon) than there are charges on the balloon, so on a particle to particle basis, electricity is quite a bit stronger. Similarly the gravitational force between two particles does not overcome the strong or the weak force. In order for gravity to prevail over these forces, the number of particles exerting gravity must be huge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
