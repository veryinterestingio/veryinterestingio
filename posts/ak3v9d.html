		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The US Government estimates the number of illegal immigrants based on data from the US Census and Department of Homeland Security.  </p>
<p>Every year the US Census conducts a mini census called the American Community Survey which mails out census forms to about 3.5 million families.  These forms don't ask for citizenship status, but do ask whether you are domestic or foreign born.  They then take this number and modify it a bit to account for people who don't respond and a few other factors, after which they have a decent estimate for the total foreign born population in the US.</p>
<p>They then take that number of total foreign born individuals in the US and subtract it from DHS data on the number of legal immigrants who are still in the country.  This difference between those two numbers produces an estimate for the number of illegal immigrants in the country.</p>
<p>The US government doesn't estimate the cost of illegal immigrants (although I think they might have done so once, a few decades ago, they don't modernly).  Rather, when you see estimates those come from political action groups or researchers.</p>
<p>Groups in that category can estimate the costs however they want, and frequently do.  However, a reasonable way that costs <em>could</em> be calculated is by using the known marginal costs of public services.  For example, if you know that on average it costs a city $100 per person, per year for public services (such as police, fire, education and infrastructure maintenance) and you know that there are 1 million illegal immigrants in the country, then you can estimate the cost of those immigrants as being $100 million.  </p>
<p>But even if you do it like that its still difficult for different estimates to come to the same number because you have to determine what public services you count, as well as determining overall usage rates, as illegal immigrants tend to &quot;use&quot; such services at different rates than legal immigrants.  IE, illegal immigrants tend to be incarcerated more often than legal immigrants while using fewer social services, but the actual rates of that are controversial.</p>
<p>And again, private groups can estimate costs however they want.  Most groups doing such estimates are political, and the more political the estimator, the more likely that the estimate has been manipulated to fit their agenda - and concern over political bias, or the perception of it, is why the US government doesn't attempt to estimate costs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Majority of illegals in the US are people who came to the country legally on visas and then stayed and disappeared once their visas expired. With that information of who stayed it's very easy get a starting number. Then you factor in lots of other variables and you get a more accurate number.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an educated guess. Survey random populations, extrapolate to generalized population. Cost is even more nebulous. You can add or remove parameters. For example, someone could assume that black market laborers work for less than legit laborers. The displaced legit laborers can get government assistance, or might lose buying power, so you make guesses as to the impact.</p>
<p>Bottom line, when anyone quotes the estimated population, it's probably reasonably close. The math and methodology can be verified. </p>
<p>The cost is another thing. That will depend on what the people dosing the survey deem as costs, and it is entirely unverifiable. </p>
<p>There is typically a very wide margin of error. Those who wish to maximize the supposed impact will choose the extreme end of the possibilities as will those who wish too counter them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This show on Science VS about immigration was interesting.  It was not entirely about &quot;illegal&quot; immigration though that was part of the discussion.   One really interesting thing was that there may be some increased costs to immigration,  they were outweighed not just by the addition of economic activity but the children of immigrants tend to add much more to the economy and earn higher wages.  Definitely worth a listen if you are interested in a subject mostly clouded by rhetoric.  </p>
