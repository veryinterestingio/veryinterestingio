<p>Can they get ticks and lice? </p>
<p>Since they would be underwater most of the time, wouldn’t the ticks and lice drown?</p>
<p>Also can water living mammals get ticks and lice?</p>
<p>Edit: I see a few replies about aquatic parasites etc, those I do know of. It’s specific to ticks and lice as we know of on land animals.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work in a medical zoology lab. Ticks are incredibly resilient, I had some specimens I captured last an entire year in a fridge with no food, so if one latches onto say a platypus or beaver, they may be able to continue feeding despite surrounded by water. Insects and Arthropoda breathe through their skin, but can also get nutrients they need through feeding and or change their metabolism during different activities to continue feeding/do their job </p>
<p>It all depends on the species and the duration of time in the water, but it’s absolutely possible for lice and ticks and other parasites to remain on animals like this</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver_beetle" target="_blank">beaver beetle</a> is an ectoparasite that lives on beavers exclusively.  It's not a true louse, but it's very much like them and convergently evolved many of the same solutions to their problems.</p>
<p>The genus <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01647958908683841" target="_blank">Schizocarpus</a> are fur mites that are found on beavers.  Those are arachnids and closer related to ticks than lice.</p>
<p>Brazilian spotted fever is a zoonotic disease that is caused by ticks in the genus Amblyomma and the main host for the tick that carries BSF is the [semi-aquatic capybara.]  (<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0007734" target="_blank">https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0007734</a>)</p>
<p>Simply put, the answer is yes.  One thing I don't know, and I wish I did, is how they maintain O2 levels underwater.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of aquatic animals will get regular ticks and lice, possibly leeches in some environments.</p>
<p>Marine mammals can also get parasites and entrusting/biofouling organisms (e.e. barnacles of whales)</p>
<p>Whale lice are pretty huge! They're also specific enough to be able to tell where and with who whales have been <a href="https://www.hakaimagazine.com/news/the-stories-whale-lice-tell/" target="_blank">hanging out</a> to breed based on their lice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Spiders are know to &quot;hold their breath&quot; for very long times. In fact, they rarely drown and they are quite insensitive to pesticides that need to be breathed in to work.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know ducklings are very vulnerable to lice. The eggs at least can be removed with a clean eyelash brush. I believe lice can hold their breath for 8 hours under water. Ticks can’t swim but most likely cling on to the host’s skin and hold their breath even longer than lice (about 48 hours). Lice and ticks are mainly land parasites but can survive for quite a while under water. I’m sure there are aquatic equivalents to each.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
