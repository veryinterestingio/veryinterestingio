The energy difference between them isn't huge. Why is it that microwave ovens then heat food so efficiently? Is it because the oven uses a lot of waves?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wifi antennas are less than 1 watt, spread over an entire house. Microwave ovens use 1100 watts (where I live anyway), and the construction of the microwave keeps all those waves contained in a tiny box.</p>
<p>So the difference is the concentration of that energy. The microwave is orders of magnitude more powerful and its energy is confined to a much smaller space.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Microwave ovens have an operating power of about 1000 W, depending on the model. Routers and access points, on the other hand, are limited by law in how much power they can use to broadcast. In many jurisdictions this limit is 0.1 W. Many devices will be below this legal limit.</p>
<p>So a microwave is 10,000 times more powerful than a router. Given enough wifi routers, you could also heat up food. If you could somehow manage to stack them all in a small space (and even then the processing electronics of the device would generate more heat than the microwave radiation).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, basically.</p>
<p>Your WiFi signal does 'heat food' in exactly the same way that the microwaves in an oven do, it's just extremely low power so you will never notice any heating effect.</p>
<p>Exactly the same as how normal light levels let us see and bright sunlight is gently warming, but use a huge focussing mirror to up the intensity and you can cook food or set things on fire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another important component that people are missing is that a microwave is designed to concentrate and amplify the heating effects of the microwave radiation.</p>
<p>The chamber of the oven is a <em>resonant cavity</em>. Its shape and size are designed to resonate with the frequency of the microwaves. This causes microwaves to bounce around inside the chamber, which causes them to form standing waves. The waves will interfere with each other to effectively increase power and create localized hot spots (which is why the food spins).</p>
<p>A microwave oven is designed to pump power into the cavity and keep it there. The energy is concentrated to do useful work (heating stuff).</p>
<p>A router, on the other hand is basically the opposite. You have an antenna that is designed to throw the energy as far and wide as possible. Because the energy is so spread out, you get a pretty tiny amount of actual power received at any given location. Remember that EM radiation falls off with the square of the distance. See: inverse square law, it's actually a lot more intuitive than you'd expect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of great answers here, but I want to emphasize how much of a difference there is in the strength of a WiFi router and a microwave oven, and why you don’t have to be afraid of WiFi.</p>
<p>We use lasers for lots of things. If you’ve been on Reddit for a while, you’ve probably seen videos of a laser burning through steel beams. Well, lots of those emit light in the visible range, meaning they’re putting out the <em>exact</em> kinds of photons as Christmas tree lights. The only difference is that there are an awful lot more of them, and they’re concentrated into a beam. But really, you could use a set of mirrors to split off part of that beam and have a perfectly nice and safe lit up Christmas tree. The amount of energy in each photon is exactly the same.</p>
<p>It’s the same with WiFi. The photons it emits are the same as the ones in the microwave, but at completely safe levels.</p>
<p>Oh, and while we’re at it, same for 5G. Each 5G photon is <em>waaaaayyyyy</em> less energetic than a visible light photon, so it can’t do scary things like rearranging electrons in your body. The only way 5G-frequency photons could hurt you would be if there were enough of them in one tight space to warm you up like a microwave oven does.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
