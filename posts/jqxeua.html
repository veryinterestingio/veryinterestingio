		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The heart has an electrical signaling system that causes it to contract. Normally, the electrical impulse travels in an orderly way through the heart to cause it to contract smoothly. At times, the signal doesn't reset properly or conducts in a weird way. This sometimes results in part of the heart contracting at the wrong time, and you feel it as you described. It is called a palpitation. For most people, occasional ones are caused by things like too much caffeine. However, more frequent ones and longer lasting episodes can be dangerous and you should get it checked out by a doctor (insert standard warning about medical advice from internet strangers here).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These are called palpitations and it's usually caused by the heart not quite getting the firing order of it's intricate dance just right. Another way of thinking of it is a half beat instead of a full beat. Usually we don't notice them, but sometimes when we have several in a row, or they occur sporadically over a short time, we become aware of the sensation. </p>
<p>The heart is one organ, but it doesn't just squeeze and relax to pump blood, instead it has a carefully choreographed series of contractions that force blood through the various parts of the heart in an orderly fashion. When there is a problem with this firing order, you perceive it as a skipped beat. </p>
<p>They are usually nothing to worry about as long as you're not having more severe problems like light headedness, shortness of breath, etc. I'm not a doctor and so you shouldn't take any of this at face value, and should instead ask a doctor if you're having them and are concerned. </p>
<p>Palpatations can be brought on by changes in electrolyte levels, dehydration, stress, drugs like caffeine or tobacco, stimulants, lack of sleep, basically anything that makes the heart work harder and the body under more physical stress.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of those are &quot;premature ventricular contractions,&quot; or PVCs, where a heartbeat is occasionally triggerered from a group of cells in the heart other than the normal pacemaker source (the sino-atrial node.) As the PVCs happen at an unexpected time in the heart's electrical cycle, they show up as extra beats (and make a wild signature on an EKG.) Often, the heart will pause after a PVC to &quot;reset itself&quot; and things return to normal.</p>
<p>Everyone has a PVC once in a while, but PVCs are much more common when one has certain conditions such as cardiomyopathy (a heart muscle abnormality that often is involved with an enlarged left ventricle, and leads to a condition known as congestive heart failure.) Extremely large numbers of PVCs, which lead to a feeling of weakness, can be treated by ablation (where a catheter is maneuvered around the heart to a place of abnormal triggering and is used to basically heat up the group of cells to make them die.) Also, anti-arrythmics such as amiodarone can be added, though they have many possible side effects and are usually used as a last resort.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what several people have said about electrical impulses not being timed right, the pause that you feel sometimes ( it feels like a skipped beat but isn't) is one of the heart chambers filling longer than it normally would before it squeezes and pumps the blood out again. If it's on the top or Atrium it's a premature atrial contraction or PAC, if it's on the bottom or Ventricle it's called a premature ventricular contraction or PVC. PVCs are more worrisome then PACs. The beat that comes after the prolong filling of the chamber can make you feel a little funny for a split-second as you get a big whoosh of blood. I've heard some people describe it as kind of a roller coaster feeling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
