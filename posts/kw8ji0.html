		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>your personal data is not that precious.  but bulk data of 1000s/10000s of people is precious.  no one is gonna give a shit about your personal preferences, but if 1000s or 10000s of people share the same preferences, well then.  that's something.</p>
<p>with enough random data points on a million different things, smart enough AI, could begin to accurate predict your behavior and other people's behavior.  ie how target figured out a teenage girl was pregnant and started sending her coupons for diapers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>See Cambridge Analytica Scandal for more paranoia. Data scientists can uncover hidden patterns using algorithms, which can be used for good or bad. Knowing how most inventions go, it's mostly used to benefit the company that the scientist works for. Recommender systems would look at your history of purchases or chats with friends and use them alongside a character profile to suggest products. But when you understand that these people also design the UI, you can also appreciate the fact that they could build nefarious designs like different prices for different people. This would be at the lesser end of the evil and most of it is already happening, for eg. in the ticketing websites. At the other end is building echo chambers and feeding misinformation based on political agendas. </p>
<p>The larger issue is that power corrupts, maybe not today but one morally bankrupt president or CEO or project manager and you will have 1984 in real life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It is not that some company is interested exactly on your data, but when we have a big collection of data, paired with the right computer algorithms,  we can get a lot of hidden information, and ads are only a small part of it  (this video gives some really cool examples (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pHzROP1D-w" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pHzROP1D-w" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pHzROP1D-w</a></a>), like anti-theft systems in cars that use the way you sit as a fingerprint, algorithms that can detect the odds of you causing an accident, etc)  </p>
<p>The big concern with how companies deal with your data started with the cambridge analytica scandal, where this firm used facebook data to promote the election of fascists governments around the world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Besides what a lot of other redditors have mentioned about targeting advertisers to you, the other thing about your data is that it allows platforms to figure out how to keep you hooked on the platform. Let’s take Facebook as an example. If you like someone’s posts a lot or spend a lot of time on someone’s profile, they’ll start sending you notifications whenever they post and even tease you with part of the posted content. But when you open the notification, it’ll just ask you to open Facebook to see the content.  This encourages you to continually use their platform. Reddit does this too.</p>
<p>Since this is ELI5: you like Jill because she is pretty. Facebook knows you like Jill because you keep looking at her pictures. Jill just said something cool. Come to Facebook to find out what she said. You doing something else? Nah, here’s another reminder that Jill is saying something cool. Please come to Facebook.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Imagine this, wherever you go, for whatever need you have. Thirsty? Coca Cola everywhere. Cold? Hot Coffee everyhwere. Horny? Kinky stuff everywhere.</p>
<p>Eventually, you - or at least somebody - is going to buy advertised stuff.</p>
<p>But did you really need a Cola? Water would've done it. Did you really need a Coffee? You were almost home. Did you really need that bondage rope? You're single.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
