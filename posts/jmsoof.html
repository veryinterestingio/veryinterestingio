		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Coronaviruses constantly mutate, picking up new genetic sequences, and these sequences are passed down to their descendants. There are tens of thousands of different genetic sequences among the SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses in the world. </p>
<p>Does that mean there are tens of thousands of SARS-CoV-2 strains?  Not as virologists use the term “strains”, and really not as anyone with common sense would use it.  Minor differences between individuals that don’t have particular functional effects don’t get called strains. You really need to have a functional difference in the virus’s ability to transmit, or cause disease, or infect some other species, or avoid immunity - some <em>functional</em> difference - before you’d say a genetic difference is a new strain. </p>
<p>Early on in the pandemic, the media didn’t grasp this, and non-virologists (and publicity-hungry virologists, to be fair) declared that there were ten, or fifty, or a thousand, different strains of SARS-CoV-2. That’s nonsense. There is either only one strain of SARS-CoV-2 in circulation, or two.  The second <em>may</em> transmit a little better, but doesn’t seem to have any other functional differences. </p>
<p>Here’s a slightly-outdated article, from May:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More important, they’re not convinced different strains of the coronavirus exist at all.</p>
<p>“We have evidence for one strain,” says Brian Wasik at Cornell University.</p>
<p>“I would say there’s just one,” says Nathan Grubaugh at Yale School of Medicine.</p>
<p>“I think the majority of people studying [coronavirus genetics] wouldn’t recognize more than one strain right now,” says Charlotte Houldcroft at the University of Cambridge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/05/coronavirus-strains-transmissible/611239/" target="_blank">The Problem With Stories About Dangerous Coronavirus Mutations. There’s no clear evidence that the pandemic virus has evolved into significantly different forms—and there probably won’t be for months.</a></p>
<p>A little while after that, the potential second strain, D614G, was recognized.  The difference between this strain and the previous one is that it seems to be able to transmit slightly more easily. Here’s the most recent study on that (October 26):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hamsters infected with the G614 variant produced higher infectious titers in the nasal washes and trachea, but not lungs, confirming clinical evidence that the D614G mutation enhances viral loads in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients and may increases transmission. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>—<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2895-3" target="_blank">Spike mutation D614G alters SARS-CoV-2 fitness</a></p>
<p>What this variant does <em>not</em> do is:</p>
<ul>
<li>cause more severe disease</li>
<li>avoid immunity</li>
</ul>
<p>The vaccines made against the original strain seem to work perfectly well against D614G.  </p>
<p>And that’s it, so far.  Plenty of mutations.  Two strains, if you think that slightly higher infectiousness justifies a “strain” designation; just one, if you think some more significant functional difference would be needed for “strain”.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doing my master in infection and immunity. Essentially the viral replication process is inaccurate in Corona Virus. When it replicates there are small mutations in its Genome, some of which are useless, some of which are probably detrimental to the virus and some which make it potentially more dangerous.</p>
<p>There are millions of viral genomes being replicated in an infected person, this gives rise to millions of mutations.</p>
<p>Of course, we only need to worry if it makes the virus more harmful.</p>
<p>In this case it appears to have not in any significant way, although these mutations can be used as a way to trace outbreaks and origins.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p><strong>This is why you don't want to achieve herd immunity by just letting it run it's course through a population.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
