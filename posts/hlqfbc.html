		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't solely eat giant squid- from what we can tell, they require about a ton of food per day, so they eat all kinds of fish and squid. That being said, giant squid are obviously the most well known prey item for sperm whales as far as humans are concerned, and likely a very desirable one for the whales, since its a high payout- one hunt equals a huge, energy rich meal, instead of swimming after numerous smaller things. They find them the way most cetaceans do; with echolocation. They don't have the characteristic &quot;singing&quot; that some of their filter-feeding counterparts are known for- instead, their large head (filled with fatty tissue) and their spermaceti organ (where the oil is that whalers seek, mostly in the past but still to a certain degree today) is used to amplify clicking sounds made by their nasal passages and a pair of clappers called &quot;monkey lips&quot;. It appears that, as the sound bounces back to them, they use a pad of fat in their jaw that is attached to their inner ear to absorb and interpret the sound. They use this same system to make different clicks and sounds to communicate with other whales. Its even come.out fairly recently that they have certain series of clicks to identify different members of their clan- essentially, names. </p>
<p>As far as hunting though, it can be broken down a little bit- if they send out a &quot;click&quot; and it bounces off the hard parts of a giant squid (like its beak), the amount of time it takes to bounce back tells the whale how far away it is. The &quot;shape&quot; of the wave tells it how large it is and what shape it is- and if you're a whale that means you now know what it is. Its been determined that they can find a relatively small squid up to a mile away- now imagine it was a big squid, or a school, and you had multiple whales hunting that can all hold their breath for over an hour. While I'm sure its difficult, it doesn't sound nearly as impossible as rooting around in the dark abyss with eyes that rely on light. They can essentially see down there with echolocation. </p>
<p>We're still learning an awful lot about them (I read a paper about the function of their teeth just last week) so I'm sure that, even in the next 5-10 years, I could come update this answer with more info. Either way, I hope this explains it satisfactorily, but feel free to ask if you have more questions</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What happens when the squid realizes a sperm whale is coming for it? Are sperm whales just faster swimmers than their squid or fish prey? Iâ€™ve been wondering about this because the fish they eat must not be too small, but not too fast to just swim away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
