		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The terms are interchangeable in casual use, though technically there are differences.</p>
<p>A lake is surrounded by land, and is usually fresh water. A lake can be large, as with the Great Lakes. They might be salty, as in the Great Salt Lake.</p>
<p>A sea is usually a subset of an ocean, like the Mediterranean Sea; it is connected to the Atlantic directly, but only with a narrow passage.</p>
<p>And within the Mediterranean there are named Seas. The Agean and Adriatic are the best known, but there are technically others. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea#/media/File:Mediterranee_02_EN.jpg" target="_blank">Link</a>. There is the famous <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/sargassosea.html" target="_blank">Sargaso Sea</a> in the middle of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>These seas-within-seas are usually defined from other areas by distinct changes in water temperature, salinity, color, aqualife, and currents. They may also be defined by geographic landforms, though not always.</p>
<p>Inland lakes, like the Great Lakes, are sometimes called inland seas because:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They may develop currents</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They may have areas within them that have different temps, Oxygen levels, etc;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They can develop distinct ecosystems [which a pond or small lake usually can not do].</p>
</li>
<li>They can have a naked-eye impact on local climate, ie you do not need special equipment to detect differences in climate near the sea as compared to far away. Differences in rainfall, snow, temperature moderation, etc can all come into play. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake-effect_snow" target="_blank">Lake Michigan and Erie are both famous for impacting regional snow falls, edit:and Ontario...and Huron...and Superior</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For these inland areas like the Caspian or Lake Superior, are they Lakes? Yes. Are they seas? Yes. Or at least, mostly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it's just terminology.  </p>
<p>a lake is an enclosed body of water.  a sea is a body of water that has an outlet to the ocean and is at &quot;sea level&quot;.</p>
<p>the Caspian sea was named so long ago before these &quot;definitions&quot; were made</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to a geography professor I once had, any body of water connected at sea level to the Oceans is a sea. Flowing bodies of water that aren’t at sea level are rivers and stagnant bodies of water not at sea level are lakes. There are gray areas such as estuaries and elongated, slow moving bodies of water that fit the definition for both rivers and lakes, but that’s the general rule.</p>
<p>By that definition, the Caspian is a lake, while the Black remains a sea due to its sea level connection to the Mediterranean which is connected at sea level to the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>Why is the Caspian called a sea then? Simply because it was named long before the definition was standardized.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
