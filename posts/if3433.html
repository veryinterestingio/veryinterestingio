		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A previous comment is correct that thirst regulated by osmolarity sensors associated with the hypothalamus, but I want to provide some more detail about that mechanism because it is really cool. </p>
<p>You actually have an osmolarity sensing organ in your brain called the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT). This is a structure that is adjacent to the fluid-filled ventricles of the brain and has a minimal blood-brain barrier - so it can interact with blood vessels and sense the osmolarity of the blood. This sensor is also adjacent to the hypothalamus - so it can interact with brain regions that control thirst.</p>
<p>It is well understood that cells will change their volume when challenged with an extracellular solution that contains too much or too little salt. This is also true of cells in the OVLT as they experience extracellular salt changes in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid. The OVLTs express mechanically activated ion channels that respond to these changes in cell volume, which essentially stretches or shrivels the cell membrane. This generates an electrical signal that can  be transmitted to neurons in the hypothalamus.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When our body is deprived of water, our blood volume decreases while our blood salt concentration increases. This change is detected by pressure receptors in our cardiovascular system and salt-concentration system in our hypothalamus.</p>
<p>Vasopressin/antidiuretic hormone (ADH) containing neurons receive this information about the changes and respond by releasing vasopressin, which directly acts on the kidneys and leads to reduced urine production and water retention.</p>
<p>The kidneys release an enzyme, <em>renin</em>, promotes the conversion of <em>angiotensinogen</em> (protein from liver) to <em>angiotensin I</em>, which gets degraded to <em>angiotensin II</em>. Angiotensin II directly effects the kidney and blood vessels to increase blood pressure. Angiotensin II is also detected by the <em>subfornical organ,</em> in the telencephalon. This area activates cells in the lateral hypothalmus, producing an overwhelming thirst to promote drinking.</p>
<p>To some extent, our brain is controlled by our kidneys and I think that is somewhat ironic and fascinating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Resuming it, our hypothalamus has a group of neurons that work as an 'osmolarity sensor. Mainly focusing on sodium levels, the more concentrated the blood, the thirstier you are, since it assumes you are lacking water to make your blood go up in concentration.
If I recall correctly, there's also ADH (antidiuretix hormone) involved, not sure if directly in the thirst feeling. Those neurons are also known as thirst center, you can search a bit about it, I'm sure you'll find some neat stuff!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blood pressure regulation: Kidneys are equipped with baroreceptors, pressure sensors. Your blood volume affects the rate and pressure at which blood passes through the kidneys. If the kidneys detect low pressure, they can trigger a whole series of hormone reactions to constrict blood vessels and to retain water by also retaining salt. This is also a process that can go awry with high blood pressure, kidney disease, and heart disease, so on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When your blood osmolarity is too high, meaning it is too concentrated and needs to be diluted, your hypothalamus (control center of the brain) detects this and causes the nearby posterior pituitary to release antidiuretic hormone (ADH aka vasopressin) into your blood. Upon reaching your kidneys, ADH enhances the permeability of your kidneys to water so they reabsorb more of it back into your body. Caffeine and alcohol block ADH which is why you urinate so much more when you drink them. </p>
<p>Additionally, when your blood pressure is too low your kidneys release renin, which converts a liver protein called angiotensinogen into angiotensin I, which is subsequently converted by an enzyme in your lungs into angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is what reaches your brain and tells it that you are thirsty, it also interacts with your adrenal cortex, thereby causing it to produce aldosterone, a chemical which also increases your kidney's water absorption and increases your blood pressure. Unlike ADH, aldosterone enhances reabsorption by making the kidneys take in more salts, which the water then follows.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
