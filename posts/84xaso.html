		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A number of things can factor in here.  In class you are being bored by a teacher/subject matter that is also possibly exposing you to words and/or symbols that you do not fully understand, which can make you zone out and sleepy.</p>
<p>At home, people often use hand-held devices before going to bed and research has shown this can make it more difficult to fall asleep.</p>
<p>The pattern of going to sleep at night to rest for eight hours is more a recent thing than you might know.  Other sleep cycles/patterns have existed for centuries, such as sleep four hours, wake for some time, then sleep another four hours.  It might not be the right pattern for you to fall asleep in your bed at the time you do.  You might want to make some changes in your life to help you get sleepier when it's bed time, therefore not so much at other times.  Or if it's convenient, experiment with other sleep patterns to see what you like the best.</p>
<p>Tanning bed: oddly enough some people are actually comforted by being enclosed in a small space, to me it's like the opposite of claustrophobia.  I'm one of them, I find it very relaxing to snuggle into small spaces like a tanning booth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kinda piggy backing on u/unaskedforopinion 's comment, there's a lot of things at play that could contribute to having a hard time falling asleep in bed. Falling asleep easily in other places is kind of a clue that it's something about <em>going to bed</em> that stresses you out, because whatever that thing is, is not present at other times.</p>
<p>It could be the sleeping environment - too much light, too much noise, too quiet (making every other noise jarring), uncomfortable bed/pillows/blankets/jammies. Light is a big culprit, even the tiniest glowing LED can be a bother, so check that out first. Get some new comfy jammies that you wear <em>only to bed,</em> it will signal to your brain that it's sleepy time. A blue light filter on phone &amp; computer for a few hours before bed is helpful too, since the blue wavelengths in screens are very wakeful to the mind.</p>
<p>In the same vein, your bedroom and bed should be used for sleeping and sex only. Working or studying makes your brain associate your bed with being awake and focused instead of sleeping. No mindless internet browsing on laptops or phones either. If reading makes you sleepy, thats ok. If it makes you excited, not ok.</p>
<p>Diet plays a role too; limit caffeine to mornings and just overall consumption. Another thing is to try not to have coffee or whatever until you've already been awake for 1.5 to 2 hours. Your body will become reliant on the outside help and decrease your &quot;wake up&quot; hormones. This causes the feeling of never having woken up, which feeds the urge for that 2pm coffee boost, which fuels the restlessness in the evening, repeating endlessly. Reduce (simple) carbs in the evening, like chips, candy, icecream and alcohol. Try not to eat 2 or 3 hours before bed, but if you need a snack go for complex carb + protein.</p>
<p>Ruling out situational irritants, we can then look at psychological factors. If, like me, the second you lie down in bed you start the mental to do lists/ replay of the day's events, then that's the culprit. In a tanning bed, you're not thinking of those things, or even worrying about oversleeping. Sleep comes easily then, as you're lying down, eyes closed, and you've stepped outside of the bed time overthinking ritual so you can actually relax, even if it's just briefly. </p>
<p>To combat that there's a couple options. If you've been lying awake in bed for 20 mins or more, just get out of bed, go to the living room and sit there. Write down what's on your mind if you're starting to obsess over the idea, or just sit in the dark and do something menial like fold laundry. You'll feel tired again quickly and your brain and body will have been able to do something, which relieves the anxiety of whatever task was bothering you. </p>
<p>The other thing you can do is listen to a sleep meditation/talk down thingy, especially one with binaural beats. My favorite is Paul Santisi's fall asleep fast video on youtube, it's about an hour long. No ads, he doesn't have an annoying voice and it's busy enough to keep your brain distracted but mellow enough to make you fall asleep.</p>
<p>So, there's a myriad of causes for falling asleep easily anywhere but bed, some external some internal. Find the pesky pea under your mattress and remove it ?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Most people do not have an easier falling asleep in the situations you describe, than in their bed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
