However, 100% oxygen generates a lot of oxidation (not surprisingly), and will eventually cause injury to the lungs and other organs.</p>
<p>Edit: This only applies to normal atmospheric pressures.  I don't have much experience with high/low pressure systems like you would find in diving, space travel, or other niche applications.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Check out the Divers Alert Network.  </p>
<p>Scuba gear works by forcing compressed air into your lungs at the same pressure as the surrounding water pressure.So, the deeper you dive, the more air you use.  For every 33 feet/10 meters you go down, you increase water pressure by one atmosphere.  </p>
<p>There's a thing called oxygen toxicity.  As your partial pressure of oxygen increases, oxygen becomes more and more toxic.  For example, at normal atmospheric conditions, you're breathing about 0.2 atm of oxygen (21% oxygen with 1 atm).  Once you go to a single atmosphere partial pressure, then you can still live, but you will be time limited.  Safe recreational dive limits is 1.4 bar O2, or normal air at 7 atmospheres pressure.  Even then, you're starting to get into the squirrely zone.  1.6 is considered just silly.  </p>
<p>As compensation, deep divers will breathe gas mixtures with LOWER levels of O2.  A mix of 10% O2 will let you go significant;y deeper, but you'll also pass out if you try to breathe it at less than 30 feet.  (30 feetis 1 atm water pressure plus 1 atm of air pressure = 2 atm.  O2 at 10% x 2 atm = 0.2 atm oxygen, or just what you breathe in the atmosphere.  </p>
<p>You can survive about 24 hours at 100% oxygen at atmospheric pressure.  To live longer breathing pure oxygen, you have to reduce pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One reason is because the high level of oxygen enhances generation of Reactive Oxygen Species--some of which are free radicals. Free radicals eat up organic material and can reak havoc in biological systems. </p>
<p>An O2 molecule in aqueous solution can gain an election to form negatively charged Superoxide Radical (O2-). These electrons can come from dissolved iron or biomolecules. </p>
<p>O2- can be converted in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), among other things.</p>
<p>H2O2 can be converted to the Hydroxl Radical (OH), the most reactive of all Reactive Oxygen Species. (not to be confused with hydroxide OH-) </p>
<p>A 100% level of atmospheric O2 would cause more dissolved oxygen to enter our bodies relative to normal conditions on earth (21% O2).</p>
<p>A consequence of this is enhanced dissolved O2 in the body. This speeds up Reactive Oxygen Specie generation. Too many Reactive Oxygen Species can induce cell death, DNA damage, Protein Damage and are thought to mediate inflammatory processes. Thus manifesting as toxic to the body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the reasons you don't want to breathe pure O2 is that you can collapse your lungs doing this. </p>
<p>Room air is 78% Nitrogen, which means that in the alveoli of your lungs you have about 78% N. N is not well absorbed by the blood, so that N that is just sitting around helps keep the alveoli open. If you were on pure O2 that N would gradually get replaced by O2. Keep in mind that O2 diffuses very readily out of the alveoli and into the bloodstream. With no N present the alveoli collapses. When the alveoli collapse you lose surface area for gas exchange. If this goes on long enough you'd be in trouble of not being able to properly oxygenate the blood. This is bad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
