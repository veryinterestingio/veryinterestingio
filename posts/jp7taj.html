		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are much more likely to notice a single mosquito inside your room because:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The usual value for &quot;Mosquitoes in room&quot; is 0. You would never notice the 1 fewer mosquitoes outside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You spend a lot more time inside than outside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mosquitoes want to be wherever you are, to drink your blood.</p>
</li>
<li>If there are lots of them outside and none inside, it only takes 1 to figure it out and get in, so there are many chances. If you're trying to get that 1 back out, there's only 1 way for that to happen.</li>
