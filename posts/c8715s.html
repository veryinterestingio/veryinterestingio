<p>Depending on size and composition the objects would vibrate, undulate, or temporarily rearrange themselves for a little longer in space if their environment didn't easily remove their excess energy.  Basically, they'd get warmer.  Eventually they would radiate the excess thermal energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

In my understanding that collision would still cause a vibration of both objects, whether in space on not, with vacuum only disabling it from being &quot;heard&quot; anywhere. Assuming there is no medium to carry it through space, you could for example pick up the sound via laser microphone, amiright?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Anyway, the energy would stay in the system. Light can escape, sound energy that would normally go into the air would stay in the objects as vibrations. The vibrations traveling in the objects would gradually dampen, losing their energy to heat. That heat would eventually leave the objects via black body radiation.</p>
<p>Someone else can chime in on other effects, but basically the objects would &quot;ring&quot; more strongly/longer than they would in air and that energy would be converted to and lost as heat rather than sound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Sound and heat are just forms of kinetic energy, but while sound is an ordered motion, heat is disordered.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sound is the vibration of objects in a wave of ratification (spreading out) and compression. The energy will, in part, be released into the objects themselves as sound travelling through solids. Another portion of the energy will be released as sound travelling through the dust and fragments that will be sent scattering around those bodies. Another chunk will be released as heat, from the friction of the surfaces as they are in contact, and another portion will remain as kinetic energy as the bodies bounce off of each other, grind past each other or send chunks of each other flying away.</p>
<p>A good thought experiment to see how these proportions will change due to the need for the conservation of energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
