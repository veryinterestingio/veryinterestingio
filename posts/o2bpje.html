		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With laughter it's important to understand it's a very deeply seated evolutionary mechanism to form social relationships. You can't force true laughter, and you laugh alone much less than in groups (approximately 97% less likely).</p>
<p>Adults usually laugh at things that are amusing. However, babies primarily laugh during social interaction or when experiencing new things. Thus, it is likely to be an evolutionary benefits. The adult is flattered because they think the baby thinks they are funny. The baby laughs in order to illicit attention and learning from adults.</p>
<p>Essentially from an evolutionary perspective they are mimicking adults to increase their own chance of survival.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had no idea that babies got erections until I was dating a girl with a baby in my mid thirties.... I have daughters so when I walked in on a diaper change, kid was like 9 months I guess, and she was having a difficult time putting the diaper on because the kid was hard as a rock with his little baby boner and I was shocked. He was laughing and giggling and just happy as I'd ever seen him. I didn't know they worked like that when we're that young.... </p>
<p>Wow... Didn't think when I woke up this morning that a reason would present itself to post something about a baby boner on the internets but here we are....</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the reasons people laugh is when our expectations have been violated (usually in a benign way). I imagine a baby's expectations are violated near constantly. &quot;Yay, mom's here. Oh shit, mom's gone forever and all that remains are hands. Mom exists again!&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
