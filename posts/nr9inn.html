<p>Now... imagine a LOT of plastic bags. Like a million tons of it. Thats a lot... </p>
<p>If you were to crumple them into a big ball, no wind would move that. It weights a million ton. </p>
<p>However... if you DON'T crumple them together, and they can flow individually in the desert, they just float individually in the wind.</p>
<p>A cloud is (superficially) similar to that...</p>
<p>This is an OVERsimplification of the science, but I think it is simple enough for a 5 year old :D</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the scale of cloud droplets viscosity is a force vastly superior to gravity. Gravity is applied to mass, viscosity* is applied to surface area, and smaller things have more surface than they have mass. Imagine you drop a stone into water - it will sink to the bottom right away. Now if you grind this stone into sand and let this sand fall into water it wouldn’t sink right away, despite being the same mass. It will take its time, and if you stir this sand just a little, it will make a swirling sand cloud in the water which can persist for a few minutes - precisely because sand particles have much more surface area than the original stone while having the same mass. The same thing happens with water droplets in the cloud. Very small water droplets just float on the upward air currents (note that thunderclouds form when there are strong upward currents to begin with). When this droplets become bigger by joining each other (reducing their overall surface area) they start falling to the ground making rain.</p>
<p>Edit: *viscous friction actually.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It's all about density. 1 million tons of water vaper, which is less dense then air, will float.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It also depends on the cloud. A typical thundercloud is about 15 miles in diameter and thousands of feet high. To put it in perspective, the biggest swimming poolin the world is in Chile. It’s 11 feet deep and 1,000 yards long that holds 66 million gallons or about 2 million tons of water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
