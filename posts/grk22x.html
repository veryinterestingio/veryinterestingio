I heard him once say in an interview that before every concert he wonders if this is finally going to be the time that they figure out he's no good.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The feeling that you don't belong wherever you are, because you think you're not smart/good enough to be there. Comes with a fear that everyone will eventually discover that you don't belong on the team.</p>
<p>I think it mostly happens in highly technical environments, where it can be hard to evaluate where exactly you stand in comparison with everybody else. Finding things you're not good at is easy, finding everybody else's skill level is hard, and so it's very easy to get the impression that you suck, even if on the whole you're comparable or better than other members.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Some stuff I've worked on has gone on to win awards- and every single project I've ever worked on has been plagued with the thought of &quot;they're going to think I have no idea what I'm doing and maybe they're right&quot;, even though there's tons of evidence that it's a laughably incorrect thing to get anxious about. Every time. That's imposter syndrome.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
