		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When faced with stressful situations (includes situations that make us sad, like a break-up, or a death of a loved one), the body produces fight-or-flight hormones. These have an effect on the blood vessels on the heart, raising blood pressure and increasing heart rate, which all increases the stress on the heart. Sometimes, these can cause the blood vessels to spasm, periodically cutting off blood supply to a particular part of the heart. This causes the heart pain you feel.</p>
<p>When the heart is faced with this situation repeatedly over a long period of time, the heart becomes weaker and is less able to pump enough blood to supply the body. This condition is known as Takatsuboâ€™s cardiomyopathy or more widely known as broken heart syndrome.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People often times forget the effect that pain and stress has on your muscles. The reason you can read body language is because the body expresses itself physically. Nervousness causes muscles to flex that raise your shoulders, for instance, and incredibly sad and devastated people seem to (in my own observation) suck their chest in, almost right at the solar plexus.</p>
<p>The body is complicated, and any stressor effects hormones and blood pressure, but people always forget about our muscles and their empathetic habit of reacting to how we feel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Feeling sad is a kind of stress. Stress makes your body do lots of wonky things. One of those things is making your heart beat faster or heavier. When you're sad you're not moving around very much, so all that extra blood doesn't do any good, so your chest hurts because your heart is working too hard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Emotions are understood to be &quot;musical variations of primordial sensations&quot; according to Bessell Van Der Kolk in &quot;The body keeps the score&quot;. Which is to say emotions are our frontal cortexs interpretation of layered signals from out entire body. </p>
<p>It is now known that when someone remembers a memory,  their body responds internally with those same primordial sensations it did at time time of the event.  </p>
<p>There is no &quot;just&quot; to emotions.  They are part and parcel of our conscious self which is believed to come from the background information about how we're doing so we can decide what to do with that information.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The heart pumps blood. </p>
<p>Hormones are required for communication to the bodies muscles on how to react to stressful situations.</p>
<p>Hormones get concentrated through the heart for delivery to the body.</p>
<p>It's really just that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
