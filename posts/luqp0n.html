		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but that's not a bad thing.  Even in an old coal-fired plant the conversion is much more efficient than in an automobile engine, all the pollution is in a fixed place where it can be treated, the least efficient plants are closed every year, and eventually it might be replaced by more renewable sources.  All these are better than their gasoline engine alternatives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ol>
<li>The total amount of pollution is less, because even if the electricity is 100% non-renewable (see pt 3 below), huge power plants are much more efficient at getting energy from fossil fuels than a combustion engine can possibly be. A gasoline engine turns less than 30% of the fuel's energy into usable work. With electric cars you get more miles per fossil fuel burned.</li>
<li>That smaller amount of fossil fuels is being burned at power plants. Power plants generally have better scrubbing/emissions control than cars, have tall stacks so the pollution is never at ground level, and are releasing the pollution in remote places rather than where cars (and people) are. Downtown/freeway smog avoided.</li>
<li>In reality the electric power is very rarely 100% non-renewable. So it's already better, and will automatically improve even more as renewable sources become more widely used.</li>
</ol>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is. But there are some aspects that still make them &quot;better&quot; than ICE cars in terms of pollution.</p>
<ol>
<li>you take the source of the pollution away from the cities (where people live) to more remote locations, therefore fewer people are exposed to high levels of pollutants</li>
<li>As electricity production becomes more sustainable, the cars will automatically mirror this improvement if they're electric.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We could talk about how much more efficient an electric motor is vs an internal combustion engine but others have already gone there. Instead, remember that a gas car will burn the same amount of fuel per mile for as many years as it lasts.  Not only does an electric car start as the greenest option, in all but the most extreme cases, an electric car actually gets cleaner over time as the grid is cleaned up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
