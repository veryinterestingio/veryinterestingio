		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not likely. What you're talking about is damage from the shockwave that propagates through the atmosphere after the explosion. Without an atmosphere, there's nothing to propagate the shock. You may be hit directly with the expanding gas from the explosion, but this will be very weak in most situations - the damage from an explosion is caused by the energy it adds to the air, not by the amount of gas it deposits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The mechanisms can be somewhat different, but explosions can be very damaging in space.</p>
<p>Rather than a blast, what you get is more an intense pulse of electromagnetic radiation - heat and light. When it hits an target, the radiation pulse vaporises the surface of the target. This then can produce a destructive shockwave within the target. For a person in a spacesuit, there's your cause of internal trauma.</p>
<p>An explosion in space will also produce shrapnel if the bomb is designed for it. And at very close range the hot gases from the explosion could be damaging.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cody's lab did some experiments trying to answer if you could &quot;hear&quot; explosions (like a ship exploding) in space. He concluded that, yeah, it could sound like <em>something</em>.</p>
<p>Sound travels through air, and if air is expelled in an explosion (and explosions typically involve expanding gasses) you would hear it. It follows that you'd also experience that gas hitting you as a concussive force. </p>
<p>It wouldn't sound like what you typically hear in movies, but you'd hear something as it hit you (or your ship).</p>
<p>Here are those vacuum chamber experiments:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The effect would not be <em>the same</em> of course, but there will still be a concussive force if the explosion is strong enough, though it would be greatly diminished.</p>
<p>Rather than get hit by the large mass of compressed air of a shockwave, you'd get hit by the relatively much smaller mass of the explosive converted into a gas. Its pressure would rapidly decrease in vacuum as it expands without resistance, so the range of the direct explosive force would be much less. Of course, the explosion will also behave in different ways in other regards, but I presume you're only asking about the concussive force.</p>
<p>An explosion from a 1 kT equivalent explosive would most definitely cause concussive shockwaves at 20m. The shockwaves would be the least of your concerns, of course, but nevertheless it'd be one of them!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
