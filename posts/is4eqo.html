		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some cheeses are very low moisture and high salt content and are aged in specific temperature and humidity conditions, they form a hard rind and will store a very long time even in your fridge after they've been sliced open.</p>
<p>Some cheeses are stored with the full wheels protected by a layer of wax.</p>
<p>Some cheeses are allowed to mold on purpose, and I don't just mean 'blue' cheeses that have mold inside them. Soft ripened cheeses like brie have their skin covered in mold and it's part of the flavour. This is also true of some aged sausage, the cheaper version of which will even have fake mold on them.</p>
<p>Some cheese that you think is moldy might not be. Cheddar for instance forms protein crystals that can look like little spots of white mold but aren't at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aged cheeses do go moldy, the key is they are allowed to go moldy in a controlled environment that affects what mold grows.</p>
<p>Or in some cases, the cheese is stored covered in wax, or in a very salty environment, or many other factors to prevent it from molding.</p>
<p>It's much the same way that aging beef improves it, letting beef go off at the back of your home fridge does not.</p>
<p>Or how wines and whiskeys are aged in oak barrels, but once they are bottled they stop aging, and once that bottle is opened, they will eventually spoil.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aged cheeses are kept in a room with controlled temperature and humidity. The cheese you have in the fridge is always exposed to moisture and bacteria from being constantly used/touched and not being properly stored. Which also makes it a prime breeding ground for mold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Daughter of a cheese maker here. What these people are saying is correct. If you buy a good cheese (not velveeta), and you want it to last a little bit longer and not mold, wrap it in parchment paper. Do not store your cheese in a plastic bag. You will kill the good organisms, introduce and lock in moisture, and mold will grow. Parchment (or wax or butchers) paper allows the cheese to breathe and maintain a healthy moisture level. If it's slices or cubes, just eat it quickly. If it's a block or wedge, this method will help. Happy (cheese) eating!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
