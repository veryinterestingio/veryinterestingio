My daughter has been pondering on something mysterious and the adults around her hasn´t provided any satisfactory answers at all. So she wanted me to ask the internet. </p>
<p>When we dry fabrics in the dry-tumbler the duvet cover more often than not swallows parts of the accompanying clothes and sheets, forcing us to turn it inside out to get to them.<br />
&quot;It´s just going round, round and the water goes out so why does it eat everything?</p>
<p>(My suggestion of dry-tumbler gnomes was quickly and rudely rejected)</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think about how big the cover is.  As it turns some of it is still on the bottom of the tumbler as some of it goes up the side.  if there is something on top of the middle and the cover falls down when something is inside it, then it can get trapped inside as it keeps tumbling.  Especially if you have one of the covers that has an elasticy band in the edge, that makes it even more cupped and likely to eat the other stuff.  </p>
<p>Edit holy shit I did not expect my half asleep comment I made while barely paying attention in my statistics class to get over a thousand updoots.  reddit is weird sometimes</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A dryer is usually a big round drum. Some people use other kinds of dryers. Most dryers are machines with round drums. The bottom area of a drum might act like a basket or bowl. The big sheet of duvet is like a butterfly net. The clothes are like butterflies. When the drum spins the clothes that are at the bottom, they toss up like butterflies. The duvet which has become like a net gets them caught in the messy folds of the duvet. When clothes are wet and heavier they get caught easier, and then they make more messy rumples in the duvet. More things get caught. Then all the fabrics dry and they might stick to each other easier too, because of static. Static happens when different fabrics rub together. The water dries from the clothes. The dry clothes warm and dry out the air. Fabric can become like refrigerator magnets where they easily stick together.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think of it like when a bird gets trapped in your house. Sometimes, when a bird is randomly flying around, it can end up flying in an open front door. But then it is far less likely that by randomly flying around the bird will manage to take the very specific route required to escape.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
