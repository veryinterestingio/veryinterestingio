		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most auto correct features &quot;learn&quot;.
Because small fuckups on everyday words happen quite often, after a while the auto correct assumes that is how you want to spell it, because it may be a slang or dialect word, the program doesn't know.
Errors on lesser used words tend to be fixed, because you haven't made that error that often.</p>
<p>That said, lots of auto corrects have the ability to turn off the &quot;learning&quot; feature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They said, that auto-correct has ability to &quot;learn&quot;. But really, in most cases it doesnt. Its easy to test thru the time: you could correct the same words every day or the auto correct can correct you in wrong way every day (so you correct it), but it will not &quot;learn&quot; from the corrections. Not at all, even after months of use. So, I think that auto correct just use some pre-filled correction list from some server or even fixed list inside of the keyboard app. Who know when your mistakes will get to the list, so it will start to correct the mistakes...</p>
<p>I think, at the moment, the &quot;learning&quot; is mostly marketing feature. Hope that after several years, new versions will actually learn something and help peoples.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Like other people have said your phone as learned you like to type out tge. More than likely from it correcting it and you backspacing at some random point.
Look up how to reset it for your phone. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
