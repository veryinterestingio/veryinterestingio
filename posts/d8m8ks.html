Where you are standing you see all the red from those at the correct angle from you. That's why it's a circle. all the red part of the rainbow is at the same angle from you just a different direction. Same for each of the other colors. The sun is behind you so the rainbow shifts a little bit when you move but not too much.</p>
<p>Every person sees a different rainbow. You aren't even seeing the same rainbow from moment to moment. it's all just an interesting effect of lots of little water drops in the sky refracting and reflecting to your eye.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Each drop <del>splits</del> *separates the light into different wavelengths, sending each colour out at a slightly different angle.</p>
<p>You only see the colours that are pointing in the direction of your eyeballs, so a very small range of wavelengths for each raindrop.</p>
<p>So for the raindrops that are lower down, you will only see the purple light, as the other colours are going off at different angles. You see a little bit of purple light from each raindrop which is at that particular angle to your eyeball.</p>
<p>From the raindrops higher up, you only see the red light.</p>
<p>and it's the same for each raindrop in between.</p>

<p>Each droplets of water is like a pixel in the rainbow. They are so far away that you don't see droplets individually, but the picture as a whole.</p>
<p>Now, how do droplets &quot;know&quot; which color to take?</p>
<p>The droplets at the top are red because the color red is refracted more downward by the droplets. The droplets at the bottom are blue/purple because that color is refracted more upward.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you glue a tiny mirror to the side of your neighbor's house. (Don't do this in real life unless you get a parent or guardian's permission.) If you stand near the mirror and look at it, you can see your whole house. But if you stand back, you might only see a tiny bit of your house reflected in the mirror.</p>
<p>Now, imagine you glue a whole bunch of tiny mirrors all over your neighbor's house. First, where did you get all that glue? Second, now you can see your whole house whether you're close to the mirrors or far away. But notice--you are seeing one big reflection of your house, rather than a bunch of small ones. That's because the closer you are to the mirror, the more you can see at once, but as you back up, the mirrors all reflect pieces of the image together, making one big image. (fun fact--this is how telescope mirrors work!)</p>
<p>Now, when it comes to rainbows, the same principle applies. If you could examine a single water droplet in the air, you might see a tiny rainbow coming out of it, but it would be very small and very faint. But the further you get from the water droplets, the more their light combines into a single big image--the big rainbow image we are familiar with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
