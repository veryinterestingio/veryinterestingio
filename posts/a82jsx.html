		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The definition of species is wonky at best. By some definitions the fact that humans and Neanderthals were able to reproduce successfully and produce fertile offspring that passed down genes from both means humans and Neanderthals are the same species. </p>
<p>Something else to keep in mind is that there some Grizzly Bear populations who are more closely related to Polar Bears then to other Grizzly Bears. </p>
<p>Where we think one species ends and another begins is ultimately arbitrary as even if we can all agree that triceratops and wolves are different animals, the minutea of when are two animal different subspecies or species is our decision because we made up the concept in an attempt to classify living beings into categories we can understand. </p>
<p>As a great thinker once said, &quot;The universe is under no obligation to make sense to you.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is because if your definition of species requires them to be able to produce fertile offspring, then you have a common but incomplete definition of species.</p>
<p>It's possible for two organisms to be able to produce fertile offspring and yet be two different species if they fulfill different ecological niches. For example, let's say that there are two species of frogs. One has its mating season in summer, and the other has its mating season in the fall. Even if these species can biologically produce offspring, they probably never will so it's common to call them different species.</p>
<p>You can define what a species is a variety of ways, and it just so happens that there are definitions of species where Neanderthals and Humans were the same species, but there are definitions where they aren't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That was one of the original definitions of a species, but it has proven problematic over the years.  There are many animals that are generally considered different species, but are close enough genetically to produce fertile offspring.  Some examples are coywolves, Africanized Honeybees, and Pizzly Bears.</p>
<p>The reality is that evolution is a continual process, not something that just happens overnight.  When a population of organisms are in the process of separating into separate species, they will remain close enough genetically for quite a while.  And while the separate species may not normally interbreed, that doesn't always mean they can't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The distinction between species is not so simple. The simple &quot;cannot interbreed&quot; is wrong and far too simple, &quot;cannot produce fertile offspring&quot; is still not correct across the entirely of the animal kingdom.</p>
<p>There are even species complexes where species A can breed with species B and B can breed with C, but not A and C (further reading: Ring species)</p>
<p>Modern humans and neanderthals had not yet diverged enough from a common ancestor to the point where they couldn't interbreed. We don't know how successful such breedings were or if there were a mixture of infertile &amp; fertile offspring, but chromosome count and physical differences were similar enough that successful mixing did occur.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
