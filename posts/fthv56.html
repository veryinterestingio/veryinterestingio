		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have stated, rhino horns have no real medicinal value. They are made mostly of keratin, which is materially similar to fingernails and quite unlike bone. In an alternate reality, traditional superstitions would be leading poachers to take the skull and leave the horn.</p>
<p>As a side note, it has recently become possible to produce fake rhino horn that is also made of keratin and is virtually indistinguishable from the real thing. Some have proposed flooding the market with fake rhino horn as a way to drop the price and reduce the incentives for poaching.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So rhino horns are not made of bone - they are made of keratin, the same material that your hair and fingernails are made of.
A rhino’s horn is actually not really attached to the skull. It is a bunch of hairs that keeps on growing, throughout the animal’s life time. Like your hair and nails. However, neither human nails nor hair  &quot;possess&quot; the woo woo properties that some some people believe rhino horn does - unfortunately, one might say. We could save a lot of rhino's by chewing our fingernails instead.</p>
<p>Tldr: horns and skulls are not made of the same material.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it’s mainly because of how humans perceive the horn, and only the horn to be valuable. the chinese had believed that grounded rhino horns are an aphrodisiac. </p>
<p>it’s based on absolutely horseshit, but if you were born in ancient china where stories of mythical beasts were retold over and over and some persian merchant shows up spouting medicinal claims of a horn from this freaky beast which he happens to sell, you might just be inclined to believe it. </p>
<p>of course this was justifiable in ancient times, now it’s mainly part of a desperate grasp onto traditional medicine and cultural quirks by the older generation.</p>
<p>tldr; artificial demand</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The horn is relatively easy to cut off with a saw. Cutting off the head would take quite a lot more work - you would need to cut through the muscle and connective tissue as well as avoiding the bones, not to mention the head's weight. The poachers need to move fast so they don't get caught and the horn is the part that's become the trend to consume.</p>
<p>Rhino horns are mostly a trend for rich people to show off their wealth which jibes with the fact that such a tiny part of the rhino is considered valuable (just like shark's fin.) People will mention that rhino horns are viewed as an aphrodisiac or used in Chinese Medicine but that's mostly how it's marketed... Nobody believes that bullshit. Buying it is just an excuse to show off how rich you are.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Chinese Communist Party has a monopoly on selling &quot;Chinese Traditional Medicine&quot; ingredients including rhino horns. Why do you think the Chinese Govt. reversed it's own ban on rhino horn sales? And who do you think promotes rhino horn sales?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
