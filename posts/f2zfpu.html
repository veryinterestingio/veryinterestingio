		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the muscles in your esophagus push food and drink to the stomach by contracting and relaxing in &quot;waves&quot;. Think of trying to push a small piece of food through a drinking straw: you can squeeze the straw just behind it, and it'll move forward a bit. Then move your fingers forward a little bit and squeeze again. Eventually you can push it all the way through.</p>
<p>The muscles in your esophagus do that over and over again, but instead of squeezing one spot, it's squeezing lots of places all at once, and there are &quot;pouches&quot; of loose spots between the squeezy spots; the food rides down in each of these &quot;pouches&quot; as the squeezy spot behind it pushes forward.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a piece of food or drink can get stuck in a squeezy spot. Then the esophagus muscle tries to squeeze to push it down but since there's something in the way, it HURTS, like any strained muscle. Sometimes the food can stay stuck with that squeezy spot, and it'll hurt all the way down to your stomach.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a speech and language therapy student, so not sure but I think this is what I was taught: </p>
<p>The pipe that goes from your mouth to your stomach, moves involuntarily. So it will move naturally and react to what is happening. Sometimes, it will also just have some spasm or not be ready for what's happening. F.e. when you swallow something thats really cold, it's more extreme of a sensation so the reaction can be different.
So practically: it's just the tube (esophagus) that has a cramp, a spasm or some other strange reaction to a normal action (drinking)</p>
<p>Since I don't study this in English, I hope I used the correct words and it's understandable :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have eosinophilic esophagitis. It feels like what you describe when I'm not managing it. The condition is characterized by an abnormally high number of eosinophils (type of white blood cell) in the tissues of the esophagus. Over time, this can cause the tissue to lose its elasticity (which is necessary to allow the passage of a bolus - a clumped portion of whatever you swallow).</p>
<p>If left unmanaged, this lack of elasticity causes difficulty and discomfort swallowing (I personally experienced it most with dry foods and at the beginning of a meal). In extreme cases, especially when coupled with acid reflux, the damage and inelasticity of the lower portion of the esophagus can cause it to tear, which has the potential to cause internal bleeding and death (there's a series of anastomoses around the lower portion of the esophagus which have significant blood flow).</p>
<p>If you're experiencing difficulty or discomfort swallowing, please see your doctor. Eosinophilic esophagitis can be easily diagnosed with a small biopsy of your esophageal tissue. Mine is managed effectively with Omeprazole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The esophagus has both voluntary (skeletal) and involuntary ( smooth) muscle. The lower part of the esophagus (smooth muscle) can go into spasm, preventing the passage of food. This condition is known as achalasia. In this condition food gets stuck and can be quite uncomfortable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a condition called eosinophilic esophagitis that is essentially similar to an allergic reaction your body can have to different things. This can make your esophagus smaller due to inflammation and lead to things getting stuck. Its a bit more complex than that but....different sub.</p>
<p>I used to think getting food stuck occasionally was normal. Turns out it isn't normal but it is treatable by a few different methods.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
