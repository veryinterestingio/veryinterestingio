		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Muscle Relaxer - Prevents muscle constriction. Keeps them loose and relaxed. Helps with some muscle diseases.</p>
<p>Stretching - Makes the muscle more adaptive to stretch and less stiff. Useful for increasing your flexibility which <strong>may or may not</strong> increase performance in some ways. (Help you get into a proper squat stance, increase ability in certain sports)</p>
<p>Working out - You're putting your muscles through stress which forces them to adapt. The muscle cells are damaged by the stress and they respond by growing bigger in size.</p>
<p>Edit - I had originally said muscle cells increased in number due to exercise here but I was wrong and a bunch of people were right to call me out on that. I'm in pharmacy school and we're going over CHF and there's a lot of hypertrophy and hyperplasia going hand in hand so it was a force of habit. I had also originally posted that stretching makes the muscle longer. Some studies with certain muscle groups (hamstrings) showed no such correlation. Does that mean muscle lengthening isn't a thing? Not exactly as far as I can tell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Muscle relaxers (most popular of which is Flexeril/cyclobenzaprine) help cramped muscles relax by inhibiting the signals to the muscles that start in the spinal cord. They don’t actually work on the muscle tissue itself, they work on the spinal cord/brain stem signals that are the ones telling the muscles to cramp. These are specifically meant to help muscle cramps that are due to injury or dysfunction. They will not improve muscle length or flexibility, they simply reduce the painful contraction associated with cramping/spasm that occurs with, for example, spraining your neck or tearing your rotator cuff.</p>
<p>Stretching (sometimes) improves the actual length and range of motion of a muscle, i.e. flexibility. By holding a stretch for a certain length of time (static stretching), the muscle will literally add more structural units to its end to grow longer. Longer muscles with a greater range of motion are generally healthier because they don’t get injured as easily, and they also don’t put as much tension on the structures they are attached to. For example, tight hamstrings put tension on your pelvis which can cause low back pain. </p>
<p>Sport stretching is different from static stretching, because generally for a sport warm up we don’t hold the stretches long enough to stimulate the muscles to actually grow longer. But sport stretching is still beneficial because it puts the muscle through its full range of motion prior to your workout or sport, which helps it get ready to work and makes it less likely to cramp or get pulled.</p>
<p>Regarding your last topic, “work out,” that’s hard to answer because that is a very broad term. Sticking with the theme of muscle health, I’ll assume we’re talking about muscle. Strengthening your muscles is helpful for a lot of reasons, the most important of which is that strength provides stability for your whole body. For example, having strength in the muscles in between your shoulder blades is important for posture. Muscles that are too weak to do their jobs become irritable. A lot of people get knots and cramps in between the shoulder blades because those muscles are too weak to stabilize the shoulder blades, so the shoulder blades drift apart and pull on the muscles.</p>
<p>TLDR: muscle relaxers work on the spinal cord signals to stop muscle cramps, stretching for a long period makes muscles grow longer, stretching for a short period helps you avoid cramps during sport, and strengthening muscles makes them less mad because they’re better stabilized.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
