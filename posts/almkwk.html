<p>EDIT: <a href="https://youtu.be/DpeM4FNXRsE" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/DpeM4FNXRsE</a></p>
<p>Here he is, this is his Guinness world records attempt and he wears goggles on this video because of well, the Frozen corneas thing that happened to him before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our eyes are for the most part made of water. Specific heat, which is a measure of how much energy it takes to warm a substance up, is really really high for water compared to a lot of other substances including air. <em>That means a lot of energy needs to be transferred from our eyes to the surrounding air to make our eyes cool down</em>. </p>
<p>Couple that with the fact that air is a poor conductor of heat, especially compared to water (which basically the rest of our body is made from too). <em>That means energy from our body is moving into our eyes much faster than energy is moving from our eyes to the surrounding air</em>. </p>
<p>Those two reasons together are why our eyes don't freeze in cold weather.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure your question was answered, because you basically asked &quot;Why they don't FEEL cold vs. Why don't the FREEZE?&quot;</p>
<p>Several people have responded as to why they don't freeze, but the reason they don't feel cold, as far as I understand it, is our brain expects certain heat loss at various parts of our bodies &amp; becomes used to it. We feel hot or cold when the heat escaping said part of our body doesn't meet the expectation our brain has &amp; signals are triggered.</p>
<p>Our brain expects a certain amount of heat loss through our eyes &amp; when it takes into account the heat loss it is experiencing in other parts of our bodies in comparison it doesn't freak out &amp; signal the feeling of cold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
