		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you have a wifi network on the 2.4 GHz band, then yes.</p>
<p>Microwave ovens also work on 2.4 GHz, so they could interfere with wifi. Microwave ovens are shielded to prevent the radiation from leaking out, but if the shielding is in somehow deteriorated, there may be some leakage. A typical microwave oven that's active can emit 10,000 times more microwave radiation than a wifi router, so even a small amount of leakage can interfere with signals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, older WiFi devices work on 2.4 GHz, and even modern devices support that because it works better over longer distances, microwaves also run at that frequency, and despite all the shielding some microwaves still leak out and can cause interference, but it depends on the microwave and the WiFi</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually the short answer is no... it cannot “make the signal weaker”.... but the end result is the same. It cannot possibly weaken the signal but as it runs in the same bandwidth frequency... that the information packets can be carried (ie carrier waves)... it will causing interference. Which just mean the signals will get garbled in the noise and make it so that you cannot receive all of the useful packets for your WiFi needs... by loosing it into the background noise that covers up the signal.... </p>
<p>It’s essentially a microwave “scrambler” by “smoking out” the signal. Several other things that operate around your house can also cause interference because they use the same wavelength for carrier waves.... if you live in an apartment with other people using 2.4ghz WiFi or other things... you are likely to also have a bit of interference causing you to have to move closer to your router so that it’s signal is stronger than the other background noise of other devices operating at or near 2.4ghz...</p>
<p>Proximity is your friend... but you might also be able to change the “channel” of your router to a channel that isn’t so... used.... some phone programs will let you “sniff” or listen to that frequency of radio wave and can tell you what frequencies are in high usage and what channels will give you less interference overall increasing its ability to perform without getting smoked out by everything else....</p>
<p>If everyone talks at the same speed, rate, and pitch in a room full of conversation.... it becomes very hard to differentiate one person from another... let alone hear the words in the context of each individuals conversation to understand their message.... the closer you are to a person the more likely you are to understand them... but there are several other people near that it makes you have to be much more close to the person to whom you wish to hear their conversation.... everyone else is lost to the noise....</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would say yes.  My house is equipped with a distributed audio system located in the basement. It works with Google Chromecast audios as the input sources.  Whenever I run the microwave it jams the signal (takes ~10 seconds for it to react).  The wifi router (2nd floor) is almost directly in line with the audio system (basement). </p>
<p>It also plays with my lighting control.  I have UPB switches installed throughout my house that only work intermittently while the microwave is going.  They operate by sending pulses through the 120 volt wiring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
