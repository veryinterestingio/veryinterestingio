		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So a while ago I saw <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2018/11/16/weight-lifting-better-heart-health-running-new-study-finds/amp/" target="_blank">a study</a> claiming that lifting weights is as beneficial to cardiovascular health as &quot;traditional&quot; cardio such as running or even more beneficial.
However, something I have heard quite often is that athletes who perform traditional cardio exercises regularly have a much lower resting heart rate than those who do not, because their hearts are able to move more blood per pump.
Logically, this sounds as if it were very healthy.
However, most people who lift weights but do not do cardio (including myself) do not seem to have a significantly lower heart rate than those who do not exercise at all.
If resting heart rate and overall cardiovascular health were directly connected, lifting weights could not be as healthy as traditional cardio, or am I missing something here?</p>
<p>Sorry for potential spelling or grammar mistakes and thank you in advance.</p></div></div>

Sure there is a correlation between heart rate and heart health, but if your heart rate doesn't fall below 50 bpm, that doesn't necessarily mean that it is unhealthy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>i work in a heart centre. I see a lot of people that assume since their resting heart rate is low ie. 40-50, that they are healthy.. when in fact this is more often attributed to their heart functioning improperly in a multitude of different ways. To correlate cardiac health simply off resting heart rate alone would be silly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: no.  There are a lot of different aspects to heart health - what a low resting heart rate tells you (absent any illness) is that the heart is able to push out a lot of blood per pump compared to the body's resting needs.  </p>
<p>What are the benefits of this?  Well, for one thing, it reduces the total number of times your heart beats.  Anything gets worn out faster the more you use it.  Secondly, if it's able to meet your resting demand easily, it means it can probably &quot;ramp up&quot; and meet other demands that might be placed on it.</p>
<p>But there is a lot more to cardiac health than this efficiency.  Heart attacks, for instance, are caused by plaques of fat that rupture and create clots that block the arteries supplying the heart.  The development of these plaques is a process called atherosclerosis.  Someone with a low resting heart rate and a high degree of atherosclerosis is much more likely to die of a heart attack than someone with a high resting heart rate and no atherosclerosis. </p>
<p>There are also a lot of disease states that cause low resting heart rates.  In this case it is obviously not an indication of cardiact health.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
