		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit: a lot of people answering have gone off of the topic of the difference of the frequencies of the speakers' output and instead explained different sized speakers and other a bit out of context rattling. I appreciate all answers but if anyone really knows why different frequencies create different pulling and pushing, feel free to comment.</p>
<p>Edit 2: comments are suggesting Bernoulli's principle to the pulling of the paper.
How I understood it, is that the higher frequencies mainly move fastest but low frequencies move way more air. Because the low frequencies move a lot of air, the air needs somewhere to escape which is to the side of the paper and thus creating low pressure between paper and the speaker. The pressure on the other side of the paper is atmospheric and thus pushing in the paper towards the speaker because the low pressure is not creating an equal amount of force.</p>
<p>I'm still not sure about the high frequencies but I'm guessing that because it's mainly moving fast and not much air it has the momentum and force put into very few molecules which push on the paper harder than the little bit of low pressure between speaker and paper that is created with only high frequencies.</p>
<p>Correct me if I'm wrong in the comments and if you don't mind please DM me the copy paste of the message since there are many comments to go through.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Speakers vibrate to make sound. Large speakers make lower volume sounds, and do so by moving a lot of air.  Small speakers make higher pitched sounds, but move only a little air. Both types push out and suck in air to make those sounds.</p>
<p>Assuming you are holding the paper with one hand:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the smaller speaker pushes air onto the paper, it does so over a small area of the paper, and that's strong enough to push the paper away. When the same speaker sucks air in, it's not strong enough to pull the paper into the speaker.</li>
<li>When the larger speaker pushes air onto the paper, it spreads that air over a larger area of the paper. The paper won't move as much. When the speaker sucks in air, it does so over a larger area of the paper, and the paper will be pulled into the speaker.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another way to think of it would be to try to suck up the piece of paper while it's lying flat on the table. With a straw, you have to suck in really hard because the force is applied over a very small area. With the toilet paper roll, you don't have to breathe in with the same force because it's applied over a greater area.</p>
<p>Edited for clarity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine the paper is a kid in a swing and the speaker is an adult pushing them.</p>
<p>There's a very specific frequency of pushing that will result in the biggest swings.  It's pushing at the rearmost point of the swing arc.  Speakers pull air as well as pushing, so you'll have to imagine pulling the kid at the front of the arc, too.  The ideal rhythm of pushing and pulling is the resonant frequency, and it's dependent on the length of the swing's chains.</p>
<p>Imagine that you're pushing and pulling at the wrong frequency.  You're pushing while the kid's still moving backwards, or pulling while the kid's at the bottom of the arc.  You can see how the wrong timing could mean less movement, or even uneven swings to the front or back.</p>
<p>The paper has a resonant frequency, too.  Certain frequencies will produce lots of movement, some will produce minimal or uneven movement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming that your source material is a sine wave tone, the wave itself is symmetric, but the behavior of the paper may not be. The paper itself, depending on its weight, size and shape, will have its own natural frequency, nodes and antinodes, etc. In response to symmetrical excitation, the air flow around the edges of the paper may act to &quot;ratchet&quot; it in one direction or the other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
