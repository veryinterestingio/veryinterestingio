<p>Your brain is trying to remember the next part of the song by replaying what it knows. It's tracing its steps to find out where it got lost. It's why the chorus or anything that repeats gets stuck, because you can't remember the second verse, only the first. </p>
<p>To fix, since this seems to be a cry for help, is to listen to the song. Pay attention to the lyrics, or melody if there are none. Sometimes the second I get the chance after a long day of work, I'll put the song on repeat until either my headphones die or YouTube itself tells me to stop, and it's usually put of my head for awhile. Maybe break out those memorization tools from school if it's a particularly bad earworm. </p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Songs, especially pop song, are designed to be catchy.  The chorus is repeated, usually three times in a song and by the second time you hear it you should be able to &quot;guess&quot; how the rest of the song will go.  A well composed song will have a bridge (different part from a verse) and then follow it up with the third chorus.  Hearing &quot;Help!  I need somebody Help! ...&quot; three times or more will get stuck in your head.</p>
<p>There are also things called &quot;earworms&quot; which are practically designed to linger.  Think about the guitar riff to Led Zeppelin's Kashmir and it'll probably repeat in your head for a bit.  You probably read the words &quot;Led Zeppelin's Kashmir&quot; and didn't even have to think about it.  The melody, the rhythmic pattern are just there.</p>
<p>There is some other things (read most of the other comments about not finishing a song) but this is why when you hear something new and fresh and relatable it's just WOW and then you're stuck with it for the next few weeks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Getting rid of an earworm also has a variety of different solutions, including distracting yourself with another song or listening to the stuck song in its entirety.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
