		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work with computer vision researchers who have explained this to me a few times, so secondhand citation syndrome in effect.</p>
<p>Your eye movement patterns are vastly predominated not by conscious, voluntary things like reading, but involuntary onesâ€”so-called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade" target="_blank">saccadic eye movements</a> are happening all the time.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Human_saccadic_eye_movements" target="_blank">http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Human_saccadic_eye_movements</a></p>
<p>Even when your brain is completely convinced that it's doing a very plain, predictable pattern scanning left-to-right or right-to-left, your eyes are actually bouncing all over the place with these involuntary movements, some very small and some pretty significant. This is true even when you're just looking at a single point.</p>
<p>One consequence of this is that relating observed eye movement (e g. via a computer) to perception is very hard. Gaze tracking can very quickly know more about what you're looking at than you do in a conscious sense.</p>
<p>Another consequence to this that's more applicable to your question is that reading directionality isn't going to significantly change the overall usage pattern of your eye muscles, as everyone's usage pattern is still predominated by &quot;little darting movements all over the place.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>But there may be some interaction..</p>
<p>We don't have &quot;eye dominance&quot; the same as handedness. Instead, the entire right field from both eyes may be &quot;dominant&quot; (like handedness) and &quot;dominant eye&quot; is a different process than dominant hand.</p>
<p>Half the visual field always crosses over at the optic chiasm so that everything seen to the right of center goes to the LEFT brain from BOTH eyes, and both LEFT visual fields feed to the RIGHT brain.</p>
<p>Also, most people pick up words tachistoscopically in the RIGHT visual field considerably better than in the LEFT visual field. That's thought due to Wernicke's area for receptive language being located asymmetrically in the left hemisphere, where visual information from the right hemisphere (left field) has a longer path to cross the corpus callosum.</p>
<p>These findings have led many to suspect it's the reason most languages are written/read left-to-right, and only a few (ie Hebrew) are right-to-left.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It all comes down to the muscle memory. For example, person A who has always read languages from left to right would find it a bit hard to read texts right to left. Similarly, Another person B who reads right to left would find it a bit difficult to read right to left. </p>
<p>The difficulty is because the brain is set to recieve the reading cues in a particular direction and takes time to adjust otherwise. </p>
<p>Although, if you would disect and look any tissue, from people across any culture, under microscope, the physiology would be the same. This is because everyone is the same species (homo sapiens). The difference that we see on the surface is due to the environmental and nutritional effects. </p>
<p>It is also important to note that structural genes (the genes which define the structure and components of bones, muscles, blood, nerves etc) are basically the same across a species and since genetics do not have a concept of &quot;culture&quot;, the structural components of human body is identical across the globe.</p>

<p>P.S. Sorry It turned out to be a biology rant on a simple question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
