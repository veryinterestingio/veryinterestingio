<p>Why do white arctic animals have black noses?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's simply because their skin is black.</p>
<p>Both polar bears and arctic foxes have black skin (<a href="https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/12335/images/story_full_width/Medium_WW181942.jpg?1475601751" target="_blank">see for yourself</a>) underneath their thick coats, caused by a high concentration of the pigment eumelanin, and thought to adaptively help them maximise heat absorption and retention. Some likewise argue the high concentration of eumelanin helps protect their otherwise exposed noses from harmful UV radiation. Given polar animals live in a relatively UV impoverished environment, perhaps not. But who knows?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If animals in the Arctic have evolved to have all white fur/hair</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah! Polar bears don't have white hair <em>per se</em>, rather, it's translucent (at least in the visible spectrum). In a similar way to how snow appears white, large numbers of translucent hair fibres in their dense fur scatter and reflect away most visible light; thereby causing the bear's fur to appear white - or the colour of sunlight - to an observer. An abundance of popular misconceptions have arisen in the literature over the years on polar bear fur, mostly around how the 'transparent' nature of their hair allows each one to act like a 'fibre optic cable', allowing bears to 'harvest' the majority of sunlight that hits them and transfer it to their skin to be absorbed as heat: alas, this is all demonstrably false [1][2]*. Only about 10-20% of sunlight hitting a bear makes it down to the skin; the rest is scattered away.</p>
<p>Speaking of misconceptions; given their black noses, it's also often said polar bears will 'hide' their nose from prey during hunting, by pushing a block of ice in front of them, or otherwise hiding their nose behind a paw. There has never been any evidence to support these claims. </p>
<p>In any case, polar bears and arctic foxes (and, too, <a href="https://i0.wp.com/churchillwild.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ArcticHare1.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1" target="_blank">arctic hares</a>) have dark coloured skin which helps them, presumably, better absorb heat, and where their fur coat is thinnest (or absent entirely; i.e. their nose and paws) you can simply see that dark colour. In contrast, ermine have pink-ish skin and pink-ish noses (<a href="https://external-preview.redd.it/fMxFVin9foDV8ZYy54QwjnpHiVC_QHSoindsVR3i1VU.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=2e12d93fded93f20f7668a6d3ad277ba0c7fe63c" target="_blank">image</a>), ditto snowshoe hare (<a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/1581/24576551443_f082234f98_b.jpg" target="_blank">image</a>). As for this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>why do they still have dark colored noses? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a bit tautological, but there hasn't been any evolutionary pressure selecting for lighter skin on the nose. Presumably; i) UV protection, if true, is more important; ii) the required genetic path is too tricky; iii) as their eyes are dark anyway it won't make much difference; and iv) the preferred hunting ground of a bear is either at a <a href="https://external-preview.redd.it/mm8JBOP7HjfCRufaCIFiI7c2EqHAZKN98dkNuOTVTLo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=0af23e848630fbf19e6201adbcff83b0f20fd53f" target="_blank">seal's breathing hole</a>, or looks <a href="https://ak.picdn.net/shutterstock/videos/5329700/thumb/1.jpg" target="_blank">like this</a> (also check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNO0kxTClYo" target="_blank">this video</a> from BBC's <em>The Hunt</em>); under these circumstances, if, as a seal, you're close enough to spot a nose, it's probably waaaay too late!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the hidden question here is that <em>why aren't all parts of arctic animals white so it makes a perfect camouflage?</em></p>
<p>To understand that, we need to understand how evolution works.</p>
<p>On the face of it, a white nose will make the camouflage perfect, sure. But evolution is also a numbers game, and it's never about just one parameter. If camouflage is the only thing that mattered, evolution would have put pressure into make it blend in better. But as others have pointed out, its skin is black for other reasons which are also in play when it comes to natural selection, and evolution has to weigh (obviously, there is no 'prime mover' here, it just happens) in which is better. </p>
<p>Over the millennia, there probably was one or two bears with white noses (and skin) due to a mutation, but given that the disadvantage of that far outweighs the advantage it may gain by having that little extra camo, probably those died out young before they could reproduce, or if they did reproduced, it's children either didn't inherit the mutation or if they did, then <em>they</em> died out. So we're left with animals with black noses because compared to the advantages of a black skin and nose, the disadvantage is smaller.</p>
<p>Also, even with perfect white body, that still isn't a <em>perfect</em> camouflage. It's not transparent, nor the white coat is <em>exactly</em> the same color of snow. Like, if the bear is close enough, or if the angle of light is different, or million other reasons, even in snow, you can actually detect a bear if it's close enough. And don't forget that most animals have a much better hightened sense of smell, a lot of whom even use it as the primary sensory organ. So given all these, the importance of having that little extra bit being white is even lower than you might think. So there really isn't a huge evolutionary pressure to make the nose and skin white.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is because most mammals have black skin,and With white skins humans are case of mutants.</p>
<p>The pigment that makes skin black is melanin, and melanin is also a hormone that controlls calmness, and in a sense, reason. Animals without black skin *tend* to be more aggressive, unpredictable, and usually get themselves killed. Humans have brains big enough to avoid being affected by melanin.</p>
<p>I guess that’s the reason behind their black nose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
