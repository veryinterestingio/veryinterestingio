But since you're not allowed to make decisions based on insider information, isn't it just random guesswork with no real backing?</p></div></div>

Several Hedge funds bought up mobile phone data GPS and used it to notice that Tesla were running 3 shifts rather than 2 in their factories, and so correctly predicted that Tesla were going to meet their production targets. This resulted in a large profit for the hedge funds.</p>
<p>This isn't insider trading, since the data didn't come from Tesla itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most actively managed funds dont beat the market index. If they do they don't beat it for long. Past performance isn't an indicator of future performance in stocks. So a mutual fund that has beat the market for 5 years has no better chance of beating the market than any other. This video explains it very well. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of pretty flippant answers on the board. </p>
<p>I am a quant / developer at an American bank and former trader. Quick note that the banks (Goldman, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley) are generally in the business of making markets (so buying and selling from investors and making a spread) as opposed to truly investing. </p>
<p>Quick answer to the question you are directly asking here, then a whole lot of qualification and preamble.</p>
<p>You are probably getting at what a small subset of the investing word (IE your mutual and pension funds) do with regard to just stocks that is known as 'fundamental investing.' More or less what they do is use public financial statements to project the companies performance in the future, us that to back into a value, and if it's undervalued buy, and overvalued, potentially short / sell. The mechanics of how you short a stock are probably beyond the scope but I can add an explanation if people are interested.</p>
<p>As many have pointed out, it's pretty dubious as to whether or not this reliably works. Overall, for a retail investor playing below 6-figures, you can probably safely buy a couple broad ETFs in a self-directed account and forget about it for a while. You will appreciate with the market over the long run, but you can and will lose money day over day, and even year over year.</p>
<p>Longer (ELI10 or so) below:</p>
<p>Your first question is about stocks. Worth stopping and just noting that the equities (IE stock) market is a compartively small portion of the market compared to fixed income (corparate bonds, mortgages, asset backed securities, gov't bonds). And I haven't even mentioned the interest rates, commods, or fx markets which hedge funds participate in, or the derivatives market which exists for all of those underliers. </p>
<p>Here's a couple reasons why active management (IE anything other than an ETF, or your bank account's interest) exists:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Some funds are so large that if invested passively in an index, they would move that index. Take the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board. If they just tossed all there money into the TSX they would be more than 10% of that market cap. The liquidity constraint would move the price up and they would underperform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'Asset Liability Matching' -&gt; this is probably the single biggest slice of the market. Say I'm an insurance company (though this applies to banks, pension funds, ect. My whole business is taking people's premiums, investing them, and paying out their claims in the future, and maximizing that spread while not coming up short on cash. I need to buy investments that will reliably pay me just enough to cover the claims and leave me some cash as profit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Risk management -&gt; people aren't just trying to max out return. A lot of the time they're trying to adjust to avoid losing more than x%, ect. You gotta do a lotta work to sort out the stats, math, behind that</p>
</li>
<li>Hedge funds - essentially risk taking machines. So all the above want predictable, stable products. Hedge funds basically exists to buy all the other shit and hopefully not get blown up. The essential service of a hedgefund is not getting blown up. IE they buy distressed debt, shitty companies like hertz, they short stuff they don't like, and if it all blows up there's no real business there, so there's not much frictional expense. Result is that they tend to outperform.</li>
</ol>
<p>Mortgage backed securities are a great example for understanding this. Nowadays the 1,2,3 type investors buy the senior bonds, while (4) the hedge funds, buy the shit. If all goes well, they do 15% where as the seniors pay 3-4%. If shit blows up, IE covid, they lose money but the senior bonds are protected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even if everyone has the same data, only few people actually have the skillset to make anything out of it.</p>
<p>A simple example would be when a fund realized that stocks in France fall during rain for whatever reason. So they just adjusted their portfolio based on that observation that nobody else had realized at the time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
