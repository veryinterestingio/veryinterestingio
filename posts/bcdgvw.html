About a year ago, I took the regular dose for a headache and found myself having an allergic reaction to it; coughing, sneezing, trouble breathing.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: We have no idea, but we also kinda have an idea.</p>
<p>Long answer: So basically your body is constantly looking for things to kill. White blood cells of your innate immune system are constantly sampling the environment, taking in proteins and other molecules. Whenever they find something, they take these to lymph nodes and present them to the white blood cells of your acquired immune system. </p>
<p>Your acquired immune system white blood cells are called B-cells and T-cells. The antibodies made by B-cells are responsible for allergic reactions. (Particularly the IgE subtype of antibodies). There are three important things to know about these cells. </p>
<ol>
<li>Each B and T-cell is designed to look for one thing and one thing only.</li>
<li>This thing they are designed to look for is completely random. Their only training is to <em>not look for your own proteins</em>. Aside from that, they have completely random receptors that may or may not ever bind to or find anything.</li>
<li>New ones are constantly being made.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is how you develop immunity to infections, and why vaccinations work. When you're first exposed to an infectious agent, it takes a few days to weeks for your innate immune system to <em>find the right B and T-cells</em> for that infectious agent. You may not even have the right B and T-cells (This is why most people cure themselves of hepatitis B and some people are life-long infected. Some people just don't have the right B and T-cells for that infection). </p>
<p>What this means is you can eat peanuts at age 5 and be fine. Then when you're 7 you <em>randomly</em> produce the specific B and T-cell that looks for proteins in peanuts. Then when you eat a peanut at age 8, you suddenly have an allergic reaction to it. </p>
<p>Now it does get more complicated. If your B-cells produce an IgG-type antibody response against these foreign bodies, you don't get any allergic reaction. Tons and tons of people have immune response to peanuts or pollen. It's just IgG, so they have no symptoms or problems. Allergy requires an IgE-type response. The real question isn't why we make a response to allergens, but why some people produce an IgE-type response. To this question, we have absolutely no idea. Since IgE is used to fight worm infections, some people believe it has to do with regulatory dysfunction caused by us living such hygienic and sterile lives. But that isn't even theory, that's just hypothesis. </p>
<p>Edit: /u/pistonrings is right as well. There is also the concept of molecular mimicry, I forgot to go into. </p>
<p>Basically think of it like this. You have a B-cell that finds a viral protein. It makes tons of antibodies against that viral protein. The virus is gone. Now the B-cell starts rearranging its genes and redesigning its antibodies to be even more effective. During this refinement process, it could potentially produce an antibody that also targets your own cells. </p>
<p>This isn't really responsible for allergies, as far as I'm aware, but is the basis of a lot of autoimmune problems, like Guillain-Barre syndrome.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The immune system will respond to proteins that it recognizes, but sometimes it struggles to tell them apart.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So say you catch a virus and you get really sick and then you get better.  You now have an immunity to the virus, so it can't make you so sick.  Now your immune system can't tell the difference between that protein in the virus and one that is found in a peanut.  So every-time you have a peanut, your immune system responds and makes you allergic.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You may not actually be classically allergic to Ibuprofene.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4446629/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4446629/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4446629/</a></a></p>
<p>While the results are basically the same, the mechanism is different, so take the other good explanations of allergic reactions at the top with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>With this hypersensitivity, the real mechanism is likely related to the effects of Ibuprofene and other NSAIDs have on the immune system.</p>
<p>As to why either allergies of hypernsensitivies just basically appear randomly: We don't actually know yet.
We have quite a good idea about what happens exactly once you are already allergic and are brought into contact with an allergen, but it's currently unknown what causes the initial action of the immune system.
For some reason it starts producing antigens against chemical structures that are harmless, and strongly attacks those.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
