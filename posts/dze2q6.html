		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer to the title question is &quot;always&quot;. The Earth is spherical. Period. Whether the spherical shape of Earth matters to you is dependent on the what you're measuring and your threshold for error.</p>
<p>As to your more specific question...</p>
<p>On a sphere, the area of a triangle formed by three geodesics (arcs of a great circle) is given by</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A = R^(2)(a + b + c -  π)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em> are the interior angles of the triangle and <em>R</em>^(2) is the radius of the sphere.</p>
<p>If you want your triangle to have three right angles, then this formula reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A =  πR^(2)/2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and, as a ratio of the total surface area of the sphere,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>r = A/(4πR^(2)) = 1/8</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if you want to make some sort of journey on the surface of Earth and get back to where you started by traveling along great circles and turning 90 degrees exactly <del>three</del> two times, then the surface area enclosed by your path must be 1/8 the total surface area of Earth. (That's about 3.7 times the land area of Russia.)</p>
<p>Of course, there's no reason you <em>have</em> travel along great circles. In that case, your triangle can have three right angles and enclose an arbitrary small area. But then the sides of your triangle would not be the proper analog of &quot;straight line&quot; for spherical geometry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no &quot;point&quot; where flat 2D Euclidean geometry turns into 3D spherical geometry. It depends on your standard for measurement. Modern surveys and navigation of just 10 km (6 miles) use 3D spherical (ellipsoid) Earth models. Your example of three 90 degree turns, applies at distances of 10,002 km, or a bit more or less depending on exactly where on the Earth you start and turn. And if you did a &quot;square&quot; with sides of 50 km and four turns of 90 degrees, you would end up about 322 meters from your starting point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>For what it's worth... four 90 degree turns don't get you <em>exactly</em> back to your starting point. At least not if you pretend that the Earth is a perfect and smooth sphere (or oblate spheroid) and that you can actually be precise enough with your turns and distance measurements to see the slight deviation. So even in a small patch of (perfectly smooth) ocean, the geometry isn't Euclidean. But it's pretty close.</p>
<p>The closer you stay to your starting point, the more Euclidean it looks; conversely, the further away you go from your starting point, in general, the more obvious it becomes that the geometry isn't Euclidean. So it's a gradual thing, it's not like there's a cutoff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Three 90° turns only works when you go exactly 1/4 of the way around a sphere. You can do it with two turns if you go halfway; pole to pole. It’s not necessarily the number of turns that’s important here, it’s the angle between the sides of a shape.</p>
<p>For any triangle on a sphere, the sum of the angles will always be greater than 180°. For a square, greater than 360. Pentagon, greater than 540°, and so on. As the sides of the triangle grow, so does the angle between them. At the absolute maximum, each angle can be almost 180, at which point the triangle goes around the equator.</p>
<p>In the situation you described, if you did turn <em>exactly</em> 90 ° after rowing <em>exactly</em> the same distance 4 times, you would not end up in the same spot as you started. Your path would look like this<a href="http://www.spoonfedrelativity.com/pages/four-turns.png" target="_blank">look like this</a>, though much less pronounced. You would need to turn ever so slightly more than 90° to get back to where you started.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a question of scale and measurement uncertainty; at what point is it worthwhile doing all the extra maths that non-euclidian geometry entails? We have similar questions about the boundary between classical mechanics and relativity - we managed to get to the moon without using relativistic corrections, but for missions further than that, we need to take general relativity into account.  </p>
<p>With this geometric problem, think about how accurately you can measure your distance and your angles, then work out the difference between calculations done with euclidian and spherical geometry. If the difference between the two is either so small as to be unmeasurable (e.g. for your row boat example), or measurable, but insignificant (e.g. in making a map of your local county/country for motorists to use, say) then you can just save time by assuming a flat surface.  </p>
<p>On scales where the difference is both measurable, and significant (e.g. when making intercontinental flights), then you need to make the effort to use non-euclidian geometry, otherwise you end up landing your plane in the middle of the ocean.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
