		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That may be a weird way to pose the question, but do most species achieve sexual maturity the same amount through their lifespan (e.g. humans take 20 years in an 80 year lifespan and some species with a 100 year lifespan takes 25 and another species with a lifespan of 4 years takes only 1 year)? Or does it change depending on the species (humans achieve sexual maturity  after 20 years in an 80 year life span, but some species with a 100 year lifespan takes 2 years and another species with a lifespan of 4 years takes 3)?</p>
<p>If it’s nothing set, are there any trends? Why do these trends occur? And if it’s completely random, why? Do different organisms take different amounts of time because they have different needs evolutionarily? </p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> said “sexual maturity” because I didn’t think “maturity” was a quantifiable term. If it is, that’s what I meant</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, no. At a local-level among populations of a species or between closely-related species, perhaps, but across the animal kingdom the answer would be 'no, proportionality is not a rule for this characteristic'.</p>
<p>This gets at an aspect of biology called 'Life History Theory' that is concerned with when these major events (birth, death, reproduction) occur in a species' lifespan, and how evolution in response to ecological pressures selects for a 'life history strategy' that maximizes the organism's fitness. You can find a great diversity of life history strategies in the animal kingdom that reflect how an organism has evolved to maximize its reproductive success given its resources on-hand. Granted, the life history conceptual framework is based in models and some idealized assumptions, so it doesn't map perfectly onto every situation, but it can explain some general trends we see.</p>
<p>Just to list a few examples: many insect species spend the majority of their lifespans in juvenile stages and only become sexually reproductive for a tiny period of their life cycle. In one extreme example, the <a href="https://www.eje.cz/artkey/eje-199601-0001_Antarctic_diptera_Ecology_physiology_and_distribution.php" target="_blank">Antarctic midge (<em>Belgica antarctica</em></a>) spends 2 years as a larval grub before molting into a sexually reproductive adult for about 10 days, after which it dies. Completely different life history strategy from mammals, which generally spend most of their lives as reproductive adults.</p>
<p>Even among mammals, you'll find a lot of variation among life history strategies. Humans and humpback whales have pretty similar lifespans (humpback whales might be a little shorter, but we're still learning what their lifespan looks like when we aren't hunting them). But <a href="https://doi.org/10.1139/z92-202" target="_blank">humpback whales achieve sexual maturity</a> around 5 (female) or 7 (male) years old.</p>
<p>And I can tell you that a single species can have multiple life history strategies. There's a great body of literature on the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1982.tb05021.x" target="_blank">Trinidadian guppy</a> that shows how guppies from a high-predation environment show a typical 'r-selected' life history strategy: mature quickly, have a lot of small (cheap) babies, and probably get eaten at a young age. But those guppies, when transplanted to a low-predation environment evolve toward a 'k-selected' life history strategy: mature slowly, have a few large (expensive) babies, and live much longer. I don't know if the changes in maturity and lifespan (actual, not potential) are proportional, that would be an interesting question that you could explore for a given species, but it does demonstrate the flexibility of life history strategies.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No.  Carpet beetles spend one to two years as larvae before maturing, breed, and die within a couple months. 17 year cicadas spend almost their entire lives as nymphs underground before maturing, then breed and die a couple months later. Many other insects have similar patterns of a very long juvenile stage followed by a short adult stage. Some adult insects don’t even eat, living out their short lives on energy stores from the juvenile stage. </p>
<p>In most of the insect examples I can think of the adult stage is capable of flight. The whole point of the adult stage is rapid dispersal to find a mate. The pattern seems to be a long juvenile stage in a sheltered location preparing for breeding by adding body mass and fat stores, followed by rapid dispersion and reproduction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

For example, look up a species of jellyfish dubbed the &quot;Immortal Jellyfish.&quot; This jellyfish reaches sexual maturity then actually reverts to an adolescent state.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The resilience of a species and be dependent on how long it takes to reach sexual maturity. The California Condor can live 60 years. However, it takes six years for them to reach sexual maturity. When they do start to mate, they only lay one egg every other year. They are critically endangered and have already gone extinct in the wild once in 1987. </p>
<p>I guess my answer is no, every species has a different ratio of lifespan to sexual maturity. This can affect the success of species.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
