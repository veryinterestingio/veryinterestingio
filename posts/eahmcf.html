		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whenever you have a scab, chances are there is torn skin or cut underneath it which your body is trying to fix by making new skin cells.
Once the new skin is formed, the scab needs to go so your body releases this chemical called histamine which makes the area under and around the scab itchy, thus ensuring that you yourself will take the scab off.</p>
<p>But action of histamine on the body is pretty finicky and can be difficult to time. So it often happens that your scab might start itching before the underlying skin is finished healing.</p>
<p>This leads to formation of another scab and another attempt at healing....
Human bodies are weird.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically your skin is comprised of thousands of nerve receptors that alert you to the presence of foreign objects or irritations, like a bug crawling on you for example.   During the wound healing process your collagen cells begin to expand and new skin begins to grow.  As the scab dries out it triggers the skin cells to tell your brain that there is activity and something needs to be done about it.   Our natural innate response to skin activity is to itch the source from where the alarm is coming from and thus we end up peeling the scab off.   There are other factors involved too such as the pain-pleasure reward system but most of it comes down to the nerves doing what they are supposed to do and alerting you to stimulus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
