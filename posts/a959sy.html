<p>The copyright-claim system also isn't broken. It's functioning exactly as intended, to prevent large record labels and movie producers from making trouble for Google.</p>
<p>Youtube doesn't care in the slightest about copyright law, they care about not having to spend too much money on lawsuits, so their copyright-claim system is designed entirely on minimizing legal trouble.</p>
<p>Any effect it has on copyright infringement is purely secondary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because safe harbor (youtube isnt responsible for copyright claims like demonetizations, because theyre just a mailman). the copyright claim system is pretty much half manual by the copyright holder, and they cant just say &quot;you cant abuse this the community hates us for it&quot; because its the claimers copyright. Its pretty much impossible to sue youtube for these false claims because they're just facilitator in this case, but you can sue the copyright holder for fair use abuse, but it'll just be a waste of cash.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Bottom Line: It's not Theft, it's Fraud, and suing YouTube will get you nowhere.</p>
<p>A YouTuber's agreement with YouTube has several provisions which make suing YouTube a losing preposition, even if they win.I'm not a YouTuber, so I don't know what's actually in there... but I can give you some things with 99% Certainty.</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> An Arbitration Clause. This is basically Boiler-Plate in <em>every</em> agreement involving someone who can afford to pay for Arbitration. Arbitration is like a normal Suit, with Discovery and all other elements, except you don't go to a normal Court Room and have to pay the Arbitrator (Judge) for their time... as well as many other fees. This can <em>really</em> bleed a little guy dry, especially if the big guy resorts to delaying tactics.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> A clause giving them the right to remove videos from the platform at will, without reason. This is a CYOA (Cover Your Own Ass) Provision.</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> A clause wherein the YouTuber gives up their rights to sue YouTube over ad revenue lost as a result of YouTube's internal processes. This kind of provision isn't valid in some jurisdictions, but that doesn't matter because...</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> A Choice of Law Clause stating that the Contract shall be adjudicated under the laws of a state where all clauses would be binding.</p>
<p><strong>However</strong>, not all is lost. If the company running the Copyright Strike <em>is not</em> in fact the owner of the work they just hit... then they have committed a fraud that has taken money away from another person. The YouTuber can <em>theoretically</em> go after them for lost revenue.</p>
<p><em>However</em>... most of the time that's not going to be worth the effort. In general, under the United States Legal System, the victor only gets <em>Actual Damages</em>. They don't get their Attourney's Fees. Unless you have one of those insane Viral Videos where you got <em>millions</em> of views very quickly... the Ad Revenue stolen from you isn't going to be enough to make paying for a lawyer <em>worth it</em>. So actually Lawyering Up for your money is only a option if you've had a lot of Revenue redirected.</p>
<p>If someone actually does this... it's going to be really easy to get fair damages from a video with your Ad Revenue redirected. All you need is a third-party subpoena to YouTube to find out how much the other dudes got, and the judge knows how much to award if you win. If your video got taken down entirely... that's a bit more complicated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
