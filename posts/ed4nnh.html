		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it's developed specifically to bond well with the fibers of the cardboard. If you try to stick another type of tape, say duct tape to a cardboard box it wont stick very well because it doesn't entangle the box fibers very well. Because packaging tape essentially relies on those fibers to form a good bond, it doesn't bond well to surfaces that can't provide something similar to the fibers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It adheres well to paper because it's a starch based adhesive. A similar adhesive is used to bind the layers of paper in a box such as the outer wall, flutes, and inner wall of a single wall corrugated box. When you boil spaghetti you can throw it against the wall to determine if it's cooked enough because of the starch on the outside of noodle. It obviously isn't adhering very well to the wall though. It should adhere much better to paper, but the water could be an issue. </p>

I’ve bought multiple rolls from multiple brands and sometimes it smells gross as heck.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to sell specialty chemicals to Bostik, 3M, etc.  Every adhesive has a different chemical make up.  Duct tape has different chemicals in it than Scotch tape for example.  These formulations are designed to do different things.  Some adhesives, like packaging adhesives are pressure sensitive, meaning the harder you push on them, the better they should stick. </p>
<p>Depending on the chemical compound in the formulation, some chemicals will stick better to fibrous materials, some will stick to metal or rubber, some will stick to plastics.  Fluronated materials are exceptionally difficult to adhere to, for example, so you need specialty tapes for those materials. </p>
<p>These chemicals all have different smells as well.  Those smells are a combination of what chemicals are in the compound and how those formulations were cured (Heat, solvent, UV, etc).  </p>
<p>Lastly, depending on how the chemicals are cured and which are used, they will have different coloring.  Duct tape...the color doesn’t really matter.  Clear packaging tape it matters very much...the chemicals will need to be resistant to yellowing (the term for clear chemicals turning brown as they age or are subjected to the elements) in addition to having certain adhesive properties.  </p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
