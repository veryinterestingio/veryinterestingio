		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Farmers use a process called selective breeding. This is where they purposely pick the animals with the best traits and have them breed. Over hundreds of years this slowly changes the farm animals to have more favourable characteristics for the farmer.</p>
<p>So cows produce more milk, sheep produce more wool and chicken have more meat.</p>
<p>This works because animals are kept in farms and not in the wild. These new characteristics sacrifice traits that would allow the animal to survive in the wild and/or live long.</p>
<p>For example chickens in 1957 usually weighed around 0.9kg and now they weigh up to 4.2kg.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I keep sheep and can answer this. There are two types of sheep: hair sheep and wool sheep. Hair sheep produce a thick wool coat for winter, which they shed the following spring, just like many animals. In this regard, hair sheep are more like their natural ancestors. Wool sheep, on the other hand, are mutants bred to not shed their wool and to not produce hair. They CAN survive in the wild as individuals, but they would not be viable as a wild species.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On the whole mammals shed their hair. The hairs fall out individually and regrow individually. Some do it continuously, others seasonally with a shed of the winter coat in spring. And then the lighter weight summer coat is replaced in autumn. Horses in particular need a lot of brushing to help remove the old coat.</p>
<p>Humans selectively bred sheep from their wild ancestors for a number of characteristics and one of them was to not shed their hair/wool so easily. So instead of collecting the wool from random places (like the tree they rubbed themselves against) or some labour intensive brushing over the course of weeks, they could cut the fleece off in a single session.</p>
<p>There are other examples. The wild bird that chickens are descended from only lay an egg once a month, but modern layers are expected to lay an egg close to once a day.</p>
<p>Cows are used for milk because they produce a lot and have an easy ‘let down’ (leak milk quickly when most mammals only let down for their own offspring). </p>
<p>You can look at old pictures of farm animals and you can see they have over the last couple of centuries to have more muscle in areas that are popular cuts of meat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
