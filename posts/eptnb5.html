		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/Cromulus answered the where (carbon dioxide and water), here's the how.</p>
<p>Your muscles need energy to move. Very very roughly, your body makes this energy by breaking a molecule called ATP into ADP (ATP has a higher energy than ADP). Through a series of complex metabolic reactions, your body can leverage the breaking of ATP into ADP into muscle movement (along with a whole bunch of other things).</p>
<p>CO2 is produced when your body breaks down sugar to replenish ATP. Again this occurs by a set of complex metabolic reactions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</ul>
<p>Off the top of my head, I think that's what is going on. I don't think water is a rest product of the complete break down of FFA.</p>
<p>Googled the pathways for you to see them in more clear text (I know I suck, I didnt remember them from school):</p>
<p><strong>Beta Oxidation:</strong>  C<em>n</em>-acyl-CoA + FAD + NAD++ H2O + CoA → C<em>n</em>-2-acyl-CoA + FADH2 + NADH + H+ + acetyl-CoA</p>
<p><strong>Citric Acid Cycle:</strong> CH3C(=O)C(=O)O (pyruvate) + HSCoA + NAD+ → CH3C(=O)SCoA (acetyl-CoA)  + NADH + <strong>CO2</strong></p>
<p><em>Electron Transport Chain: At the mitochondrial inner membrane, electrons from NADH and FADH2 pass through the electron transport chain to oxygen, which is reduced to water.</em></p>
<p><del>EDIT: Read some answers that talk about water being a rest product. I think that's only glucose metabolism and maybe amino acids?</del></p>
<p><em>A fun thing to know about the ECT: You can uncouple it chemically and also enzymatically. It is how your brown adipose tissue works - it uncouples the ECT so that the H+ ions diffuse the membrane bypassing the ATP synthase complex and producing heat. There's also a byproduct or maybe it was a precursor? of TNT manufacturing called DNP which does the same, it was used as a highly successful and unsuccessful dieting pill back in the 60s(?). It causes fever which also caused some fatalities which in turn is why it is not sold anymore. You can of course still get a hold of it, but please don't - just don't. Seriously, don't.</em></p>
<p>For those chemically enclined you can see the similarities between DiNitroPhenol and TriNitroToluene.</p>
<p>EDIT: Forgot about the electron transport chain. Edits in the post are marked with italics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When people say 'burn', they mean break down. In simple words, fat is just sugar molecules (glucose) bound together in huuuge long strands. This is why fat (adipose) makes you a big person, because that's a lot of area to work with.</p>
<p>When you break it down, you are making energy, for your body to use. This is why exercising after a fast (like sleeping, hence break-fast) is a great way to burn fat. You have expended all your glucose while asleep, so your body needs to break down fat to get more glucose to use.</p>
<p>Now, your question is basically where does that glucose go? Since now we know it gets broken down to be used as glucose when needed.</p>
<p>The glucose - sugar - is used up and broken down to create ATP, which in simple words is body energy. To do anything in your body, you require ATP. This is why you have a recommended  calorie intake. This amount of calories a day is what you need for an average day due to breathing, walking, etc.</p>
<p>If you want to learn the science behind  breaking glucose into atp, just look up intro tutorials on learning a process called cellular respiration. It's a very simple process and you'll see that we make ATP and carbon dioxide. This is because glucose has a lot of carbon and oxygen in it, so it makes carbon dioxide from them, and the excess hydrogen goes to the ADP to make ATP (D means di=2, T means tri=3).</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR So basically, you burn fat to make energy and end up breathing out carbon dioxide.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
