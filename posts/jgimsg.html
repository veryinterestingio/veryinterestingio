I'm not down all day if I stand up too fast or sleep wrong, I just stretch and drink more water or some coffee and I'm fine. I'm asking why it is that adults get hurt or get muscle cramps/pulled muscles so easily, but kids are fine after a fall down the stairs or off their bike.</p></div></div>

Also like someone else said your height and weight have a lot to do with it. A heavier object hits the ground harder, and a taller object has more leverage.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Less mass hitting the ground at lower speeds = less damage potential. </p>
<p>Another factor that I haven't seen talked about is tension. Adults might tense up more reflexively. A rigid object hitting the floor will be more damaging than a limp object hitting the floor. Think of this like punching a wall vs. a big pile of jello. The wall is rigid and will accumulate the impact in the spot where you hit it. The jello will diffuse the impact by allowing the shock to spread. </p>
<p>You made the assumption that kids can fall and be fine and adults wouldn't be fine. This is an assumption, not fact. Your observations might reflect this, others might not. </p>
<p>Then the psychological factors come into play, adults might complain and focus more on the pain, generally believing themselves more prone to injury, while a child might not have that belief as of yet. </p>
<p>The wear-and-tear component is overblown here, more likely a combination of several factors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As for your situation, hard to say. I spent my whole childhood waking up crying if I slept wrong. Turns out some stuff at the base of my skull's pinched. How standing up makes you &quot;SOL,&quot; I don't know. POTS?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

He told me that their bones are more elastic in order to cope with their continuous and rapid growth. They are more sensitive if you pull them that's why many 2-4 year olds have their arm broken if you pull them hard, however they have an amazing tolerance when they fall</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
