		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With normal vision, an object from the world should focus to tight spot on the back of the eye, known as the retina. One way to check this is to shine a beam of light and see how big of a spot it is on the retina. Someone with bad but correctable vision would have a large spot rather than a tight one.</p>
<p>By adjusting the properties of the beam, you can modify it so that it bends similarly to how it would go through a glasses' lens. By figuring out the necessary changes in the beam to make a tight spot, it's possible to recover the lens refractive power needed to correct their eyes!</p>
<p>This method is more complicated and expensive than just swapping lenses and asking a if it's clearer. But it's definitely worth correcting major errors in a baby or young child's vision or else their brain will stop using the nerves from the eye, causing irreversible vision loss.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how when you go to the eye doctor, they have you look into a machine at a lighted picture of a hot air balloon (somehow it’s always the same picture), and it’s blurry at first and then it auto-adjusts to be clear? That machine automatically measures what kind of glasses you need. It works by measuring the light from the image that reflects back out of your eye, then adjusting the image until the reflected light bounces back properly in focus. Based on the adjustments it had to make, it can tell basically what prescription you need.</p>
<p>If someone can’t sit and look in the hot air balloon machine or can’t understand the directions to do it, the doctor can do the same kinds of measurements manually, by shining a light into the patient’s eye and looking at the reflection, then trying it with different lenses until the light focuses correctly.</p>
<p>When the eye doctor has you sit in the chair and look at an eye chart through lenses that they flip and ask you “One or two?”, they are trying to fine-tune the automatic number they already got from the hot air balloon machine. But the automatic number is already pretty good. If someone couldn’t help the doctor fine-tune any further, they could just use the automatic number.</p>
<p>For someone who can understand speech and communicate but may not be able to read or speak, there are eye charts that use shapes instead of letters, so that the person can point to the matching shape on a card instead of reading letters out loud.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is actually a relatively recent invention which allows this. It uses low intensity laser light that it shines through your eyes in order to determine the shape of the lens and how your eyes tries to naturally focus. This is far from accurate and is unable to determine many different type of vision defects but it is very quick and automatic. So you can issue prescription glasses to people who are unable to verbally speak or help with the examination in any way. Some shops are even installing these machines for use by their customers if they do not remember their prescription or think it have changed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was less than 2 years old when I got my first pair of glasses.  I think dad told me they did the laser light thing.  I was walking at the time.  After we got my glasses, I walked into a display table (forehead height to me at the time) because I wasn’t used to seeing things with my glasses yet...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is why it took years for my stepson to get the right glasses. He is autistic and was non verbal for a very long time. They were going off the puff test. He would always take his glasses off. Never wanted to wear them. Well we went to a new eye doctor and he figured it out. I guess there are two lenses in your eyes? The puff tests for the lens that just about everyone uses to see. For some reason my stepson uses the other lens. So they kept telling us he was far sighted when really he was near sighted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
