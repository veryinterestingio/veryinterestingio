		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The air, dust, and ash caused by the explosion is <em>very</em> hot, which means it's way less dense than the cooler air around it. Like a hot air balloon, the hot mixture gets pushed up above that cooler surrounding air and rises. The atmosphere gets thinner as you go up, so even though it's cooler up there it's less dense. Eventually, the atmosphere will be less dense than the hot explosion mixture, which means the mixture can't rise anymore. It hits this &quot;cap&quot; of thin air and spreads out. Think of it like releasing a big bunch of balloons in a room, and when they hit the ceiling the ones on the bottom push the ones on top out of the way.</p>
<p>The ground is also still <em>really</em> hot from the explosion so as cool air rushes in to fill the space left by the hot air it gets heated by the ground and gets pushed up, too. As it does, it carries more ash and dust with it, creating the thin column of the &quot;mushroom&quot;, squeezed inward by the cool air all around it.</p>
<p>That hot column of air keeps pushing up, forcing the hot gas mixture already up there out of the way. The mixture cools off, too, which makes it begin to sink back down a little. So hot column of stuff in the middle pushing up, which pushes the hot gasses out, and then down, to form the &quot;cap&quot; of the mushroom.</p>
<p>All explosions <em>kind</em> of do this, but they don't typically get hot enough to really show it. The layers of the atmosphere can be pretty distinct but they're still really deep, so it takes a big explosion to get the mixture of gasses hot enough to go all the way through the bottom layers and run into that really distinct line between two layers that makes the effect so pronounced.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The mushroom cloud isn't actually unique to nukes; any suitably large explosion will do it.</p>
<p>You basically just have a rising mass that's composed of hot air and debris, and as it rises cold air rushes in behind it from the sides. That cold air sort of pinches whatever heated/debris-laden air is left behind into a smaller stalk, hence the mushroom shape.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>Extreme</em> convection.</p>
<p>The bomb creates temperatures as hot as the inside of the sun, this heats the air up to about 100,000,000 degrees (no exaggeration)</p>
<p>This hot air is extremely low density compared to the normal air around the bomb site, so it will rise very well.</p>
<p>This makes the cold air push the hot air out of the way REALLY hard, so you end up with the vertical &quot;tube&quot; of smoke, the &quot;stalk&quot; of the mushroom cloud.</p>
<p>It stays as a tube because the pressure from the cold air around it is fairly uniform, so the pocket of hot air from the explosion punches a hole upwards.</p>
<p>This rising tube of hot air is mixing with colder air as it travels, slowing it down and increasing the density of it.</p>
<p>Remember: Air at high altitudes is already thinner and lower pressure than at sea level.</p>
<p>When the smoke tube/stalk grows high enough, the hot rising gases start to equal the density of the air around them and the rise stops. The tube/stalk continues to pump gasses/smoke into that area though, so the mushroom cloud forms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Explosion hot. Hot goes up. Pulls in cold from sides to fill space left by hot going up. Hot that went up spreads and starts to come down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
