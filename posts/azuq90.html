		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually when we talk about hyper computation we ignore runtime complexity. If we just look at what problems are decidable, we believe that no stronger model exists.</p>
<p>But if we look at runtime, quantum computation has (at least) a provable quadratic speedup over classical turing machines (grovers algorithm).</p>
<p>In the real world we are also not restricted to serial computation. Pi calculus captures parallel semantics and can also compute some problems faster than serial turing machines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two ideas here which should be treated separately. One is the distinction between things that can be computed by a Turing machine and things that cannot (i.e. those things that are formally undecidable). In that sense, there are a number of models that are stronger than Turing machines, as mentioned in other comments: this includes the Blum-Shub-Smale machine, also known as the &quot;real computer&quot;, that can operate on real numbers of unbounded precision in finite time. Another conceptually simple machine that is able to decide formally undecidable problems is a Turing machine equipped with an &quot;oracle&quot; for the halting problem (which I'll call Turing+HP): since the halting problem is formally undecidable, this is pretty intuitive. An interesting structure emerges from this construction: in fact, no Turing+HP machine can tell for all Turing+HP machines whether it will halt! But if you give a Turing+HP-halting problem oracle to a Turing+HP machine, you get an even stronger machine... we see a hierarchy of <em>levels</em> of undecidability! This level is referred to as Turing degree and the structure of the Turing degrees has been investigated by logicians. Collectively, computation beyond the Turing machine model is referred to as &quot;hypercomputation&quot;, and as also mentioned by other comments, we are not certain there are ways to hypercompute within the physical universe (but others studying the intersection of logic and relativity are having lots of fun (&quot;fun&quot;) bashing black holes and various structures of spacetime in which it may be possible).</p>
<p>Another distinct idea is a distinction between things that can be computed by a certain kind of machine in a polynomial number of operations and things that cannot (i.e. those things that are difficult for a particular kind of machine to compute). By kind of machine, I mean &quot;quantum computer&quot;, or &quot;nondeterministic computer&quot;. This is a very active area of research; in some sense humanity is somehow really bad at fully fleshing out what a particular kind of machine can do in polynomial time. For instance, we don't know for certain whether a quantum computer can do more in polynomial time than a computer that gets to flip coins. We also don't know for certain whether a computer that gets to flip coins can do more than a computer that does not. We suspect that quantum computers are better since there are some things they can do faster, e.g. searching N items in sqrt(N) time (but this does _not_ bring problems previously suspected to take exponential time into polynomial time). The famous example is P = NP: NP is roughly the set of problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a program that gets to run exponentially many copies of itself; somehow we <em>have not been able to prove</em> that this lets you solve problems &quot;faster&quot; than you could without forking! None of these models are able to do strictly more than an ordinary Turing machine, since the ordinary Turing machine can simulate all of these other models given exponential time. The big question is whether these models allow us to do something -- anything -- in polynomial time, that an ordinary Turing machine would require exponential time to do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no known physical process that could do hyper computation and solve problems that are undecideable. Solving NP-hard problems in P time is a different question though. We don't know if we just don't have the right algorithms to do it on a computer. Or if a quantum computer could do it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An interesting example of a machine much more powerful than the Turing Machine is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blum%E2%80%93Shub%E2%80%93Smale_machine" target="_blank">Blum–Shub–Smale machine</a>. Its power lies in its ability to work with real numbers, something that the Turing Machine can't truly emulate (you can compute, say, pi on a TM only up to a finite number of digits; a BSSM could compute the whole pi, in finite time). This allows it to solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time.</p>
<p>What is interesting about this is that the real world equivalent (or, better said, approximation - nothing equivalent to either BSSM nor TM can truly be constructed in real life) is the <em>analog computer</em> - a technology antiquated in favor of the TM-like digital computers! The reason for this is imprecision of real world technology. In order to reap the benefits of this model, our machine would need to be able to work with an infinite precision. If its results are only accurate up to a finite number of decimal places, we only really need to store those places, which a digital computer can do just fine, while being more resistant to noise and errors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
