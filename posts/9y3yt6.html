		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the typical honey bee hive, the workers decide when to make a new queen. The workers decide when the old queen is sick, weak, or the hive is too crowded and needs to be split. A queen starts off as a normal fertilized egg that would have turned into another worker. Often it's laid in a special honeycomb known as a queen cup. </p>
<p>The larva is fed a extra royal jelly, all workers larva get fed some royal jelly. The extra royal jelly turns it into a queen. Then typically the old queen and some of the older workers fly off to form a new hive in a process known as swarming. </p>
<p>Male bees are called drones, they come from unfertilized eggs, there are always a few around the hive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no king bee because a new queen only has to mate once to become fertile for life. </p>
<p>Male bees in a hive are called <em>drones</em> and serve no purpose except to join reproductive swarms in search of new queens that have just emerged. The males are actually born from haploid, unfertilized eggs.</p>
<p>A queen bee is born from a fertilized bee egg <em>just like worker bees</em>, he differences arise when the larval queen is fed special food (royal jelly) which causes it to grow larger than a worker bee and undergo the hormonal changes to become a queen. </p>
<p>when a hive is successful and it's time to breed and make new hives, the bees will construct special queen cells in the hive, the queen will lay an egg in each, and the workers will feed them royal jelly to make them mature into new queens. A new queen will emerge, she will murder any unhatched queens, then there will be a swarm where she and drones and a portion of the workers leave the hive, she mates with the drones and starts a new hive somewhere else.</p>
<p>worker bees can also revolt against a queen (such as if she is old or sick) by expanding a normal egg cell into a queen egg cell, feeding it royal jelly, and hoping the new queen murders the old one</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Then if the current Queen is performing like she should the hive will create a new one and evict the current one</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We call them queen but they serve the rest of the hive. The workers are the ones in charge. The queen is there only to ensure more sisters of the workers are born. She's a normal worker that gets a special diet when being formed, to become the reproductive organ of the hive. To accomplish this task, male drones (who are fatherless --they are formed from unfertilized eggs, unlike the workers and the queen) are created whose sole task is to mate with a queen, then they die. In the summer they have a huge party with drones from many hives congregating. Virgin Queens show up. Then the males mate with them, and in the process deposit their genitals onto the queen and die. The queen goes back to the hive where she serves her sisters for life, creating more and more sisters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>More interestingly, at the end of the bee year (maybe a month or two after midsummer), there is the great drone battle.
The hive has decided that their queen is good enough for another year and therefore all these fat drones that do nothing but eat are useless,
So, the workers drag (nearly) all the drones to the hive exit and kill them. In these days you can find handfulls of dead drones at the hive entrance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
