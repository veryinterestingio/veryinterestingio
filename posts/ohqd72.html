		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Real scientists, and the fictional ones in Jurassic Park, speculated on or predicted Dinosaur attributes and behavior, based on knowledge of modern reptiles and birds, and the features of fossilized dinosaur skeletons like the size and shape of orbital (eye socket) and nasal cavities and other features of the fossil record.  And, in Jurassic Park, the plot hinged in part on their predictions being partly wrong.</p>
<p>Edit: in fact, this is a major theme in Michael Crichton's writing, seen in this original book and others - we can't always predict accurately or know with certainty what is going to happen in response to our actions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The T-Rex's <em>prey</em> vision is based on movement.  It assumes that anything not moving is not edible.</p>
<p>The T-Rex can still see non-moving objects, of course.  It just assumes that they are not edible.  This tends to work because most prey will scatter when a predator gets too close.</p>
<p>It is a very simple, very fast algorithm, relatively easy to implement in bio-hardware.  (Google &quot;What the frog's eye tells the frog's brain.&quot; It is a classic paper in early neurology.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...how would scientists know...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They don't know for sure.  They are making an assumption.  But it is a very reasonable assumption, for many modern predators do the same.</p>
<p>EDIT: Wow, come back from lunch to find 400+ votes.  Thanks, everyone.  If you like it, I'll add some more:</p>
<p>The really interesting thing about the frog's eye paper is the observation that the visual processing was done in the eye.  Until that paper was published, everyone assumed that the optic nerve just transmitted an array of bits, and that all processing was done in the brain.  It turns out that the amphibian eye detected moving objects, and tagged them as such before sending the data to the brain.</p>
<p>That has evolutionary consequences.  When all of the processing is done in one place, a favorable mutation only has to occur in one place.  But when the visual processing is done partly in the eye and partly in the brain, a favorable mutation must occur in two places nearly simultaneously - and they must be compatible.  This is far less likely.  So it is very unlikely that such a visual system will evolve any further.</p>
<p>Thus scientists can make a reasonable guess that if such a visual processing system existed prior to the evolution of reptiles from amphibians, and it is very unlikely to change, then it will exist in all reptiles, including dinosaurs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the things Grant knows off hand in the movie (you are ALIVE when they start to eat you) were things he discovered in the book. For example they didn't know the Dilophasarus could spit venom at its prey until one of the workers was nearly blinded. Grant didn't know the T Rex couldn't see him when he didn't move until it had him dead to rights and it didn't eat him and Grant realized it was trying to get him to move because it had lost him. (though the Lost World novel retconned this)</p>
<p>The major theme of the novel was chaos, as in you couldn't predict what the animals would do, especially animals that had never been studied in a live environment. The book goes into this a lot more and I'd suggest reading it because, while I loved the movie, the book is much more insightful on the themes the movie only hinted at.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Navigating an environment and finding stuff to eat are different things. The implication in Jurassic Park is that its “I wanna eat that” vision is based on movement, not that its literally blind to everything that doesn’t move.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In The Lost World, the book - not the movie, they change that up.  T Rex has the ability to hunt with smell.  I believe Malcolm or someone reassesses the assumption that T Rex's vision is based on movement was a mistake.   The reason the T Rex in Jurassic Park had to rely on vision was because it's sense of smell was knocked out by a &quot;cold.&quot;  As you may recall, there is a storm in the first book/movie, and some of the dino's are sick. It's an interesting change-up in the book that isn't present in any of the films.</p>
<p>I think Crichton was very comfortable with the ebb and flow of scientific knowledge, and had some fun with changing our understanding and assumptions about T Rex's senses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
