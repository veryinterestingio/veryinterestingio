		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They did a study on this recently, and it turns out a variation of sleeping cycles is not only normal, but potentially a survival adaptation.  When studying hunter-gatherer tribes, they found that because of this, there was always someone awake in the tribe they were studying, protecting the entire tribe from attack.  </p>
<p>So no, it' not necessarily better.  Everyone has a slightly different rythm and that variation is actually a good thing in a hunter-gatherer tribe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We switched from regular 9-5 to an early morning and an afternoon/evening shift at my work due to covid.</p>
<p>I have always struggled to get to sleep before 2/3am regardless of when I go to bed. If I went to bed at 11/12 I'd be asleep by 2/4 and up at 8. Lying in bed doing nothing for multiple hours before finally falling asleep every night is damn torture, so I eventually stopped trying, might as well be productive if my body wont let me sleep yet.</p>
<p>So I demanded the evening shift, I go to bed at 3ish and I get up around 11. I can honestly say I've never slept better, it suits my body clock perfectly. I'm honestly not looking forward to the end of all this because it will mean going back to regular days.</p>
<p>Personally I think it's different from person to person, some things work for others that don't work for you. Me, I'm a night owl.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you're probably not doing it very often. </p>
<p>Quality of the sleep is determined by brain chemistry; brain releases chemicals that make us sleepy, or it doesn't. Lack of light, habits (including what time your dinner is, what's on TV and when, etc), etc all tie in to this - make brain decide when to make you aware and awake or sleepy. There's more noise during day, more light, more warmth, all your sensory organs are getting more signals, etc. So clearly brain is more overloaded and considers all this a possible threat or opportunity and keeps you awake.</p>
<p>But it doesn't mean you can't re-configure your body -- there's no night and day on ISS for example. People work night shifts all over the planet and still sleep normally, etc. Airline staff switches time zones constantly and still doesn't go mad. Astronauts on ISS see 16 sunrises and -sets (If I remember right) during time we know as single day. Brain has sort of priority system if it comes to sensory input: living in very loud city you might be okay with most of the noise and sleep well, but nursing mothers can instantly wake up to even quietest of noises a baby could make, even if they're horribly exhausted. Brain just decides that it's important enough and instantly wakes mothers up. That's also why many people find it hard to sleep while visiting someone - brain is way more alert than usual, because sounds, smells, geometry, everything's different.</p>
<p>So, if you train your body with different schedule and acceptable irritant level, sooner or later it'll become the norm. We all turn clocks twice a year and moan long and loud about messing with rhythm, but forget all about it in just a week or two. Only to start whinging again after half a year.</p>
<p>So your body doesn't really know the difference. It <em>feels</em> like it knows, but it's just a sum of all the other things™ and thus, looks like a grand, weirdly clever design of nature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
