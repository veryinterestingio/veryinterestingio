		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our eyes contain receptors sensitive to red, green, and blue light. There is some overlap between them at the edges of their sensitivity spectra. We see yellow when our red and green receptors are both stimulated. This can be caused by light wavelengths in between red and green stimulating both receptors, but a mix of red and green light will also stimulate both receptors. Hence RGB for light-emitting screens.</p>
<p>Paint and pigment is based on reflecting <em>and</em> absorbing light, rather than directly mixing light. This leads to different effects from mixing pigments vs mixing light. You're not only combining the reflected light bands, but also cancelling them out via absorbed light bands.</p>
<p>Edit: why yellow and blue make green.</p>
<p>Yellow paint reflects red and green light while absorbing blue. Blue paint reflects blue light while absorbing more red light than green light. Red-absorption from blue paint cancels out red-reflection from yellow paint, and blue-absorption from yellow paint cancels out blue-reflection from blue paint. Green-absorption from blue paint doesn't quite cancel out green-reflection from yellow paint, so the resulting paint mix is green. Replacing blue paint with cyan paint will result in a brighter green, since cyan paint mainly absorbs red while reflecting blue and green.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;By mixing red, green and blue (<strong><em>the additive primaries</em></strong>) in different combinations and at varying levels of intensity, we can simulate the full range of colors in nature. If the reflected light contains a mix of pure red, green, and blue light, the eye perceives white. When no light is present, the eye perceives black.</p>
<p>Combining two pure additive primaries produces a <strong>subtractive primary.</strong> The subtractive primaries of cyan, magenta, and yellow are the opposing colors to red, green, and blue.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The primary colors of light are red, green, and blue. That is because the human eye has receptors for those three colors. You can combine these colors of light to produce (nearly) any color of light that humans can see. </p>
<p>The <em>secondary</em> colors are cyan (green+blue), yellow (red+green), and magenta (red+blue). These are the &quot;primary pigments&quot; because pigments mix differently. Unlike light, which adds together, pigments <em>subtract</em>. So if you have cyan pigment, that means it <em>absorbs</em> red and <em>reflects</em> green and blue. If you have yellow pigment, it <em>absorbs</em> blue and <em>reflects</em> red and green. If you mix them together, you get a new pigment that absorbs <em>both</em> red and blue, so it only reflects green. That's why your art class lied to you and said yellow and blue make green. Really, yellow and <em>cyan</em> make green and only for pigments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Additive Vs Subtractive colors.</p>
<p>Light is essentially energy that vibrates at different rates, which we call frequencies. We call light that our eyes can perceive “visible light”.</p>
<p>There is also invisible light, like far ultraviolet and infrared. Some animals eyes are able to see a wider or more narrow spectrum of visible light. Like some can see heat the way we see light.</p>
<p>All light out there bouncing around the Universe is vibrating at real frequencies that can fall anywhere along a continuous range of numbers. Lets say blue is 200 and red is 1200 (I’m just making these numbers up for now). The important point is that light you see might be 805.3 or 288. Those numbers might be a purple or a green. There is a near infinite range of actual values of light between the two limits of what is visible to us.</p>
<p>Human eyes, however only have 3 different sensors in our eyes, called cones. (Some people have 4 but they’re rare-awesome weirdos) Our three common cones can see the blue (200), green (600), and red (1200) light. But they are clever and learned to work with each other. So if a red one says, “I see about 66% intensity”, green says “20%” and blue is “0%” our brains <em>construct</em> a color that is the blending of these three values. It <em>adds them</em> to make a fourth color that we think we see. (So-called color blind people just have one or more of their cones giving janky, off-kilter, or no values at all. So their eyes give their brains incomplete information to construct colors from.)</p>
<p>With the real, actual light sources out in the world, you can also take two or more different light emitting sources, like a red floodlight and a blue floodlight, and overlap their beams. The beams <em>add</em> their frequencies together and a third color is sensed by our eyes, which do their thing I mentioned earlier to show us that color.</p>
<p>The important thing here is that when you mix colored <em>lights</em>, the lights <em>add together</em> to make new colors. This is why we call mixing of pure light colors <em>additive color mixing</em>. The three primary colors of additive lights correspond to our cones wavelengths of sensitivity; red, green, and blue. If you add together all the various wavelengths of light together, you get pure white light. This is very important. <em>Additive colors ultimately result in white light.</em> Remember that! The primary colors of additive light are RGB because you can make any other color to us by mixing just those three colors. No others are necessary. That is not true for other additive colors than RGB.</p>
<p><em>Reflected colors</em> are an entirely different beast than pure light colors. Surfaces/materials will selectively reflect some color wavelengths of light back at our eyes while absorbing others. Our eyes see the colors of light that escape the surface.</p>
<p>So if you shine a white light at a surface that we think of as red, the surface is actually absorbing all the other wavelengths of light, allowing only red light to get back to our eyes.</p>
<p><em>Artists</em> developed <em>pigments</em> based on powdered minerals and other molecules that are very good at absorbing most of the wavelengths of white light, leaving for our eyes only very pure, specific colors of light for our eyes. An artist’s paint is just mineral in a suspension, like clear oil, so that it can be spread and then will stay put when it dries instead of falling away as powder again.</p>
<p>For example, powdered sulfur and cadmium are both very bright yellow pigments because they <em>absorb</em> all the other wavelengths of light except for yellow. A bright yellow paint can be made from them.</p>
<p>Something weird happens when you mix two pigments, like two colors of paint. The colors of light they reflect <em>don’t</em> add together like pure light. Instead, <em>the colors they absorb add together</em>. This means that if you start mixing pigments together like an artist mixing paints, <em>eventually they absorb all colors and you get black!</em> This is why pigments that result in reflected colors are called <em>subtractive colors</em> or <em>subtractive color mixing</em>.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the three pure, primary colors of pigments are red, yellow, and blue. We know these are the primaries because you can theoretically arrive at any other reflective color by mixing different values of those three. No other colors allow you to do this, which is why RYB are the subtractive primaries.</p>
<p>So to summarize: </p>
<p>RGB are the colors of light you can combine to arrive at pure white or any other visible color of light by mixing them. Because computer displays, TVs, stage lights, etc. all <em>project</em> light to transmit color information, they are governed by the rules of additive color mixing. </p>
<p>On the other hand, RYB are the colors of pigments that you can combine to absorb all the visible colors to arrive at pure black or any other visible color of reflected light by mixing them. Because paints, colored pencils, and any other matter that doesn’t emit light will instead selectively reflect and absorb its various wavelengths, the colors of this non-light “stuff” is governed by the rules of subtractive color mixing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the primary colors for painting are really cyan, yellow, and magenta. Blue, red and yellow happen to be close enough and common in nature, so I guess we picked those to put on our crayons and paint sets. The difference between painting/pigment primary colors and rgb primary colors is whether it's being used for direct or reflected light.</p>
<p>The way I understand it, the painting primary colors are the colors between red, blue and green on the color wheel. As in, painting primaries are actually what a computer rgb system would call secondary colors, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Red blue and green roughly match the peaks of the light spectrums that our 3 cones are sensitive to, and are used as primaries for direct light sources, such as tv and phone screens. But with reflected light like what you see when you shine white light on a painting, the way they combine is the opposite, so the non-rgb colors are primary for paints.</p>
<p>I think the colors add something like this:</p>
<p>Direct Light: </p>
<p>Red+green = yellow (traffic lights actually have good color spacing)</p>
<p>Reflected Light (paint pigments):</p>
<p>Yellow (absorbs blue, reflects red and green which we see as yellow) + cyan (absorbs red, reflects blue and green which we see as cyan)= green (yellow paint absorbed all blue, cyan paint absorbed all red, so only green is left to be reflected)</p>
<p>Remember that with paint (and most non glowing objects), the color you see is only the wavelengths that are <em>reflected</em> by that pigment, while all other rainbow colors are absorbed. This is why green plants die if you put them under a green lamp, because green is the only color they <em>can't</em> absorb.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
