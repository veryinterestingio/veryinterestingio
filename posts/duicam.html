<p>I might have this slightly wrong as it's been a couple of years but birth control isn't just estrogen, it's <del>high</del> *correction low* amounts of estrogen (and progesterone) which can trick your body into thinking it's pregnant so that it doesn't ovulate.</p>
<p><del>The reason this &quot;tricks&quot; your body is that when you are pregnant large amounts of estrogen and progesterone are released and if the concentrations are high enough then the ovaries don't do things like develop the follicle that will become the ovum (egg).</del></p>
<blockquote>
<p>when taking in small amounts it has a paradoxical effect of inhibiting that LH spike/ovulation. It’s a pretty unique phenomenon that doesn’t really happen with other feedback systems in the body.</p>

<p>While it is definitely more complex than this, this is my simplification.</p>
<p>Edit: this is memory from my bio 30IB class that I haven't been in since early 2015. I am not a doctor nor am I likely to be remembering this correctly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pharmacology student here, not an expert at all but in simple terms  birth control is made up of synthetic estrogen and a synthetic testosterone like compound called progestin, the ratio of estrogen to progestin used in the birth control you’re taking influences the way it works and side effects. </p>
<p>Estrogen in the birth control stops ovulation by preventing your body from making something called a dominant follicle when that dominant follicle does not mature the estrogen hormones in your body stays at a consistent level and cannot reach a peak amount. If that peak level of estrogen is reached, it signals the body to trigger a process called “LH surge”—LH stands for the hormone luteinizing hormone. The LH surge is what is responsible for ovulation, when the ovaries releases eggs. If your body does not have enough estrogen to reach peak levels to produce the LH surge, ovulation does not happen and if ovulation does not happen there is no egg to fertilize. </p>
<p>Progestin works like this, it can also stop the LH surge but it also changes the lining of the uterus to make it less favorable for the egg to implant, progestin can also make the cervix mucus very thick so sperm can’t easily penetrate through to get to the opening of the uterus, the cervix is the opening to the uterus. </p>
<p>These 2 hormones do a lot more and it gets even more in depth but that would be too long to explain without getting more scientific/medical and be too long to read.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of things in your body are regulated by what's called negative feedback and so are the female (and male) sex hormones. This means that during a normal female sexual cycle, a hormone called follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is released by the brain which causes the female egg to develop inside the ovaries. Simultaneously, FSH causes the cells surrounding the female egg to produce estrogen and this is the major source of estrogen in the female body. This estrogen goes back to the brain and inhibits the release of further FSH (this is negative feedback) to prevent the development of more than one egg. Eventually, this one, developed egg will be released into the female reproductive tract where it can get fertilised by a male sperm. When you take large amounts of exogenous estrogen, it goes to the brain and inhibits the release of FSH (and another hormone called LH which is necessary for ovulation i.e the release of egg into the female reproductive tract). This, again, is negative feedback but this time the estrogen is not coming from a developing egg but from the birth-control pill you took. When FSH and LH levels fall, no egg can develop and get released into the reproductive tract respectively. And thus, there will be no egg for the sperm to fertilise and no pregnancy can occur.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
