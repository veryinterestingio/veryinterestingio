		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The color of the leaves depend on a few factors. One is the type of tree. Different trees contain different chemicals, which react differently. Another big component is the weather. New England is great for &quot;leaf peeping&quot; as they call it because the temperature swings so much in the fall. It is not uncommon to have a 75F degree day but at night it gets down to 50F. This temperature swing activates the chemicals in the tree. The tree gets the signal to prepare for winter, so it stops pumping out chlorophyll, which is what makes the leaves green. (Edit: others have pointed out below that I didn't explain this part. The shortening of days means less sunlight, which is the signal to the tree to prepare for winter. The tree seals off the leaves from the rest of the tree to winterize, which causes the chlorophyll production to stop, and the chlorophyll in the leaves breaks down). The lack of chlorophyll in the leaves allows the other colors to come out, and the colder the night temperatures the better the color, as long as you don't get frost. (Edit: this is because cooler weather causes the production of more anthocyanins, which is where those deep reds come from) Since New England will get a solid month or so of these temperature swings beginning in September, the result is a brightly colored forest around early October.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It isn't everywhere in the U.S. The really impressive colors are in New England and the northern Midwest. It's just a combination of climate, the degree of how forested it is, and the variety of species there. For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_saccharum" target="_blank">sugar maple</a> turns very vivid red, and it's only native to North America.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I live in the blue ridge mountains and we're supposed to have great colors this year. It has to do with the types of trees that are native to this area and the weather that year. Trees need to have low enough temperatures to stop making chlorophyll and reveal beautiful colors. Too late in the year or too cold or too moist or too dry and they just shrivel and fall off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
