		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you enter the same password every time it is required (if you use the same password for everything, which most people do), eventually it becomes part of your muscle memory, where you don't even have to think about what you are typing, you just do it because you have learned that it will get you to where you want to be (logged into whatever program/website required the password).</p>
<p>Because of this, pretty much the only time you really think about what your password is was when you created it initially, which for most people was several years ago, which is why it can be hard to remember when you aren't actively typing it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer is muscle memory vs. recall memory.</p>
<p>Longer answer is that it uses a different part of the brain than things like retrieving traditional facts and memories, so the process to retrieve it is different.</p>
<p>Additional side note is that you should be changing your password much more often than every few years. (Also, use a password manager.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because different parts of brain do different things. Most of the brain is actually for uncontious tasks and we (our conciousnes) don’t have direct access to it.</p>
<p>By doing something over and over brain optimizes the computations required by moving it into the uncoucious parts of brain so you can focus on different things.</p>
<p>Like when you start to drive a car you almost can’t focus on anything else and it’s hard to maintain a conversation with somebody, but after time you don’t think about it.</p>
<p>By typing a password daily, brain will just remember the mechanical movement required to type it. It does not need the text value for that purpose so you can easily forget it.</p>
<p>Sometimes it helps to type the password on the same keyboard as usually to remember.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Its in my reflex memory, automatically I type it,, but if I have to write it some where, I will have to check it from my browser security settings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
