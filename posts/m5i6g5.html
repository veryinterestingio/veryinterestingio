		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Last week was British Science Week! We are here to answer any questions any of you have to do with science or technology and how they affect your life. There are no silly questions - ask us anything and we will try to give an easy-to-understand answer and, wherever possible, provide some further sources to enable you to do your own research/reading.</p>
<p>Our goal is simply to advance everyone's understanding of science, engineering and technology and to help people be better informed about the issues likely to affect them and their families.</p>
<p><strong>More info / Longer read:</strong> CSES is a registered charity in the UK, founded in 1920. We're a volunteer group of over 250 members and our key strength is our diversity and interdisciplinary expertise. Our members come from a variety of educational, social and economic backgrounds, from industry and academia and a multitude of age groups, representing groups from the millennials all the way to the Silent Generation (our oldest member being 97)!</p>
<p>There has been growing dis-information globally in the last 20 years. Today's global interconnectedness, while being hugely beneficial for making information easily accessible to everyone, has made it ever more difficult to determine 'truth' and who to trust. As an independent charity, not affiliated or biased to any particular group, but with broad knowledge we are here to answer any questions you may have and to hopefully point you to further reading!</p>
<p>Our goal is simply to answer as many of your questions as we can - but we aren't able to give advice on things - sorry! We will also be clear where what we are saying is the experience-based opinion of someone in our team.</p>
<p>CSES will draw from its large pool of volunteers to answer your questions, however the people standing by to answer comments are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vic Leverett OBE: 40 years' engineering experience with previous director-level positions Europe's largest defence/engineering companies. Honoured by The Queen with an OBE for services to engineering and defence.</li>
<li>Professor David Humber: 30 years' experience as a researcher, lecturer and senior university manager specialising in immuno-biology and the life sciences.</li>
<li>David Whyte: Technologist and Chartered Engineer with 10 years' Research and Deployment experience and 15 international patents across a wide range of technologies.</li>
<li>Amy Knight: Science teacher and artist experienced in art/science collaborations with organisations like Soapbox Science and The Royal Society; her work has been featured at the Tate Modern's &quot;Tate Exchange&quot;.</li>
<li>Anthony McQuiggan: 10 years of engineering experience and 30 years as a serial entrepreneur having built a number of very successful start-up SME technology companies in the UK, Japan and the USA.</li>
<li>Roger Pittock: 36 years' experience in electronics, software, mechanical, electrical, process engineering, and safety systems. Avid supporter of the Consumers' Association, currently serving on their Council.</li>
<li>Adam Wood - President of CSES: Chartered Engineer with over 12 years' experience in electronics, software and systems engineering, working in the medical / healthcare, transport and aerospace industries.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thank you all for doing this AMA!</p>
<p>I'm a high school student and in Biology class we are currently discussing evolution. I think this subject is very interesting but one particular thing got me wondering.</p>
<p>From what I've learned, evolution occurs through 'survival of the fittest'. Organisms mutate and when, by coincidence, a mutation occurs that's beneficial for that organism, the organisms with that mutation will be more likely to survive and pass on their genes to further generations.</p>
<p>However, I read online that microevolutions (we don't discuss this in school) can and have occured, even in humans. An example is that more and more babies in modern society are born without or with less wisdom teeth and have smaller jaws. </p>
<p>How is this possible? If a human rarely dies due to wisdom teeth or jaw size related issues, how is it possible that having the genes which lead to less wisdom teeth or smaller jaws are getting more and more common?</p>
<p>Edit: spelling</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I want to Ask about Neural Interfaces Technology and Also ask if Quantum Computing can actually make a difference for that type of Technology.</p>
<p>1- are we considered in the early stages of Neural Interface Technology or have been slow due to the available technology to use for Neural interfaces</p>
<p><em>(if my memory is correct, the research for neural interfaces has started in the 70’s and I noticed it advanced a lot but still, I think the investment in that technology isn’t always happening and also, the processing of the Brain signals to turn into Electromagnetic signals in order to turn into data for the NI using device and it usually is slow and the response times look slow)</em></p>
<p>2- now since my question here is usually for the response times of Neural Interfaces... will Quantum computing be actually effective when we use Neural interface technology? and make the Robotic and slow response times slowly fade since (if I understood how it works correctly) it makes the calculations on an Atomic and Subatomic levels and supposedly processes the information much faster?</p>
<p>I’ll be honest, if the articles I find about Quantum Computing aren’t just media hyping people up and it’s true that it would make response times very unnoticeable... that would probably be a really good start in advancing Neural Interface prosthetics for example, We would control many devices without direct connection to the brain since the brain is a very sensitive part and unnecessary and direct contact
to the brain would probably be too risky.</p>
<p>3- now since all the questions regarding what would Quantum computing and Neural interfaces achieve are out of the way... is it ever safe if we implant these devices or use them for big amounts of time?</p>
<p>Like if we Hypothese that we planted RFID chips for example connected to a small device that does use both mentioned technologies and we planted it in someone’s arm (putting in mind it’s used with a rechargeable battery or DC Battery) and they use this device as a remote control for various devices whether portable or inside their homes (even if it’s their vehicle)... how dangerous an idea like this would be regarding well-being of the user (regardless to the battery)?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for putting time to answer my questions🙏🏻</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
