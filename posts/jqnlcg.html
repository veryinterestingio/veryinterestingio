When you learn something new, new connections between nerve cells are formed. Over time synapses that aren't used deteriorate and make space for new ones and the information they held is forgotten. So basically you always forget unimportant stuff you don't need anymore to be able to remember new information.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;... the brain’s memory storage capacity to something closer to around 2.5 petabytes (or a million gigabytes). For comparison, if your brain worked like a digital video recorder in a television, 2.5  petabytes would be enough to hold three million hours of TV shows. You  would have to leave the TV running continuously for more than 300 years  to use up all that storage.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nerve cell is kinda like a dumpling that with noodles. One neuron has long nudles and a short ones The long one is called axon and the short one is called dendrite. Typically neuron has many short noodles. When we learn something these short noodles grow something like small thorns on them. If we learn smth very complex the thorns can be much bigger and not look like thorns at all. They can look like truffles or other mushrooms. These truffles have proteins inside that we call engrams. When we dont use some knowledge these proteins break down and thorns shrink. This is how we make room for new material. So the memory capacity is not infinite, its plastic. We can learn and forget.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very simplified, the energy costs to sustaining the synapses of a &quot;full&quot; brain would be ludicrous, so our system is kind of set up such that filling the brain is impossible.</p>
<p>But very hypothetically? All of your cognitive processing relies on the process of acquiring, processing, and storing information, so you'd probably just be a vegetable.</p>
<p>Wow, that's a lot of uses of the word &quot;process.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
