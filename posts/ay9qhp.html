		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason that the aurora is seen in so many colors is that our atmosphere is made up of many different compounds like Oxygen and Nitrogen. When the charged particles that come from the sun hit the atoms and molecules of the Earth's atmosphere, they excite those atoms, giving off light. Different atoms give off different colors of the spectrum when they are excited. A familiar example is the Neon lights that we see on many business signs in our modern world. The Neon lights contain the gas Neon. These lights have electricity run through them to excite the Neon gas. When the Neon is excited, it gives off a brilliant red-orange color. The Neon lights are the same idea as the aurora, only on a lot smaller scale.</p>
<p>Different gases give off different colors when they are excited. Oxygen at about 60 miles up gives off the familiar yellow-green color, Oxygen at higher altitudes (about 200 miles above us) gives the all red auroras. Ionic Nitrogen produces the blue light and neutral Nitrogen gives off the red-puple and the rippled edges. Imagine if the atmosphere were made of Neon gas and Sodium gas. We would see red-orange and yellow auroras!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm an aurora physicist. The colors of the aurora that you typically can see with your naked eye are green and red. On rare occasions, you can see blue and a purplish-red as well, but typically only during very intense storms. </p>
<p>Un-edited photographs will show off the colors better. It should be noted that many of the colors you see in photographs are there because the color sliders have been tweaked, not because those colors actually occur. The main body of the aurora will almost always be green, not the greenish-blue color that a lot of photoshoppers use to bring out the other colors.</p>
<p>The two main constituents of our atmosphere that produce the colors are atomic Oxygen (O) and Nitrogen (N). Because of quantum mechanics that I won't get too deep into, atoms tend to fluoresce at very particular wavelengths when exposed to energy. When energy from the solar wind enters from Earth's magnetosphere at high latitudes, it excites those O and N atoms. </p>
<p>Because Oxygen is far more dense than Nitrogen at high altitudes, we see the green and red even during the weaker magnetic events. The green emission occurs between 100 and 130 km, usually, while the red emission comes from between 220 and 280 km. </p>
<p>The reason for this altitude separation is due to the energy of the precipitating particles. While both red and green emissions come from Oxygen, the amount of energy that is being put into each individual particle is different. The higher a particle's energy, the deeper that particle can penetrate into Earth's atmosphere before losing all its energy. So, higher-energy particles go deeper into the atmosphere (lower altitude) and produce the green emission. Softer particles get stopped at higher altitudes and produce the red emission.</p>
<p>During all of this, the Nitrogen is getting excited at lower altitudes as well. However, because there are simply fewer Nitrogen particles, the intensity of the blue/purple emissions are much lower than we can see, except during the most intense magnetic events. Long-exposure cameras with filters can capture this.</p>
<p>The auroras I've discussed above are due to collisions with electrons, which are the most abundant particles precipitating into the lower atmosphere. However, protons can also precipitate (the solar wind is a bunch of individual protons and electrons). These will produce a different color of aurora that is generally quite weak and only visible to very specialized filtered cameras. It's sort of bluish-green.</p>
<p><a href="http://optics.gi.alaska.edu/realtime/data/PKR_DMSP/Keo_15hr/Keo_15hr/2013/PKR_Keo_15hr_2013-12-08.png" target="_blank">Here</a> is a link an example of a &quot;keogram&quot; plot from the University of Alaska Fairbanks. I've actually published quite a lot of analysis on this particular night.</p>
<p>From top to bottom you have: Green Oxygen line (5577-angstrom wavelength), Blue Nitrogen (4278), Proton Aurora (4861), and Red Oxygen line (6300). </p>
<p>Note that the scales are different. Green looks weaker than red here, but the scale differs by a factor of 10 (I didn't make these plots!). The scale between green and blue is also a factor of 10 different; however, blue <em>still</em> looks weaker than green. That is a good illustration of just how much more intense the green emission usually is than everything else. You can see that the green and blue do follow roughly the same patterns, though, which is indicative that they occur due to the same precipitation effects. Oxygen is just so much more dense than Nitrogen that it dominates.</p>
<p>This night was particularly interesting for how much red emission was produced. It was ideal for my science, which was looking at the region near 250 km, where the red emission occurs. The precipitation energies on this night were fairly weak, which produced lots of emissions at higher altitudes. The proton aurora was also pretty intense, relatively speaking. You don't usually see so much of it.</p>
<p>TLDR: The aurora doesn't &quot;change colors&quot; in an exact sense. Red aurora is not the same aurora as green aurora. It's different atoms at different altitudes being exposed to different energetic conditions. The aurora isn't a singular thing; rather, it's an amalgamation of a whole bunch of different constituents and conditions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Atoms when excited will drop electrons down energy levels to release protons. Depending on the energy level it will release photos at different frequencies. I image some of these frequencies are on the visual spectrum and that is what you are seeing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
