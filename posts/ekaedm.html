		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The term was made up to describe a problem with trying to negotiate with a country that has an elected legislature and high turnover -- I believe the original example was Turkey, in the earliest years of their democracy. Who do you even call to negotiate <em>with,</em> when whoever you call might not even be there two years later?</p>
<p>The answer? The bureaucracy. All of the mid-level management who stay in the same jobs in the foreign ministry, the defense department, and so on even when the legislature changes hands, the people who work one level down from the political appointees. And because they're below the &quot;surface&quot; of the democracy, they defined them as the &quot;deep&quot; state, as opposed to the &quot;surface&quot; or elected state. <em>In its original usage, it wasn't necessarily sinister.</em></p>
<p>But it rapidly came to be interpreted in sinister ways, because narrow interest groups have always complained that when their coalition or party gets elected, having promised them the moon and the stars, they do not get the moon and the stars. And sometimes it is, in fact, because elected politicians went to the department of whatever and the department of whatever said, &quot;we physically, literally cannot give them the moon and the stars&quot; or &quot;it's illegal for us to give them the moon and the stars&quot; or &quot;we can, but it'll cost a billion trillion dollars and take a hundred years.&quot; And usually, if they say that, it's because it's true. But whether it's true or not, the politician then goes back to his voters and says, &quot;I promised you the moon and the stars, and having voted for it and won, you deserve the moon and the stars, but I was stopped from giving them to you by those unelected 'elites' in 'the Deep State.'&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Canadian example:</p>
<p>Trudeau is the leader of Canada, and gets his power from the people voting for him.</p>
<p>The Commissioner of the RCMP, the Director of CSIS, the President of CBSA (and the list goes on), are not elected and instead appointed.</p>
<p>Deep State is a term used to describe power structures maintained by unelected, unappointed people within the government.  If a deep State did exist, it would likely be made up of a small group of highly ranked employees who could subvert or influence policy decisions without the public's knowledge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>FDR didn't order the oil embargo that led to war with japan. No elected official did. No one responsible to the American people made the decision that led to us going to war.  Thats a fact,  aaaaaaaand that's why people say theres a deep state</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
