		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I live next to Coors field, and every game there's like 30-50 scalpers out front selling and buying tickets. 90% of the scalpers end up with tickets they can't get rid of. How the hell can that be profitable if you end up holding hundreds of dollars in tickets every game? The people scalping these tickets do not make enough to cover a single leftover ticket once a week, let alone 10-20 every single game. The entire things seems fishy as hell. Do they work for Coors field or ticket Master or something? That seems to be the only thing that makes sense.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I got in a conversation with a scalper once and he told me he’d buy the minimum number of tickets to get the “group” rate (~10-15 continuous tickets) for games he thought would be popular which were discounted 50-66% depending on the section, then he could sell them at a 0%-50% discount from face value depending on the time before the game and still make some money as long as he sold at least 50% of the tickets he had originally bought.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Maybe they are season ticket holders,  maybe a friend canceled at the last minute, whatever.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is why lots of major pro sport stadiums and concert venues are going mobile only tickets that have barcodes that change every minute. Cannot screenshot it and send it to people because it expires. You can send the ticket to another account or sell it on the app’s approved exchange. The hassle to do this while walking into the event will definitely hinder some people from selling their tickets to scalpers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
