In either case, how does a potato actually make use of the starchy substance?</p></div></div>

It’s just a polysaccharide that is metabolized when needed to grow new shoots. The starch is stored in the potato cells which, yes, are alive.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The starch storage cells are part of the larger amyloplast cell category (energy storage cells, that’s all). They store energy in the form of sugar or fats, depending on the kind, so that the plant has back up energy in case of an emergency where photosynthesis doesn’t cover all of its energy needs. For example, if the plant is consistently caught in cloudy/ low light conditions. </p>
<p>These starch cells are alive, they simply have amyloplasts instead of chloroplasts (which are found in green, photosynthesizing cells). Amyloplasts can be converted into other kind of plastids too, like chromoplasts and chloroplasts given the right conditions. It’s actually pretty incredible. </p>
<p>The starch is metabolically converted to usable energy through a long series of interconnected metabolic processes.  It’s fairly complicated but there are people who can explain it fairly well both in textbooks and on YouTube. </p>
<p>Great question! :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding to the many good answers already in this thread, it should be noted that every potato you have ever eaten is a <em>cultivar.</em> The tubers of modern potatoes grown for consumption are much, much larger than those of their wild ancestors, a product of centuries of selective breeding.</p>
<p>Thus in some sense, the “function” of a potato plant’s tubers is to feed people, as they have been deliberately engineered for that purpose. Sure, wild potatoes and many other plants also have tubers, but selection factors in the wild are very different from those in greenhouses, so it cannot just be assumed that the tubers of cultivated potatoes are completely identical in composition and behavior to those of wild plants.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Starch, itself, is a chemical and is not alive. It is stored by the potato within cells that are alive. Starch is an energy store. A potato is a tuber, which is a modified underground stem. It is how the plant overwinters. In the spring the starch is used to enable the potato to germinate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
