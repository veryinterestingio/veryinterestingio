		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of comments didn’t do that great a job at explaining it so I’ll take a crack at it. When a large moving body of warm air meets a large moving body of cold air and the warm air happens to slide below the cold air, the warm air wants to rise. Similarly to how hot air balloons work, warm air wants to go up and called her ear naturally wants to go down.  When air moves up rapidly on one side and down on one side then the air can start to form a vortex. For a more intuitive understanding of how this happens you can try sliding your hands past each other while leaving a small gap in between them in a container filled with water. If these forces are strong enough than the vortex may spiral into a tornado and right itself to that the axis of rotation is vertical because an updraft (wind moving straight up) can cause them to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A normal thunderstorm requires an instability (e.g. cool air at high altitudes, warm air at the surface), moisture, and lift (something to trigger the instability). </p>
<p>This kind of storm gets big, rains vigorously and creates a pool of cool air at the surface that prevents air from flowing into the storm and the storm dies. This won't make a tornado. </p>
<p>Now take the same storm setup (instability, moisture, lift) and have a strong wind that changes direction throughout the lowest kilometer of the atmosphere (wind shear). When the storm initiates in this environment it will be rotating and called a &quot;supercell&quot; thunderstorm. One of the big features of these storms are near surface rotation and the rain falls away from the updraft allowing these to be long lived storms. </p>
<p>This isn't enough to guarantee a tornado and I'm not sure we know exactly what is the sufficient process but I am about a decade behind the literature on the subject. That aside, the thinking is that the environment the storm is ingesting into it's updraft needs to have horizontal vorticity. Additionaly the rear flank downdraft may play a role in helping turn that horizontal vorticity into vertical, bringing it down to the surface before it turns upward (as inflow enters the updraft) and is vertically stretched in the updraft. </p>
<p>This gets into conservation of angular momentum, put picture a figure skater spinning. When they hold the arms wide they are slow, and when they pull thier arms close to thier body the spin faster. Same thing with rotating air in the inflow, it gets pulled tighter and rotates faster. </p>
<p>This near surface rotation can manifest as a tornado. This is the type of tornado that would have caused the damage in the article. </p>
<p>There are other kinds of tornadoes (landspouts and waterspouts) but they are not typically things that cause damage and are not associated with storms. </p>
<p>I know this got a bit away from ELI5, but the processes at work are fairly complicated and I have grossly simplified it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the key thing missing from the other explanations is the <em>convection cap</em>, which is a layer of warm, dry air that gets between the other two layers.</p>
<p>Cool air is more dense and will tend to drop down. Warm air and humid air are less dense and will tend to rise up. When a cool weather front collides with a warm, humid front, the cool front will shove the warm front up and over. The humidity rapidly condenses and forms rain.</p>
<p>Tornadoes happen when there's another weather front that is warm and dry gets between the other two. It prevents the other fronts from mixing, forming a &quot;cap&quot; or lid over the warm, humid front that's near the ground. The cool air above continues to cool off and get more and more dense, and heavier, and squeezes down on the air near the ground. The warm, humid air near the ground has nowhere to go. The convection cap is trapping it so it can't go up, and cool air will &quot;spill&quot; around the convection cap so the humid air can't escape outward.</p>
<p>Pressure keeps building and building as the cold air squishes the humid air, until a hole forms in the convection cap. Suddenly, the humid air has a place to escape the increasing pressure. It's like pulling the plug in a sink or drain, except upside down. The air is already moving around, and that momentum gets conserved so the air around the hole swirls around rapidly, just like around a drain. With the humid air <em>finally</em> moving out of the way of the cold air, the cold air will spill in from around the convection cap, pushing the humid air in towards the hole, making the humid air &quot;drain&quot; through the hole even faster. The force of the humid air moving through the convection cap can widen the hole, allowing the humid air to move even faster, creating a stronger force and stronger rotation, making a stronger tornado.</p>
<p>The force of the tornado depends on how big the weather fronts are and a whole bunch of other chaotic factors. Tornadoes are common in the United States because of the unique geography. Cold, dry air sweeps down from Canada, guided by the Rocky Mountains to the west so that the weather front moves more towards the Gulf of Mexico. Hot, dry air comes from the Mojave desert around Nevada, New Mexico, and Arizona. Warm, humid air comes up from the Gulf, somewhat guided by the Appalachian Mountains. These three weather fronts collide throughout the American midwest in what is commonly called Tornado Alley.</p>
<p>Although tornadoes are <em>possible</em> all over the world, the geography around the world just doesn't create the same conditions that make them common in the United States. That geography doesn't exist at the same large scales that it does in the US.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since others have already posted pretty detailed explanations, I'll go more along the ELI5 route and do some simplifying.</p>
<p>Warm air is lighter (less dense) than cold air. Think of a hot air balloon - the air in the balloon is warmer than the surrounding air, so the hot air balloon rises. A good environment for tornadoes has very warm air near the ground and cold air up in the atmosphere. That warm air wants to rise. It's usually held down by a very warm layer of air called the &quot;cap&quot;. At some point, the cap &quot;breaks&quot;, and that warm air rushes up into the atmosphere really fast and with great force - that's an updraft. That's what causes thunderstorms. But where does the rotation come from? Sometimes, there's a big difference in wind speed and direction between the air near the ground and the air up in the atmosphere. That difference causes rotation along the horizontal axis. When that horizontal rotation gets caught in our updraft, it turns into rotation along the vertical axis, so we get a rotating updraft. And when that rotating updraft reaches all the way to the ground, that's our tornado!</p>
<p>I know I skimmed over things but I tried to keep it simple.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
