		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By definition, yes, one of the criteria for something to be designated a planet is that it must have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium (i.e., it's nearly spherical) per the IAU, e.g. <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/in-depth/" target="_blank">this discussion from NASA</a> or the actual text from the <a href="https://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/Resolution_GA26-5-6.pdf" target="_blank">IAU</a>. As implied in the wording, reaching this condition is (generally) a function of the size of the object, so we expect that large objects would have reached hydrostatic equilibrium and be nearly spherical. The upper limit for the size of an object before it is expected to reach hydrostatic equilibrium depends on a few factors, but objects like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Juno" target="_blank">Juno</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_Eunomia" target="_blank">Eunomia</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iapetus_(moon\)" target="_blank">Iapetus</a> are good examples of about as large as something can get (at least based on the examples in our solar system) and still be an irregular shape, though mass, density, and material properties all play a role so it's hard to define a single criteria (i.e., we can't say objects with a mass &gt; X, or diameters &gt; X should be in hydrostatic equilibrium, etc). Dwarf planets, like Pluto and Ceres, have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium but have not cleared their orbits (one of the other criteria for being called a planet). Planetary geology is admittedly not my specialty, so I'll defer to anyone with a more nuanced understanding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some really good, detailed explanations elsewhere in the comments. There are also some basic responses that don't really answer your question entirely.</p>
<p>So let me sum it up for a TL;DR:</p>
<p>The shape of the object does not affect its orbit in anyway (see ISS). However, any large, naturally occurring object (e.g. a planet) will have to be more-or-less spherical because of its own gravity pulling towards its own center.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Extraneous fun fact: planets, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition_of_planet" target="_blank">by definition</a>, have to be pretty much spherical.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

</blockquote>
<p>That's not a thing.</p>
<p>Something could be any shape  and  still orbit  around a  sun  or other mass.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>E.g.  the   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station" target="_blank">International Space Station</a>  is an  odd shape and orbits around the Earth. </p>
<p>We've  designed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_habitat" target="_blank">much bigger space stations</a> that would orbit with no problems,  etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Donut/Toroid shaped planets are technically possible, if their centrifugal force can overcome the force of gravity (i.e. if they spin fast enough relative to their size), but technically possible doesn't mean they actually exist, and it definitely wouldn't affect their ability to orbit a sun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You actually have the causality backwards. Something as big as a planet must always be (approximately) spheres. To get a quick understanding of why, let's consider Mercury. It's radius is about 2400km. A sphere that big made from hydrogen gas (at 1 atmosphere of pressure which isn't even remotely realistic) would way about 1 million billion tons. Anything this heavy basically automatically has to be a sphere, as any other shape would just collapse in on itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
