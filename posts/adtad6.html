		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light waves are additive just like sound or any other type of wave. The rainbow effect is caused by something called thin film interference. Basically, light reflects off of both the oil layer, and the water underneath. The two reflections have slightly different wavelengths, and are slightly out of phase. When they recombine, some of the waves cancel out and produce a color other than white. The exact color seen depends on the thickness of the oil layer on top of the water (and the oils refractive index)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The oil forms a thin layer on top of the water. Some light will reflect off of the oil, and some will go through the oil and reflect off of the water. When the light reflecting off of the oil meets the light reflecting off of the water in the air they meet and become friends and can form different colors. The difference in color comes from the different thickness of the oil. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This effect does not originate from the uniformity of thickness of the oil layer, like some others write. Also, the oil layer does not change the wavelength of the incident light in comparison with the reflected light.</p>
<p>But let's ELI5 (not possible without an illustration but I try to dumb it down as much as possible). First, you have to know, that white light is composed of light of many different colors. When you mix some blue, green and some red light, you get white light. I could explain that to you with an old TV, but a five year old like you doesn't know those anymore... So just imagine three flashlights, one makes blue light, one green light and one red. When you point them all at the same spot, the spot will be white.</p>
<p>So we get white light, by mixing coloured light. But you can also get coloured light, by splitting the white light into its components. And here the oil and the water comes into play.</p>
<p>Oil and water can't be mixed easily. The oil is always swimming on top of the water, like the frozen surface of a lake in winter. Imagine a puddle of water, with some oil swimming on top of the water. Here, you have to realize that there are two surfaces: the water surface, and, above it, the oil surface. The incoming light gets reflected by both surfaces. But the light which gets reflected by the water layer has to travel a bit longer than the light which gets reflected by the oil! This difference in distance depends on the so-called inclination angle of the light (and on the thickness of the oil film, but we assume it to be uniform). If the light comes down exactly vertical, the difference is two times the thickness of the oil layer. If the light inclines at some other angle, the difference of distances can be larger.</p>
<p>At certain differences of travelling distances, certain colors are reinforeced or &quot;amplified&quot;. This is because of the effect called &quot;interference&quot;. For that to understand, you have to understand, that light can be thought of a wave. But that is a total big ELI5 chapter for its own.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light is basically a wave and waves can add up with each other when they interfere . The waves reflect and refract off each interface (water/air and oil/water) and meet again at the top and if they interfere constructively the colour shows strongly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
