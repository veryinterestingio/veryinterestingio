		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question makes me excited because I work in a medical laboratory in a hospital.Like someone said most blood tests are actually not done seeing through a microscope. Different tests require different parts of the blood so most get spun down. Plasma is a liquid you get when you spin down blood, serum is a fluid that you also get when blood is spun. They are both very similar but plasma contains fibdinogen and serum does not. You have different colored vials with different types of additives for each test. Some tests require a chilled vial or pre heated vial. If that's the case you can only run one test off that vial. There are so many interactions with tests more than you can imagine. If your doctor orders a Complete blood count (CBC) the blood will be drawn in a &quot;lavender&quot; top vial that has an anticoagulant. Your blood would clot within seconds if it was drawn in an empty vial with no additives. The CBC test checks the count of white blood cells and red cells and a whole bunch more about your cells. If your cells clump (clot) there would be a wrong count of cells therefore you need blood that wont clot. If your doctor orders a complete metabolic panel (CMP) you will most likely get drawn in a tube with a gel like substance at the bottom of the vial. The cmp test has multiple tests within it self like your glucose, electrolytes, liver function etc. Each analyzer uses a certain amount of serum or plasma (the yellow stuff at the top of spun blood) to run the cmp. The amount needed is very little but its standard to draw one whole vial even if it's just a cmp. Sometimes doctors add on tests afterwards because they want to check something else and it saves you a trip and a poke. Sometimes our analyzer re runs the same test if there is a problem with aspiration or whatever. A cmp test is an example of a test that requires very little serum or plasma. There are tests that have over 30 tests within itself and you may need two vials for just that &quot;1&quot; test. Most tests are actually panels which mean multiple tests in 1 test. Not all laboratories run every test your doctor orders. If you every had blood drawn before at your local hospital chances are your tests weren't even ran there. There are specialized laboratories for some tests and it's cheaper to send that blood out to be tested than buying an analyzer, reagents and such to run it local. If your tests are taking a very long time its most likely due it traveling to another state. You always want more blood than needed. So most of the time we can only use half of 1 vial because it gets spun. All the vials are different sizes and different fill lines. Please be nice with us laboratory folks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what tests are ordered. They also have to process the blood in different ways depending on those tests. As an example, some need to be spun in a centrifuge with anticoagulants mixed in to ensure the blood doesnt clot up inside the tube and ruin the sample. </p>
<p>Of course, there are other tests that look for microbes in the blood which also have to be prepped in certain ways. (I'll yeild to people with more expertise. But this is an oversimplification on my part.)</p>
<p>Lastly, they may take extra samples from one vial if they feel something may have been contaminated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lab work is a LOT like a kitchen. There are all kinds of instruments and a lot of processes that are an awful lot like kitchen appliances and recipes.</p>
<p>So if you think of each test as a different recipe, and each vial as a potato, than you need several potatoes if you want different recipes. If you want mashed potatoes, fries, and baked potatoes then you need 3 potatoes. </p>
<p>If you go through the mashed potato process, then that potato is no good for fries, so you need another one. The more recipes (tests) you are doing, the more potatoes (vials) you need. </p>
<p>Also, very few tests are physically looking at the blood under a microscope.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different tests need different amounts of blood. When you get blood drawn its usually for a panel that might test 10 different things. This might need 3-4 different preparation procedures that all need a certain amount of blood at the start.   </p>
<p>Also, in analytical testing its always better to have too much sample than not enough. The larger the sample size, the less of a chance of random error affecting your results. In addition, having a bit of spare sample is handy in case of an emergency. Maybe your testing instrument is acting up and giving bad results or maybe the new girl is messing up sample prep. Either way, if you have excess sample you can redo the test without needing to re-stick the patient.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
