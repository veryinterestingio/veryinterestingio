		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Freud talked about a few different reasons that may cause it, but I will not go over those unless you ask. I will focus solely on what the Complex itself is.</p>
<p>Basically, in men who have had some sort of psychological development issues, there is a problem in seeing women as a whole and independent person. They have to define each woman they see in a certain way in order to understand them. </p>
<p>The two ways that these men define women is into either the &quot;Madonna&quot; category, or the &quot;Whore&quot; category. </p>
<p>Madonna refers to Mary, the mother of Jesus. Women who fit into this category are loved as holy art. They are objectified to be above and beyond. They are the focus of devotional love and obsession, primarily focused on their purity. However, a man who is in love with a women who they categorize as &quot;Madonna&quot; will be unable to feel sexual attraction towards her, or if he does, he will feel disgusted at himself. The purity and holiness that he identifies with the woman will either keep him from being attracted or make him feel like he has violated a holy a sacred object if he feels sexual desire towards it. </p>
<p>&quot;Whore&quot; of course refers to a woman who is used purely for sexual desire. A woman who fits into this category could never be the focus of the mans love. He will lust after her, but he would be willing to insult and degrade her all the same. She lacks the holy nature of the Madonna. She is solely the focus of the man's darker lusts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A man's primary female role model is his mother, whom he sees morally upstanding and chaste.  As he matures, he becomes sexually attracted to women and sees them as objects of desire.</p>
<p>This creates a conflict.  He desires a woman who will satisfy his lust (the whore), but he also wants a woman who exudes feminine virtue (the madonna).  He is often initially attracted to the madonna and tries to win her physical affection, but once he does, she is no longer the madonna and his attraction fades.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most basically it refers to men’s tendency to split women into either idealised mother figures (the Madonna), who nurture and care for children, or sexually promiscuous sluts (the whore). </p>
<p>Splitting here refers to an internal psychological mechanism that separates representations of one ‘object’ into distinct polarities (eg of good and bad, black and white). Why does this mechanism exist? It is a way of managing the conflict that is generated when we have conflictual feelings about the same object (ie it is one of many defence mechanisms). </p>
<p>In this case, sexual desire and the desire to be mothered are opposed to one another, that is men (or some men, to a greater or lesser extent) struggle to integrate both sexual / aggressive and loving / tender feelings towards the same woman. As a result they idealise some women (but cannot be sexually aroused by them) and denigrate others in a sexually excited way (but cannot love them). It speaks to the situation that where there can be sex there can be no love and where there is love no sex. Extra martial affairs and pornography might be seen as expressions of such splitting. </p>
<p>Lastly I’m not sure that the phrase mother-Madonna-whore came from Freud specifically. Nor did he speak of splitting as such (or only briefly before he died), so aspects of this were developed by other analysts after him.</p>
<p>Edit: I’d just add, whether or not we agree with Freud’s explanation of <em>why</em> such splitting occurs, it seems incontestable that such splitting <em>does</em> occur. The former is a strictly psychoanalytic account which you may agree or disagree with, the latter is merely an identifiable feature of sexuality perhaps more common in men (though that’s open to debate).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
