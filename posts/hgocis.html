		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When science journalists or scientists write to the general public they try to explain things in a way that everyone can understand or, at least, fell the magnitude of the things involved in what they are trying to explain.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>A common  way is translating a certain quantity in another more tangible to the public. For example, saying something is as heavy as a number of elephants or cars (and I personally have no idea of how much an elephant or a car weights!).  And, another really common way, is transforming a physical quantity in something completely different but, in someway, related. For example, some time ago,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyDcTbR-kEA" target="_blank">this video</a> went somewhat viral as &quot;the sound of of two black holes colliding&quot;.  Of course, no sound propagates through space, so what this video really means? In this video, specifically, scientists recorded gravitational waves of the event and then created a audio that had the same sound wave shape as the gravitational wave. So, no real sound was involved in the phenomenon, but some scientists made the sound to illustrate what they got in their research.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I don't know in which context you read about the sound of black holes colliding so I can't explain in detail, but I would say that when a scientist (our science journalist) said &quot;sound of two black holes colliding [is] speculated to be one of the loudest sounds in the universe&quot;, they were meaning &quot;there is no other phenomenon that creates more powerful gravitational waves than two black holes colliding&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see a lot of wrong answers, so I'll try and explain it as simple as possible.
Sound cannot travel through the vacuum of space, it requires more matter being present than what is available in your typical empty space.
However a black hole is not empty space. Is it surrounded by gases and matter from all the material it has eaten. The statement is quite literal; two black holes colliding produce the densest, lowest frequency sound waves we know of. If you were present and somehow had a way of surviving not only the vacuum of space and the extreme conditions of the black hole, but also had a way of listening to such low frequencies, you would find it to be indeed quite loud. The sound waves travel throughout the gases and matter absorbed by the black holes reign.
Of course, if you were to watch from a distance with space between you and the black hole, the sound would not have a medium to reach you and it would be silent.
But if you were in the accretion disc, oh boy would your eardrums not be happy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sound is like waves in a pond.  Throw in a rock, ripples or waves spread out.  These waves are many times bigger than sound waves.  </p>
<p>We humans hang out in the air, and so our ears are good (well better) at hearing sound in air.  Not so good at hearing the sound waves in water.  </p>
<p>Sound waves travel through all kinds of other stuff too.  Put your ear to a railroad track and you can hear trains that are far out of sight.  You might've seen an old western movie where an Indian puts his ear to the ground and can hear horses approaching from a long way.  </p>
<p>All that is to say, air is not a requirement.  &quot;Sound&quot; is just waves moving through &quot;stuff&quot;.</p>
<p>As for a near vaccum like space, Black Holes affect the universe itself.  Their huge gravity (think of a bowling ball on a bed sheet) stretches space-time so much that not even light (fastest thing possible) can get out.  Two of these super duper deep space-time mamas banging together send out gravity waves (<a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">LIGO</a> big deal from a couple of years back).  Really big ones.</p>
<p>So maybe our ears can't hear it, but out special microphones (LIGO) can hear them from across a galaxy.  Further, they can listen in on Black Hole rock'n'roll in different galaxies (The milky way is ~52k light years across, LIGO has heard stuff from 800 million light years away).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something else to consider: there CAN be sound in space. Sound is a vibration traveling through matter. When we talk about &quot;space not having sound&quot; we actually mean that sound can't exist in a vacuum. </p>
<p>So another question this creates for me is: assuming  I was floating around a pair of black holes colliding, would there be enough matter circulating those black holes outside of the event horizons to propagate sound waves?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just because you can’t hear it doesn’t mean it’s not loud. </p>
<p>If I were to shoot a gun in space, it would still be objectively louder than if I were to whisper. There may not be sound waves that reach your ears but the actual event remains the same whether you hear it or not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
