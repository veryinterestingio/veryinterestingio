		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Remastering basically has two components: reworking the mix and &quot;restoring&quot; the audio.   </p>
<p>Studio gear, even back in the day, typically records each instrument and vocals onto separate tracks.  That's re-balanced, along with often having some equalization applied, to provide a &quot;polished&quot; final sound for various audiences.  FM isn't very good at transmitting the highest and lowest audible frequencies, and back then a lot of audio gear wasn't good at reproducing the highest frequencies either. So an old FM mix tends to have boosted bass around 80hz and treble somewhere in the 7k-10k range to give the impression of a &quot;full sound&quot; where a vinyl production wouldn't have those boosts.  Things like that.  So in a remaster they re-work the balance between those different studio tracks (where it's still available) and tweak the equalization to match modern tastes.   </p>
<p>For &quot;Restoring&quot; the audio, there may be loss from the recording material, the microphones themselves weren't great at recording the highest end and some things like that.  We have algorithms now that are intended to bring out or clean up missing or distorted sounds from technological differences, degraded recording media and so on.   It may be cleaning up static or trying to restore the very upper end &quot;sparkle&quot; to things like cymbals or sibilance to the &quot;s&quot; sound in vocals.   Bringing out that kind of thing is more art than science and is a lot about taste.   </p>
<p>So...that's what a remaster is for, adjusting the mix to modern tastes and playing around with some equalization/digitization magic to try and make it sound like a brand new recording on the best gear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is not in fact re-recorded!</p>
<p>Imagine a song being a car. In the old days, when you bought it, a red car was all the rage but through the years, the color has faded, the polish doesn’t look as fresh anymore and the red color is not modern at all now. You don’t build a new car from similar materials, because you like the car. You take your car to be sanded down to the metal, and then you have it repainted in a new sparkly and much more modern color, and you add a nice new polish so it really shines and looks as it was a brand new car.</p>
<p>Basically when a song is mixed and subsequently mastered, the raw sounds recorded such as the drums, vocals or sounds from the amplifiers, are edited to fit better together. This is done with a range of tools such as reverb, delay, saturation, compressors, limiters or even equalizers to highlight certain frequencies of an instrument or the whole song, and in general setting the volume of one instrument compared to the others.
Some mix engineers prefer specific parts of a song to be louder and quieter than others for example how much the vocals are in front or ‘hidden’ deeper in the mix.
When all of that sounds good, the song is mastered to ‘glue’ the whole song together and make sure that it is at a specific volume matching all other songs out there so there isn’t a big difference in volume when the radio or Spotify switches from a Beatles song to a Katy Perry song.</p>
<p>But why do it again now, so many years later?</p>
<p>There can be many reasons, but for example with The Beatles, they were some of the first to record electric guitars so since then we have learned a lot about recording, mixing and editing electric guitars. They may be very rough on the original songs and generally not ‘pleasing’ to listen to.</p>
<p>The equipment we use today has also evolved a lot so everything is much more clearer now. Something that a mix engineer couldn’t hear 40-60 years ago can much more easily be heard on modern studio monitors and seen with modern visualization tools. That way we can now control the frequencies much tighter.</p>
<p>Song is mixed and mastered depending on the primary listening medium. If you mix/master for vinyl it is going to sound different from streaming, simply due to different storage methods.
The old Beatles songs were recorded on an analog medium (tape) and has since been converted to a digital media to use on Spotify, and surely some quality would be lost in that conversion.</p>
<p>So in short, a remaster <em>may</em> also mean it has been re-mixed (not remixed), but it could also just be only the final polishing of the song to ensure it has more clarity and fits better with our modern ways of listening to music.
An engineers job is always for the music to sound as good as it can on as many devices as possible - some people have hifi speakers worth thousands, others will listen on their smart phone speaker.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You basically take the original, highest quality recordings and then redo the final &quot;mastering&quot; process of the songs, except this time it's for a new medium. You also might need to redo part of the mixing stage, which is a bit more complicated.  </p>
<p>Mastering is the final stage of music production, you send the mixed song off to an audio engineer and they make it sound as loud and clear as possible for the intended medium (be it vinyl record, CD, etc), all while testing it on different audio setups, removing certain resonances and audio hiccups and such. Remasters usually try to make songs sound better for modern audiences and streaming platforms, following all the suggested guidelines regarding volume and such.  </p>
<p>Songs from the 60s, etc, were meant to be listened to on vinyl record or the radio, not headphones in a pristine digital audio stream. So the mastering engineer's job (or even mixer if the songs need to be mixed again) is to make the songs fit this new world, to squeeze all the new juice they can from those original super high quality recordings they've got stored somewhere.  </p>
<p>If you're also remixing (which is quite common), you'd also be redoing parts of the mix itself to fit modern sensibilities and such, maybe the song is very old and the drums are too quiet/badly mixed, who knows! anyways, hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Songs aren’t just recorded at once, on one microphone.  Each instrument and singer usually has their own microphone and are frequently recorded separately so that each of those elements can be mixed together by the band and producer.  Remastering a song involves going back to those original recordings and mixing them again.  This could mean any number of things like boosting/lowering the relative volume of individual elements to emphasize different aspects of the song, applying or removing EQ or other effects like reverb, or simply creating a stereo mix from a mono recoding.  Often times for older songs it involves re-digitizing the master recordings at a higher quality than was previously possible too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
