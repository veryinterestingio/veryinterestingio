		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>“Cartel” is a word that comes from economics. A cartel is a group of businesses that agree to stop competing with each other and instead decide on one, high price that all the businesses will charge. This makes prices much higher for consumers than they would be if the businesses were competing, and makes them more money.</p>
<p><del>The drug trafficking organizations are called “cartels” because that’s what they are. They are groups of semi-independent drug dealers that work together instead of competing.</del></p>
<p>Credit to   u/Zombiac3 and u/greenops and others for pointing out a mistake. The original Mexican and Colombian cartels were true cartels, but were eventually centralized by powerful leaders or broke back apart. The name, however, has stuck. Their modern behavior is not very cartel-like anymore.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>“Mafia” is a word that comes from Sicilian that originally meant “bold” or “full of swagger”. It eventually became the English-language name for Sicilian crime families in the US, and was later applied to other ethnic criminal groups.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll give you a simple example:</p>
<p>- <strong>Cartel</strong>: McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's all get together and decide that they will offer a burger for no less than $10, fries for no lo less than $5, and a soda for no less than $3. If you don't want to pay these prices, than you don't get to eat at these restaurants. Simple as that. </p>
<p>- <strong>Mafia</strong>: The owner of a local McDonald's is forced to pay the town's &quot;boss&quot; a fixed 10% of all revenue. If the McDonald's makes $1 million in revenue during the year, the boss is getting $100,000. If the manager of the McDonald's decides they don't want to pay the boss anymore, there is a high likelihood of danger for both himself and McDonald's restaurant. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A cartel is an economics term which refers to a group of companies who collude to jack up prices.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the mafia typically refers to criminal organisations that engage in organised crime. </p>
<p>The confusion may arise because in some countries, cartelisation is illegal as it is deemed anti-competitive. OPEC is an example of an organisation that is often referred to as a cartel, but is not illegal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add another layer to what's being said here, in Italy Mafia and organized crime are labeled as different things. The mafia tries to substitute the state, from protection to direct political favors, while organized crime only aims at profit; obviously the two go hand in hand, but they're punished differently here. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
