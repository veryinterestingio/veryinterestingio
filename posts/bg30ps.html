		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think we can reliably estimate how many &quot;pre-cancers&quot; a healthy immune system can detect and destroy, but one of the major complications after a solid organ transplant is the risk for developing cancer due to the severe immune suppression needed to prevent transplant rejection. According to this article by Webster et al. (2007): &quot;Cancer is a major source of morbidity and mortality following solid organ transplantation. Overall risk of cancer is increased between two-  and threefold compared with the general population of the same age and  sex. Recipients of solid organ transplants typically experience cancer  rates similar to nontransplanted people 20–30 years older, and risk is  inversely related to age, with younger recipients experiencing a far  greater relative increase in risk compared with older recipients (risk  increased by 15–30 times for children, but twofold for those  transplanted &gt;65 years)&quot;. So you can theorize that the immune system catches some in younger people (depending on the overall health of the person-some people have things that predispose them to developing cancer), with the immune system being unable to keep up as we age.   Webster AC, Craig JC, Simpson JM, Jones MP, Chapman JR 2007.  Identifying high risk groups and quantifying  absolute risk of cancer after kidney transplantation: A cohort study of  15,183 recipients.

Good rule of thumb average mutation rate is about 1 in 1 million base pairs during DNA replication- almost all of those are immediately repaired or rectified. That sounds like a little but it adds up to a huge number. There is still so much we don't understand that appears to be related to oncogenesis, like telomeres</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a cancer survivor park about a block from me. One of the plaques says on average a person generates and destroys 10 precancer cells per day. Let's say you live to be 80. That's roughly 80 years x 365 days/year x 10 precancer cells/ day = 292,000 precancer cells destroyed during your life.  </p>
<p>You body is really, really good at catching and correcting its mistakes, and its constantly making mistakes considering how complicated your cellular machinery is. So when someone actually gets cancer there's been a major breakdown in the systems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Side question: when somebody says that smoking, drinking or some other vice will increase your chance of getting cancer by x%, what's that x derived from? Like if you now have a 0.05% percent of getting cancer, then it's 0.10%? Is it always the same factor, what about time/age/etc? Don't other living habits count as much, is it legal to even say such a thing with any medical accuracy?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well thats a tricky question because there is such an extensive list of different things that we call cancer. For instance almost everyone  male develops things we call prostate cancer in their lifetime that is sufficiently suppressed for us not to die from before we die from something else.</p>
<p>Follicular thyroid modules are extremely common, and cancerous ones of these are histologically identical in terms of cells and markers, and only the ones whose invasive ness fails to be suppressed are identified and treated as malignancies.</p>
<p>We shed certain cells all the time in parts of the body that are continuously exposed to our environment such as skin and digestive epithelium, and so many of the cells that would become cancer are simply sloughed away. As deeper cells that we retain longer become exposed to toxins, radiation, and chemicals over lifetimes, eventually some of them become precancerous dysplasia that we can observe until they start to exhibit features that resemble cancer which we call high grade dysplasia or eventually neoplasia which is truly a cancer.</p>
<p>So what we call cancer is really the interplay between cells that have features with tendency to disrespect things like tissue density and boundary feedback mechanisms as well as our body’s failure to suppress those actions of the rogue tissue. </p>
<p>In our colons these dysplasia grow very slowly over years into things we call polyps that can be removed during colonoscopy or with surgery to prevent the ultimate degeneration to malignant potential, but sometimes parts of them probably do just slough off on their own. </p>
<p>You can see actinic keratosis which is a precancerous lesions of the skin just covering people’s entire bodies that have lifelong sun damage and most of these still never go on to become full blown cancers and the dermatologist can freeze
off a few of these each visit before they ever become a problem. </p>
<p>Many areas of our body have aggregates of cells that are in a lifelong transformation toward becoming malignancy in this way. By the time we are elderly, it’s entirely possible that almost all parts of our body have cells that are trending toward a full-blown malignancy capable of metastasis and unchecked growth despite relatively normal
Immune function.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
