<p>Then I saw a butterfly in my garden and it occured to me. I've never had a butterfly enter my house. Not ever. Not accidentally, not deliberately...and it's the only type of common garden insect I can think of which hasn't done that.</p>
<p>Why is this?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are fewer of them, they don’t breed indoors (like flies, spiders, etc…) and their preferred environment is foliage. Spiders live in your walls and can easily sneak in and out through tiny cracks. Same with ants. Mosquitoes actively prey on people, so they follow us inside. Flies can breed, grow, and hatch completely within your home with the right conditions.</p>
<p>There are literally millions of insects that you don’t see in your home very often. Even super common stuff like grasshoppers aren’t generally found in homes because they’re too big to sneak in and don’t have any reason to be inside.</p>
<p>Edit: Yes I know grasshoppers CAN get inside. But comparatively, they are rare. Think of how many ants you’ve seen indoors compared to grasshoppers. Now think about where you’ve seen them. Insects are attracted to things. You usually don’t see ants until you leave out some fruit or something. The next day, swarming. Why? They were there the whole time, but didn’t find anything worth their time, until they did. Don’t underestimate insects ability to smell/sense stuff they want (food, temp, light, etc…). If you create a hospitable environment, you’ll get them inside. If you don’t, you probably won’t.</p>
<p>Edit 2: I didn’t mean there are millions of insects inside your home right now that you don’t see. I meant there are millions of insects NOT in your home. Butterflies are simply one of millions that aren’t often found in your home. Somebody mentioned the outrageous numbers of beetles you don’t see indoors as an example. There are more species you don’t find in your house than species you do find.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many insects are attracted by artificial lights at night, and they will enter your home to get near them provided you haven't put a screen in the way. Butterflies are diurnal rather than nocturnal, and they're resting while this is going on. Personally I've had numerous katydids enter my home looking for light, so it's not all moths and deer flies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
