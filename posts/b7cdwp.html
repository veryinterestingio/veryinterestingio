		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, schizophrenic here, also happen to have a penchant for neurology (for the obvious reason). So, the thing that a lot of people have difficulty understanding is that there is this thought that schizophrenia is just like dropping acid or something, which I can say is not the case (I've done some pretty heavy doses of hallucinogens back in the day). The unique thing is that the hallucinations more often than not seem real. </p>
<p>For example, let's say I hear knocking on the door. I'm going to assume someone is at the door, and I'm going to go see if there's anybody there. If nobody is there, I assume I was hallucinating when I heard that knock. It does for all intents and purposes seem completely real at that point.</p>
<p>There are different levels of lucidity based upon how detached from reality a person is (we call this 'psychosis'). Naturally, a person who is less psychotic at that moment will be able to more accurately distinguish between what is real and what isn't, however it's not always quite so simple. Antipsychotics do help ground people with schizophrenia, but they are very far from any sort of 'cure' and they do have notoriously terrible side effects.</p>
<p>As for what goes on in the brain, imaging has shown that during periods of hallucination, there is observable activity on an MRI of speech processing occurring as though actual audible voices are being heard. It looks the same as if someone was in the room talking to them or if they were hallucinating during the scan. </p>
<p>Unlike many other mental illnesses, schizophrenia, schizoaffective, and bipolar have a much more neurological root than a psychiatric one. There has actually been quite a bit of interest in reclassifying the psychotic disorders as neurological instead of psychological. This would make sense in that it more accurately pinpoints the source of the issues and also may reduce a lot of the stigma.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work in the mental health field and worked with schizophrenics. My patient described it like being in a busy coffee shop but it differs from person to person but it is perceived as a &quot;normal&quot; sound. As with all hallucinations audible or visual, the voices seem very real and, chemically, the hallucination is tricking the neurons in the brain to perceive it as real. Some people experience the hallucinations as violent voices and others experience background noise like my patient did. The trouble is when the patient isn't treated their perception of reality begins to skew which can make a schizophrenic person violent. However, if treated, it is a manageable mental illness. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
