		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The end immunity achieved is largely the same but the process by which it is achieved is vastly different and what is most important.</p>
<p>Vaccinations use the specific parts of the virus which are sufficient for infection, and this lets the body develop a specific immunity to those bits without risking a FULL infection. Antibodies produced will be largely the same since these parts are often compounds that viruses will be displaying on their protein surface and subsequently, the surface of an infected cell. The point of this is to avoid any form of infection while the body signals the production of antibodies for a new substance. </p>
<p>With actual infection, the virus has a chance to infect the body with only T-Cells (those which fight off infected cells but not the virus itself) defending the body against the infection. The real deal is the B-cells and their eventual descendants Memory B-Cells. With severe infections the time it takes to develop these B-Cells is not enough to keep the virus from doing real damage to the body. </p>
<p>Within an already vaccinated individual, the B-cells which initially fought off the hoax infection (the vaccine) will have produced memory B-cells. These are stored away, for future references. Now they don’t need to develop a new cell with new receptors to recognize the virus, they just need to go bat shit crazy replicating those few memory cells. </p>
<p>The difference in time that it takes for the body to fight back effectively is what saves lives. With a vaccine I don’t need to wait for the fever, the macrophages, and the T-cells to hold the line with their [relatively] inaccurate targeting. With the vaccine I already have all the things necessary. </p>
<p>Immunity achieved is the pretty much the same. But the manner in which it is achieved is definitely not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Someone else addressed the point broadly but I'd like to give some exceptional examples.</p>
<p>Measles can eliminate your immune memory making you susceptible to other diseases you were immune to. The vaccine does not cause this. </p>
<p>Also the chickenpox vaccine reduces you likelyhood of chickenpox reinfection and shingles better than catching and recovering from chickenpox.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a really neat clinically relevant example of this.</p>
<p>Hepatitis B vaccination produces antibodies to Hep B surface antigen.</p>
<p>Infection with hepatitis B produces antibodies to hep B core antigen. Sometimes it produces hep B surface antibodies - these folks will generally clear the virus. </p>
<p>Therefore we can actually tell the difference between immunity to hep B from vaccination and infection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some vaccines use specific antigens, so they would induce host immune response against more a limited set of epitopes. e.g. Current SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates that are furtherest along in clinical trials all use the spike protein or a specific protein domain thereof.</p>
<p>Some vaccines do not induce the full spectrum of host immune response as the real virus might. e.g. <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(20)30610-3.pdf" target="_blank">SARS-CoV-2 induces</a> humoral response (i.e. antibodies secreted by B cells) as well as cellular response, including both CD4+ helper T cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. However, published SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates all induced B cell response and CD4+ T cell response, but most do not induce a strong CD8+ cytotoxic T cell response. This is the case fo the <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2022483" target="_blank">mRNA-1273</a>.</p>
<p>For a vaccine candidate to be approved, it must demonstrate sufficient protection. In this regard, the immunity that result from recovering from the infection vs. from an approved vaccine may be inconsequential, so long as protection is conferred.</p>
<p>As for whether one would want a population of individuals to become immune via vaccination or infection, the difference would be in the death toll. The death toll would be much lower in a properly designed and executed vaccination program vs. a natural herd immunity strategy.</p>
<p>It is also worth remarking that immunity against SARS-CoV-2 appears short-lived, and that has to do with the biology of the host-pathogen interaction, and it is a scientific question that is still under investigation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
