		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What nobody ITT has mentioned so far is that when you purchase seedless watermelons from a <a href="https://www.johnnyseeds.com/growers-library/vegetables/watermelon-triploid-seedless-production.html" target="_blank">seed catalog </a> they actually send you two packs of seeds. One pack has the diploid type one pack has the triploid type and you plant them together in the field or greenhouse so that the diploid pollinates the triploid producing seedless fruit on the triploid plants.</p>
<p>Edit: The diploid type is usually a variety selected because it produces a lot of flowers over a long period of time to provide pollen for the triploid plants. Without pollination the triploid plants donâ€™t get the signal to start forming fruits. Interestingly the diploid plants will produce fruit as well (with seeds) but is easily distinguishable from the seedless fruits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To make a baby, mom and dad make special cells that combine to make a baby. These special cells are called &quot;germ cells&quot;. Each germ cell has half of special instructions to make the cells that will make up a new person, and you need both halves of the instructions, one from the mom and one from the dad, in order to make a new person.</p>
<p>Almost all cells in your body will have an entire set of its special instructions to make it work, and when the cell divide to make new cells, they will make another full copy of these instructions.</p>
<p>These special instructions are written on a tiny books called &quot;chromosomes&quot;. Because these special instructions are so important, we have two copies of each book, or chromosome, so that if one of the books gets smudged or copied wrong, our cells can rely on the other book to figure out what to do.</p>
<p>But remember, the germ cell is special because it only has half of the special instructions. Luckily for us, figuring out which half of the special instructions to put into a germ cell is much easier because we have two copies of each chromosome: we put one copy of each book into each germ cell instead of both copies.</p>
<p>To do this, the chromosomes do a little dance while a cell divides. The chromosomes find their partner and then line up. One partner gets pulled to opposite sides of the cell, and the cell splits in half into germ cells. This process of making a germ cell with only a single copy of each chromosome is called &quot;meiosis&quot;.</p>
<p>Some plants are like people too. They need to have a germ cell from a mom and a dad in order to make new baby plants. Seeds that grow into plants are cells that have already have combined the instructions from a mom and dad germ cell.</p>
<p>Watermelons are a special type of plant that can either have two copies or four copies of the chromosomes, the books that half all the special instructions. When you have seeds that have four copies of chromosomes, they undergo meiosis normally, and the germ cells have two copy of the chromosomes.</p>
<p><strong>Seedless watermelons come from seeds that were made from combining a parent with two copies of chromosomes with four copies of chromosomes.</strong> From one parent, the seedless watermelon will inherit one set of chromosomes, and from the other parent, it will inherit two sets of chromosomes. <strong>That means that it will have three sets of chromosomes in most of its cells.</strong></p>
<p>A seedless watermelon can grow up looking normal, but it has a bit of trouble when it comes to making germ cells of its through meiosis.</p>
<p>Remember that the cells do a special dance to find its partner? <strong>Well, when you have three copies of each chromosome</strong>, they have a lot of trouble finding a dance partner, and so <strong>the process of creating germ cells become a lot more difficult.</strong></p>
<p>That's why in seedless watermelons don't have seeds, because they can't make the germ cells that would end up becoming seeds.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Seedless watermelons are seedless because it was born with three sets of each book and their books can't find dance partners. But its parents could make seeds because they had two or four sets of each book.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>How do people grow seedless watermelons?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They plant seeds for seedless watermelons and they grow. ðŸ˜‹</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like where do they get the seeds?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Farmers buy those seeds from seed manufacturers (like Monsanto or DuPont).</p>
<p>If you are asking how are seedless watermelon seeds created, then that has to do with the cross-breeding of two specific strains of watermelon -- <em>one diploid (normal complement of DNA) with one tetraploid (double the normal amount of DNA)</em> -- which results in a sterile strain. So seedless watermelons are sterile, meaning that they can produce no offspring, so the seeds present (they are not truly seedless) are very slight and are hardly noticed when eaten.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
