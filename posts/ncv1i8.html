		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Edit: Tax law is complex, and not easy to explain to five year olds (I have two of them and they never seem interested when I try). The ELI5 / TLDR answer to the OP's question is that there's much less 'hiding' than is often thought. Where they do, it's because they're following tax advice and implementing lawful structures, or because they're breaking the law.</strong></p>
<p>I'm a lawyer in the Cayman Islands, who sets up entities and so-called 'special purpose vehicles' all day for the last 10+ years. There is a LOT of misinformation here - the financial industry equivalent of 'bro science'.</p>
<p>It used to be possible to arrive at the Cayman Islands airport and request a police escort to the bank, such was the amount of cash in bags arriving on the Islands. This service stopped in the early 1980s, but the image and myth of secret offshore accounts persists.</p>
<p>First, the &quot;rental of IP&quot; discussed here does not work, at least not in the Cayman Islands or any of the other classic jurisdictions (BVI, Bermuda, etc.). I can't comment on the less well-regulated ones like Panama or Belize, etc. The reason it does not work is that modern international laws require companies that engage in activities that are deemed likely to give rise to artificial tax structuring (such as holding IP, or making loans, etc.) to have 'substance' in the country they are registered. So it's fine to have your IP in a Cayman Islands company provided your factory or office is in the Cayman Islands, you work on your IP here, you have workers here, a substantial presence etc. Most companies do not want to do that, but there are many that do, and proceed to open offices here.</p>
<p>Second, the idea that you can just open a bank account here (or any other modern country) and hide money here is also not true. There are over 100 countries party to the &quot;Common Reporting Standards&quot; (CRS) whereby all banks, funds, trust companies and essentially anyone handling money has to tell all of the other countries (via an international framework) that they have an account holder from France, her name is XYZ, etc. This reporting is automatic. There is also a mechanism under that framework for France to request even more details from the Cayman Islands (or any of the other 100+ countries) about that account. The irony is that the US is not party to this arrangement, so provides absolutely no information about money in US accounts to anyone else in the world. It does have a similar mechanism in respect of US citizens (FATCA), so if you open a Cayman, BVI, Bahamas etc. bank account that will all be reported directly back to the IRS. So you're welcome to open an account, but you cannot 'hide' money here from the IRS or any other country.</p>
<p>Ah, you say, let's just hide the fact that this is my account with a clever trust structure. This doesn't work either. Again, international frameworks for anti-money laundering require offshore banks to find out who the 'ultimate beneficial owner' is of all accounts - i.e. the human beings at the top. The threshold in most offshore jurisdictions is all 10%+ owners (in most countries it is 25%). This information is shared with the government and there are significant fines on companies and their service providers for failing to maintain it. This information is also reported via FATCA and CRS as mentioned above.</p>
<p>The reason the Cayman Islands always appears to have so much offshore cash in it is because (a) of old arrangements set up before any of this became law, which remain here because they're perfectly legal, and (b) because the Cayman Islands is by far the largest offshore investment funds market in the world. In other words, big fund managers set up vehicles here to combine money from international (non-US) investors before investing it onwards around the world. It makes sense to do this somewhere where the vehicle itself will not be subject to tax, so that a German investor just pays tax in Germany, a French in France, etc. The only US investors it makes sense to use these structures are what are called &quot;US Tax Exempts&quot; - in other words charities, pension funds, endowments, etc. whose gains are not subject to tax in any event in their home country so aren't avoiding anything.</p>
<p>In short, a lot of the cliches in the comments here are derived from an old and outdated stereotype - it's a running joke in the offshore world that John Grisham's <em>The Firm</em> was the worst piece of advertising for the Cayman Islands that we could have ever hoped for.</p>
<p>I should say that there are of course examples uncovered every so often where criminals mis-use offshore vehicles, although often it turns out the jurisdiction in question has been informing the IRS for years about the account and the IRS just ignores the information. The Panama Papers was an embarrassment precisely because it showed that there are jurisdictions that have not signed up to the above regimes where it is still possible to 'park' money. But it is much easier, for example, to hide money in a Delaware vehicle (because of the US's complete lack of a unified anti-money laundering framework) or a UK LLP (which require no accounts or membership information / beneficial ownership) than it is in the BVI, Bermuda or Cayman.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>EDIT: apparently I must make it clear that this isn’t financial advice and may not be 100% accurate to current legislation. I don’t know the answers to all your questions, you can ask u/JeffFromSchool as he has a friend in the caymans financial industry</em> It’s used a lot for holding companies. Let’s say you have business X but whenever business X makes money you have to pay tax on it. So you make business Y in the caymans. Business X made $1 million in net revenue this year, but oh no! It also has to pay business Y $1 million for renting its intellectual property (the “idea/concept” for the business). Now that business X has write offs equal to its income, it has netted $0 profit so tax of course will be zero. Business Y has netted profit but there’s no/little income tax in the Cayman Islands. So you get to keep all your money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically, everyone could do it. But there's a &quot;critical mass&quot; of cash needed for it to be worthwhile in both hassle and fees VS the taxes you dodge (or anything else). Put simply, it's a matter of cost VS reward.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m an international tax lawyer in the us that deals extensively with offshore entities. It’s as simple as forming a company and putting money in it and not reporting it to your home jurisdiction that often wants to tax you on the income.</p>
<p>If you’re a US person, the rules have made it nearly impossible to do this. We have forced all non-us banks worldwide to tattle on US account holders to the IRS (see: FATCA). Even if the account is owned indirectly through, say, a BVI company.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for non-US people, the US has become a premier jurisdiction to hide money using US companies like LLCs. This is because we don’t generally tax foreigners here in the US on their passive investment income, and we don’t collect information on who owns companies, and if we do collect any information we don’t share it with other countries automatically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
