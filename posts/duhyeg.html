		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People here are mentioning jaws getting smaller over time which is true, but our diets also play a huge part in it. We eat a lot of grains and processed foods and it really fucks our teeth up. Aboriginal Australians were documented to have amazing and perfect teeth prior to getting more and more integrated into British prison culture. After they started eating diets that were heavy in processed foods, their entire health in general took a nose dive. One man who watched the whole thing happen said they went from looking like super men to your average overweight joes in just a single generation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably because of the same reason that we have problems with wisdom teeth.  Over time, human's jaws have shortened.  This doesn't leave enough room for all the teeth to come in nice and straight.  This is believed to be due to our propensity for cooking food and eating meat, which don't need as much chewing/grinding as a lot of the foods early man consumed.  Since we didn't need as much grinding area, our evolution allowed for our jaws to shorten. Even if it left us snaggle-toothed sometimes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans used to be chewing roots and hard stuff all the time which put outward pressure on our teeth which kept them straight.</p>
<p>Over time, our diets changed to softer foods so we weren't chewing for 50% of our waking lives. This took away the outward pressure and left us with crooked teeth.</p>
<p>Ancient skulls did not have the transition to softer foods</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a dentist in the <del>50s</del> in the 20s and 30s who set out to document this phenomenon around the world-- he took photos people's teeth in cultures all around the world that hadn't yet been exposed to the Western diet. Later he went back after those cultures did eat more globalized diets for some years, and the children had much of the same dental issues as we see in the Western world. He wrote a whole book about it, mostly to do with diet, which became the basis for things like the paleo diet. Weston Price, &quot;Nutrition and Physical Degeneration&quot;... but a much more accessible book with all the same info + how to eat a more traditional/healthy diet with recipes that are actually surprisingly DELICIOUS is &quot;Nourishing Traditions&quot; by Sally Fallon. The current trend of bone broths is also derived from his work-- Price argued that all societies around the world rely heavily on bone broths (whether beef, chicken, fish) for minerals, etc. Also grassfed meat/dairy, and fish oil. His work is really very influential and Nourishing Traditions is worth looking into.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
