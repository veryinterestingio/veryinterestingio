		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had always just believed it was because they were isolated, but I'd been thinking about it lately and that just doesn't hold up.  Can someone familiar with code breaking and encryption help me understand why they were nearly impossible to understand, while almost every other cipher was eventually cracked?  Thank you!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First; the Navajo language wasn't widely known or cataloged, even within North America, let alone outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second; it wasn't just that the code talkers were speaking Navajo, it's that they were also using Navajo words as replacements for the 26 letter military alphabet. The problem for the Japanese is that the code talkers switched very easily between having direct unciphered conversations in Navajo and ciphered conversations relying on Navajo words, thus there was (seemingly) no rhyme or reason behind the messages from the perspective of the Japanese.</p>
<p>Third, and as an extension of the above; many codes were essentially mechanical (i.e. Enigma), meaning that a codebreaker could expect the coded language to follow a rigorous and strictly-defined set of &quot;rules.&quot; The code talkers were using a much more organically-derived language for their code, which meant that rules were much harder to follow, and the code talkers were free to break those rules as they see fit because of how human language works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not only is Navajo a super difficult language, it’s got a lot of idiom and descriptive language where English or German speakers would use nouns. Just google “Navajo weather report”. Plus, code talkers actually agreed on a code and it described actions in fanciful language and called military terms various animals. So, long messages in a guttural, high-inflection language with no roots to Romance or Asian languages, spoken in idioms and substitution of critter names or descriptions for nouns. I picked up medical Spanish in two months, but I’ve been surrounded by the Navajo language for two years and I got nothing but hello and thank you. There’s tons of younger Navajo who can’t speak it and barely understand it because it’s just...hard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was a poorly documented language with no speakers in Germany or japan.  It had multiple encryption layers - it was not just English encoded in another language. To translate it, first you needed the vocabulary.  Then you needed to understand the grammar - to understand whether “boy dog bite” means the boy bit the dog or the dog bit the boy.  Then there was the idioms - the code talkers were all from the same community and talked to each other like native speakers from the same neighbourhood.  You would need to understand that sayings like “we are going to make a few omelettes” meant things were going to get messy and not that they were making breakfast.  And lastly, they did word substitutions - so even when you got through all of that, you would need to know that (for example - I don’t know the actual code words) “orange mushroom” meant “the president”.  </p>
<p>In many ways, it was a very robust encryption technique, the only risk being if the enemy had a native Navaho speaker that the allies didn’t know about.</p>
<p>Edit:  Thank you kind stranger for the gold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other's have already explained that the language was not well known. In fact, Navajo was not the only native language used and there are some others as well for that reason.  </p>
<p>But the thing about Navajo in particular is that it is a tonal language.  This means that a given word can have multiple, unrelated meanings depending on the tone with which it is pronounced.  Chinese is also a tonal language, for example. This makes it much more difficult to figure out.  From what I understand, Navajo is a particularly difficult language to learn in the first place.  </p>
<p>On top of that,the coded version was made purposely so that only the most skillful speakers could speak and understand it in real time. Only a single non-Navajo speaker could manage it (they had several who had grown up with the Navajo) and many actual navajo were unable to qualify.  This made it next to impossible, even if the Japanese could figure out which language it was (already unlikely) and get their hands on a native speaker (already nearly impossible) to actually decode anything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing to keep in mind is that they were mostly used tactically, where the value of deciphering drops by the hour</p>
<p>Hence the ease with which a natural speaker can transmit a message (without relying on machines or tables) made them very valuable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
