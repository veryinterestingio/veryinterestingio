		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You got some good explanations here. As a blind person myself, I think the most important reason for it is space. Even with braille, and even with the contraction system in which a few signs replace common long words, still braille books are really big. A novel in braille usually is printed in several installments and each of those is much bigger than the novel itself. If we used raised print letters the books would be even larger.</p>
<p>Plus, writing raised print letters would be hard and cumbersome, while writing braille is relatively easy.</p>
<p>Another, more modern consideration is braille displays. These are devices that connect to a computer or cellphone and show the text sent by the device in braille using a bunch of pins that go up and down. A device to show print letters in a tactile format would be even more expensive than the already expensive braille display devices.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I recall correctly, it actually used to be, a few hundred years ago when people first started thinking about thisand books started being printed en masse. Here's a good podcast episode by 99percent invisible that covers it: <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-universal-page/" target="_blank">The Universal Page</a>.</p>
<p>Non-blind people tried to help blind people read by making the books embossed so they could feel the words page. </p>
<p>Some of the main problems with just embossing the letters so they stand out are:</p>
<p>- For fingers to feel them accurately, you need to make the letters bigger. This means books are bigger, and more expensive.</p>
<p>- Back when this was being first thought about properly, in the late 1700s/ early 1800s, fancy fonts with serifs and curls were all the rage, making it even harder to feel what the letters were.</p>
<p>Eventually, braille was adapted by a blind kid (at a school for the blind) from a military code using dots, so soldiers could leave secret messages for each other (I think!). The kid simplified it and it became the foundation of braille.</p>
<p>So braille is easier to learn, and easier to feel the difference between letters than the visual alphabet sighted people are used to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fingers have a limit to their precision. This limit isn't a hard one, but it does prevent you from efficiently reading small letters. Braille uses dots, which allows each individual dot to be much easier to recognize by touch than the shape of letters. For instance, an R vs a B, or a Q vs an O. This allows for smaller text.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Take 2 similar letters, like capital R and capital B Just by feeling them, it can be hard to distinguish them. Put this in with multiple characters, and they’re much harder to tell apart. While dots are easier to distinguish.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much everything has been mentioned already. Ease of reading, ease of producing, the fact that braille contractions exist in most countries.</p>
<p>Braille displays, which are the devices hooked to computers, phones and other such things, are able to instantly display a line of braille characters by raising dots up and down in cells. These devices are expensive, a common price is somewhere between 3k and 6k, but can be invaluable in some areas. I couldn't do my work as a blind programmer without one.</p>
<p>There's certainly disadvantages to doing it the way it's been done, braille characters for punctuation and non-standard Latin letters can often differ from country to country, and obviously someone who doesn't know braille because they don't need to know it (people who can see) can't read braille. In that sense, braille is a writing standard, not a language.</p>
<p>I myself cannot very easily recognize letters even if I've touched them before, I never learned their shapes and the fact that fonts exist make it more difficult by an order of magnitude to recognize letters, especially if they are particularly tiny. Braille characters are generally quite a bit larger than print letters, making them the same size would make them unrecognizable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
