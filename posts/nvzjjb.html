		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They did rot, but because of how they are layered on the roof, it sheds water pretty efficiently (that's how they didn't rot quickly, water shedding ability and tight layering protecting lower layers) and a well thatched roof in modern times can last 50 years before it's beyond use. Historically, at least in parts of England, a new layer of thatch was added to the aging/weathered layer and some houses have been found to have seven feet of thatch on them with the oldest layers being 500 years old.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Present tense, not past. Some of the thatched buildings in my village are 400+ years old and itâ€™s not a particularly old village. Here most people get their thatch replaced every 25 years or so, but you can just get it spruced up a bit rather than replacing the whole lot at once.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thatched roofs use things like straw because they have an incredibly large C:N ratio. So the high carbon and low nitrogen make it slow decaying. Hence straw lasting so long</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
