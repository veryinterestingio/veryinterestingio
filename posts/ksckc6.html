		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the internet is the set of connections between various computers.</p>
<p>compare it to the network of roads in your country.</p>
<p>you can block all roads leading to one specific city (&quot;Facebook-town&quot;, &quot;Google-city&quot;, whatever), but simply blocking one or two will generally only make that destination a bit harder to reach but not remove it from the map.</p>
<p>to completely shutdown all roads/the internet you'd need to cut all connections and in the case of the internet thats not just cables but also wireless (satellite) connections, making it virtually impossible to really shut it down 100%.</p>
<p>but in both cases cutting of some high-traffic/central destinations will lead to chaos and upheaval.</p>
<p>to lose ALL archives you'd need to destroy all harddrives connected to the internet, but a lot of stuff is just on a few harddrives, so if you destroyed 20% of all harddrives something like 10% of all content could be lost forever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>internet is a network. Contrary to what some people seem to think of it, it's not &quot;in one place&quot;. It's the grouping of many computer working together. And when I say computer, I don't mean &quot;a dozen computer placed around the world&quot;, I mean literally every computer that is connected to it become a part of it. Internet is the biggest network of all. The one biggest network that regroup the majority of computer devices.</p>
<p>To shut it down, you would need to either completely remove or destroy the infrastructure that allow computer to work together. The archives on the internet are not somewhere, they're everywhere. Every computer hold some information that belong to it. Wikipedia has its own server that hold whatever is on wikipedia, facebook has its own server that own these info etc etc. Cutting them from the internet wouldn't make you &quot;lose the archive&quot;, but rather they would be unavailable through the internet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While what people are saying here is correct, the vast, vast majority of the internet is simply consuming content rather than hosting it. And things are getting more and more centralized by the day. So even though it is effectively impossible to &quot;shut down&quot; the entire internet, taking down a few data centers owned by Amazon, Microsoft and Google is going to have a massive impact, so much so that it will effectively be dead for the average user.</p>
<p>There is also a bit of nuance between definitions of the internet and &quot;the web&quot;, and I suspect you are mostly talking about the latter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Slightly less technical - but still true! If a large Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) hit earth, it has the potential to knock out the internet and all radio and other electrical transmission lines for a prolonged period of time. The last time this happened was 1859, and then it only took out telegram transmissions as that was all that existed. If it happened now it would be catastrophic. A strong CME occurred in 2012, but luckily the earth was not in the right location to be effected. If the CME had happened 9 days later it would have hit us. Some scientists hypothesize that it could have taken out the internet worldwide for 12-18 months.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
