		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of those biological responses, evolved in a rough survival environment where you might not have the luxury of stopping to tend to a damaged or broken bone or muscle. If you hurt yourself running from a predator, you might still have some more running to do! Part of swelling is just a side effect of healing - delivering white blood cells and platelets where they're needed and stuff like that - but a big purpose of swelling is to promote immobilization of the affected parts, so that further force and movement don't make the injury worse or interrupt healing. But if we know how to immobilize an injury with a cast or splint, and if as a society we protect and care for our wounded so they can rest, what our body does might be an overreaction. Excessive swelling can cause blood vessel damage and edema, and mess with tissue elasticity, and other bad things. In a more dangerous natural environment, that might've been a more worthwhile tradeoff.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some swelling is good and desired for the healing. But too much swelling can damage the area or other areas near. If a wound area get really swollen, it can force the would to open. Swollen airways can block your breathing. Swelling internal organs can cause all sorts of problems. Swelling of brain can damage the brain.  </p>
<p>Swelling is a normal and natural mechanism with a purpose. Just like fever is normal and natural. But you can get such a high fever that you die to it, it causes so much stress and damage to your system.  </p>
<p>Allergic reaction is the body using the good and normal mechanisms, but they are too aggressive.   </p>
<p>Everything in moderation, even body's biological reactions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's break down what swelling is <em>exactly</em>.</p>
<p>The inflammatory response is how your immune system heals you. Inflammation hurts, though, so it is often viewed negatively despite it being a good thing you need right now. When something is inflamed, a handful of processes are happening all at once. The inflamed area swells up to help immobilize the wound, white blood cells are rushed to the area to fight infection, red blood cells are sent to provide oxygen, and platelets are sent to clot and stop the bleeding.<br />
If you've ever noticed an infected area is red and hot to the touch -- as previously stated, more blood is being pumped to that area making the temperature rise. Swollen areas are also often hot to the touch for the same reason.<br />
Now I'm sure you've noticed that once the swelling starts to subside the pain tends to go with it, right? That's because the pain is <em>caused</em> by the swelling. So we reduce swelling as a method of pain relief -- which is why ibuprofen and other NSAIDs reduce swelling (Non-Steroidal <em>Anti-Inflammatory</em> Drugs).</p>
<p>Often, when an infection occurs, a doctor will prescribe two forms of medication: an NSAID, and an antibiotic. One is to fight the pain caused by inflammation (by <em>inhibiting</em> inflammation entirely), while the other is used to fight the infection.</p>
<p>I hope this helps!</p>
<p>Obligatory thank-you-for-the-silver edit!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Inflammation is a natural response to disease or injury and produces a group of symptoms (fever, redness, swelling, heat, pain) that can be seen as detrimental to our daily activities.</p>
<p>With our modern understanding of medicine, first aid and self-care we know that swelling for example, isn't necessary to protect the injured area because we can do that ourselves through avoiding use.</p>
<p>Anti-inflammatories are therefore used to reduce the negative side effects of inflammation</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL:DR, if you sprain your ankle, inflammation is your friend. If you have septic shock, it's going to kill you.</p>
<p>Actually, a lot of the conventional wisdom has changed on reducing swelling specifically for minor soft-tissue injuries. The 'I' in 'RICE' mnemonic is no longer recommended (rest, ice, compression, elevation) because icing injured areas are actually deterring the injured tissue from receiving the nourishing blood flow that actually brings healing. </p>
<p>Icing and reducing inflammation can be helpful in catastrophic inflammation, such as auto-immune diseases, cytokine storms (such as the Spanish Flu pandemic and even the inflammatory phase of COVID-19), so these concepts are somewhat disease-specofoc. </p>
<p>This post is not medical advice. Please reach out to a trained physician to consult on whether to ice a wound or reduce inflammation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
