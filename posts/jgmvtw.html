		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>PhD student studying memory here! Like others have said, we don’t exactly know what happens when you try to retrieve a memory, much less a faint one (hence why I have a job trying to figure it out). </p>
<p>That being said, we do have some ideas! As some people have mentioned, there is evidence that as we try to remember something, various regions of the brain that are active when you experience something are re-activated as you try to retrieve it, and that re-activation is stronger as you are more confident in your recollection of the memory. So, if you’re remembering something visual, visual cortex in your occipital lobe will be active. There also is evidence that there is representation of memories elsewhere in the brain such as the parietal lobe, and that these representations are transformed in some way (so it’s not exactly the same as what was going on when you experienced it). Also, as memories (particularly episodic memories) get more remote, they tend to get semanticized. For example, if you try to remember your birthday party from this past year, you might be able to re-experience it pretty faithfully, but if you think about one of your birthday parties as a kid, you might remember facts about it like gifts that you received or the color of the frosting on your cake, but you wouldn’t necessarily experience it like you did a more recent memory. </p>
<p>As you remember some cues to do with the memory, other things get activated. Sometimes they’re things that are semantically related (think that you’re trying to remember the name of someone’s pet dog, the concept of wolves might be activated cause they’re also dog-like animals) or episodically related (like, you’re trying to remember the name of the person you just met, but you also remember how in that interaction, you were a klutz and spilled your coffee). As more and more of this evidence builds up, your hippocampus (which does lots of memory stuff) does what we call pattern completion, where it takes some small bits of the memory and tries to fill it in to have a whole experience. Sometimes, it’s successful and you can get the whole memory back, and sometimes it’s less successful. </p>
<p>There is also some psychological research that suggests that memory is supported by two systems - storage strength (how well it’s in there, doesn’t actually fade) and retrieval strength (how easy it is to access it - this can get worse as you don’t access a memory). The ventromedial prefrontal cortex is thought to play a pretty big role in the retrieval processes. You also get activity in the parietal cortex that is responsible for your confidence in a memory and is actually relatively independent from the strength of the memory itself (and can be manipulated!). </p>
<p>But yeah, ;tldr, lots of stuff, we don’t really know!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I also wonder about that thing where you're actively trying to remember something, like a name, and after a good long think you're like &quot;eh, it'll come to me&quot;. </p>
<p>And the next day while you're making a sandwich your brain goes &quot;BRIAN STEVENSON!&quot;. Does the brain just keep ticking in the background? do I have to have the intent of still wanting to know this information? (like I haven't given up)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Majored in this but have not used it in a while. No one really knows. Has a bit to do with plasticity, how you encoded the information, and with degradation of neural pathways. So if your brain encoded the information improperly or weirdly, it may be difficult to recall. If you haven’t accessed it in some time, a type of pruning might occur in which those pathways to the information or memory will “deteriorate”. Since you don’t use it your brain is passively degrading the path. Trying to pull it up is going to be difficult. Honestly you can think about it like trying to drive to a place where the roads have deteriorated and sometimes there’s not a clear path to the destination or rest of the road. Hopefully this helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most honest answer is, &quot;No one knows.&quot;</p>
<p>The human brain is the most complex and mysterious piece of matter in the known universe. The chicken brain would be the most complex and mysterious piece of matter in the known universe, except for all the other brains more complex than chicken brains.</p>
<p>Do chickens &quot;try to retrieve&quot; very faint memories? Perhaps they do, but how could we possibly know that?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
