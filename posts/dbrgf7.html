		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The information about Chaucer and <em>The Canterbury Tales</em> is correct. It also comes with another contributing factor. <em>The Canterbury Tales</em> was a <em>very</em> widely distributed book for its time, and part of that is that it coincided with the invention of the Gutenburg printing press. </p>
<p>The tiny letters used in printing presses are made of soft metals, and they wear out pretty quickly from all the smushing. A capital I lasts longer than lowercase i with its tiny dot and itty bitty line. So adopting this grammar rule was useful to printers in a pragmatic way with the capital I being far more readable for longer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the late 1300's Chaucer wrote <em>The Canterbury Tales</em> and he made the I slightly larger. After that, the capitalized 'I' became standard. Though there is no hard and fast rule on i, English is the only language to do it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a real rule. Sometimes pronouns can be proper nouns. &quot;I&quot; is one such pronoun. Another example is if you refer to your mother as &quot;Mom&quot; instead of her name, that &quot;Mom&quot; is now a proper noun.  </p>
<p>Edit: didn't realize what sub I was in. In five year old terms: When the i is by itself, he always wears his tall hat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simple answer: Yes, capitalizing the pronoun 'I' is a rule and not doing so will absolutely cost you points on graded/marked schoolwork.</p>
<p>English doesn't have rules written by some government organization but it has &quot;standards&quot; enforced mostly by tradition (e.g., see the arguments about using &quot;they&quot; as a singular, gender-neutral pronoun). However, English as taught in school has rules, including this one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
