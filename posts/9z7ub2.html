		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To give it in an actual eli5: depression not only makes you sad but also makes your body feel weak. Your brain doesn't make enough 'happy pods' so that makes you sad and when you are sad your body says &quot;well I don't want to do this, I want to lay in bed where I feel safe and maybe I'll feel better that way&quot; almost like when you get sick and your bodies natural response is to sleep it off for a while. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its called executive dysfunction. Its a very common symptom of depression. </p>
<p>Basically you know what you need to do. You know the steps to do it. But the lever your brain needs to pull to get the steps started (executed) is out of order. </p>
<p>Therapy helps by training people with executive dysfunction on how to break tasks down into very small manageable steps to bypass that executive lever. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Prob can’t explain it scientifically but my therapist was trying to help me understand it and he said “you know how when you have the flu and you feel so out of it all you wanna do is lay in bed and do nothing? Then imagine people telling you to “just get up and get over it”...that really put it in perspective for me.</p>
<p>*I don’t have depression </p>
<p>Edit wow thank you everyone for your honest replies. Not having depression I can only imagine how difficult it must be!  Thank you for helping me see a better picture of what depression is like. If you struggle you’re not alone!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

You would be exhausted beyond belief. Plus, you couldn’t escape- as the intimate person insulting you is yourself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>let’s say you need good cookies to keep going on with life. When all the ingredients (neurotransmitters) are perfect, that’s a good cookie and you are happy! You keep on baking to good cookies. </p>
<p>When some ingredients in the cookie are off like too much sugar or not enough chocolate now the cookie taste bad and this is when you get sad/mad/anxious/things get harder to do. You keep going but something is off. Then you start making terrible cookies and many people quit trying and just deal. Others will try even harder to get it right like more exercise or hang out with friends!</p>
<p>Just like your taste in cookies changes over time. The right combination of ingredients changes over time and also changes due to other factors. Ever feel stressed out and just crave that double fudge chocolate cookie when you normally like oatmeal? </p>
<p>Antidepressants can be seen as cookie mix. Some people just can’t make a good cookie no matter how hard they try. Others may just need a little help with the recipe. But not every cookie mix fits everyone’s tastes so it might take awhile to find the right one</p>
<p>I realize I went off topic. Now I want some cookies</p>
<p>Edit: WOW my first gold! Thank you so much!!</p>
