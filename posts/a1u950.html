		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I agree that it's weird but I saw a diagram in a Roman Ruins type museum that explained it.</p>
<p>If a Roman villa is abandoned because the owner died or the whole region was murdered in a war or whatever, eventually wind and rain would break the roof. Or if the villa was abandoned <em>because</em> the roof broke. That fills up the inside of the house with wooden beams and leaves and twigs and stuff. And the outside of the house gets mud and leaves blown up against it. Eventually these leaves rot into mud, the wind blows in seeds and plants start to grow, from this point it's self sustaining because now there's plants growing right on top of the house, in the kitchen and in the bedrooms etc. So more leaves and more mud.</p>
<p>Eventually it's too much mud to see the building anymore and someone plants a field of crops on top. Remember, Roman Ruins are generally only a couple of feet down not hundreds of feet so it doesn't need to be a lot of mud.</p>
<p>What I don't understand, however, is how a well made Roman villa gets abandoned in the first place. Unless every for miles is dead or already living somewhere substantially nicer wouldn't some squatters move in and fix the leaky roof and repaint it etc. But thats a problem I have will all history from that era. Imagine being a 7th Century farmer in Florence or Rome, you lead your cart of turnips down a perfectly smooth roman stone road and sit in the shadow of the massive Colosseum with absolutely 0 idea how they were built and quite content that no one for a thousand miles around can fix the aquaduct if it breaks. How does a society just lose all that knowledge and go from flushing toilets to pooping in a bucket and throwing it out the window? Maybe there were entertaining mushrooms growing everywhere and the people were just dumb? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ancient civilizations often used older existing structures as foundations to the structures they were building. Fast forward a couple thousand years of this and the oldest structures have been repeatedly collapsed, filled in, and used as foundations for the next generation of building. This was a way to save time, resources, and labor when you had smaller populations with fewer resources which made carving stones, baking bricks, digging new foundations, etc much harder</p>
<p>In post modern times we tend to remove and recycle/destroy older structures instead of filling them in and building on top of. This is partly due to our society culture/standards, but also the modern materials we use and the needs for deeper and more sturdy foundations due to increased height, size, and weight of our structures</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One more extreme method that has buried buildings of the past and present is volcanic activity.  A volcanic mudslide (lahar), an avalanche of hot ash (pyroclastic flow), or just ash falling out of the sky can bury buildings.  Pompeii is a famous victim of a pyroclastic flow and it's neighbor Herculaneum fell victim to a lahar.  There are cities that have been buried by volcanic activity in the past 100 years and are the most likely examples of modern architecture to survive for archeologists of the future to find.  Modern society has a habit of tearing down buildings that are abandoned or no longer useful.  </p>
<p>Other possible buildings to survive are those in remote and cold places like Antarctic and those intentionally built to last a long time like bunkers and nuclear waste disposal areas.  All things considered, we're going to leave an eclectic selection of buildings behind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a pedantic nitpick, but the proper term here is &quot;soil.&quot; </p>
<p>Dirt is displaced soil. Dirt can be found under your fingernails or tracked into your house. But if it's outside, it's still soil. </p>
<p>Ok, answers: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where does all this dirt come from and how long does it take to build up? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Soil comes from all around us. It's made of rocks, minerals, living stuff, and dead stuff. It stacks up over time. It will stack up faster depending on the nature around it. Many times it's by water because humans like water and tend to live around water. Soil moved and deposited is called &quot;sediment.&quot; A lot of lost buildings and objects are due to water moving soil around. It's kinda natural because once the building has been flooded with soil, people tend to either move away or build on top of the flooded spot. It's easier than digging the old building out. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>When will different things from our time end up buried? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This can be answered by the next question. But short answer is if we stop upkeep on our buildings or let nature take course, anything that's not a stone or plastic structure will likely degrade and fade away into history. Even metal structures will rust away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do some buildings (ex: some castles) seem to avoid this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People. It's because of people. Castles tend to have some upkeep. These castles are constantly inhabited and the people there will try to keep the dirt and soil out of their home. Most castles are built somewhere high and away from elements that allow soil and sediment to accumulate. This is a defensive measure as it's harder to attack a fortress on a hill.</p>
<p>What about the ones buried? Back to the elements. If they were built too high or near a mountain, the mountain can have debris flow and cover the castle. </p>
<p>What about underwater? Well, then some sort of ecological change has happened. Either the nearby body of water has decided to flow and submerge the building, or that the rising ocean has reclaimed the structure. This happens due to poor surveying and general builder's arrogance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of natural burial is just dust and dirt from the wind (water can bring dirt too, if there is surface runoff).  Add some vegetation and you get more debris that keeps adding to the surface.  Rubble from collapsed buildings or walls (like vegetation) are natural windbreaks so cause a lot of the suspended particles being carried in the wind to drop and bury whatever is on the ground (the ground &quot;tries&quot; to reach a smooth condition).  Low areas fill in, and high areas erode down.</p>
<p>Not everywhere gets buried, lots of places actually get eroded away, but of course that means that they no longer exist to be found.  We only find places that got buried.</p>
<p>Huge structures like castles haven't gotten buried or eroded yet.  Too big for that. Eventually it would or will happen.  Just like the mountains end up as plains, eventually.  Just a question of how much time is needed.  Big, strong structures need a lot of time to get broken down and buried.</p>
<p>There are some places that exist as prominent mounds or small hills.  Those often are piles of rubble that dirt filled in and around, and eventually on top of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
