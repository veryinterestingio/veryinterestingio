Seemingly the farthest “out to sea” you could have ever been on this planet is while Pangea was just formed (unless there were other land masses on the other side of the planet). </p>
<p>Do we know what the ocean was like at the farthest point from land back then?
Where would that point be now in relation to current continent placement? Or would it have long since subducted away?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pangea was the super-continent, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panthalassa" target="_blank">Panthalassa</a> was the super-ocean. We don't know a <em>whole</em> lot about it since its oceanic crust has pretty much been entirely subducted, but we do know it had some volcanic island chains and some small bits of continental crust. We know these because sea floor spreading (during the early formation of Pangaea, and later the beginning of the Pacific Ocean) caused many of these features to become part of Pangaea's coasts. The size of the ocean suggests that the currents were simple and slow, and the temperature was fairly warm, so much of it probably looked a lot like the middle of the South Pacific today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if there would be <em>any</em> life present at the furthest point from land during the existence of Pangea.  The ocean isn't homogenously populated with life.  It's not like you can go to any part of the ocean and find fish there.  The ocean has &quot;desserts&quot; and &quot;forests&quot; just like the land does, and whether a particular part of the ocean is nutrient rich or nutrient poor depends largely on ocean currents.  As the earth spins, the water resists this spin, causing it to &quot;move&quot; in the opposite direction from the land mass rotating on the bottom.  It also diverts, either up or down, away from the equator.  This is known as the coriolis effect.  Probably nothing mind blowing here.  Anyway, if there were no land on the planet, this wouldn't do anything particularly interesting, but the existence of land causes the currents to divert around it, forming big circular whirlpools called gyres.</p>
<p>Depending on the direction of rotation of the gyre, it could either be &quot;piling&quot; water up in the middle of the gyre, or &quot;sucking&quot; water out of the middle of the gyre.  Whichever thing is happening in the middle, the opposite is happening at the gyre's edges, closer to the land.  In places where the water is being pulled away, deeper water rises up to replace it, resulting in &quot;upwelling&quot; that brings nutrients that have sunk to the bottom up to the surface.  If the water is piling up, then that extra water sinks, forcing nutrients down and making the surface nutrient poor and unable to support large populations of living things.</p>
<p>In our current world, the pacific gyres dump water into their middles, resulting in &quot;nutrient desserts&quot; where virtually nothing lives.  However, the pacific coasts, where upwelling is happening, are absolutely crawling with life.  In the north Atlantic, we see the other thing happening, where water is being pulled away from the center of the gyre, resulting in massive populations of fish, marine mammals, etc. being able to be supported there in the open ocean.  In the world of Pangea, there would only be one big ocean, which means there are just two big gyres.  If those gyres are rotating the wrong way, then pretty much everything living would be near the Pangean coasts, and the ocean surface deep out to sea would be almost empty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Triassic-Period/Paleoclimate" target="_blank">I found this a fascinating and easy read on the topic</a> </p>
<p>The ocean, Panthalassa, stretched pole to pole and was twice as wide, at the equator, as the Pacific is today. Some of the question may have to be at what point - Pangea came about at the time of the 3rd (and largest) mass extinction event. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, 85 to 95 percent of marine invertebrate species became extinct at the end of the Permian.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ocean currents are believed to have been mild, which may have contributed to lower oxygen levels in the ocean. </p>
<p>Then, again the end of the Triassic isn’t so good, as it was met with another mass extinction (though not as severe) </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Intense volcanic activity associated with the breakup of Pangea is thought to have raised carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere and increased the acidity of the oceans. Since this volcanism coincided with the beginning of the end-Triassic extinction, it is considered by many paleontologists to be the extinction’s most likely cause.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.sci-news.com/paleontology/science-toxic-panthalassa-end-triassic-mass-extinction-02663.html" target="_blank">More recently, a study has come out that may shed more direct light in your question</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>have found strong evidence for a condition called marine photic zone euxinia (PZE) as a globally important extinction mechanism for the end-Triassic extinction, also called Triassic-Jurassic extinction (201.3 million years ago).</p>
<p>PZE occurs when the sun-lit surface waters of the ocean become devoid of oxygen and are poisoned by hydrogen sulfide – a by-product of microorganisms that live without oxygen that is extremely toxic to most other life forms.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because sea floor crust is more dense, it tends to subduct underneath continental crust and be recycled back into the mantle on a regular basis. This means the existing sea floor at any point in time is not very old. Currently, the oldest sea floor that survives is about 180 million years old, which is just about the time that Pangea was breaking up.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mcSddNFxrEE/UOdPpq346RI/AAAAAAAAAXA/vWtuFoIPyI4/s1600/Earth_seafloor_crust_age_1996.gif" target="_blank">Here's a map of sea floor age reconstructed based on magnetic reversals</a>. You can see the oldest sea floor in dark blue off the coasts of Africa and eastern North America that formed as Pangea split apart. There's also very old sea floor to the east of the Mariana Trench. This sea floor would have been formed at a spreading center somewhere in the middle of the great ocean named Panthalassa during the late Pangea period.</p>
<p>All the rest of the sea floor that was once under Panthalassa is gone now. It's been subducted underneath the plates that surround the modern Pacific Ocean. Because that old sea floor material remains cooler and denser even as it travels through the mantle, it's possible to detect it using seismic tomography and reconstruct its outline deep in side the Earth, as in <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Farallon_Plate.jpg" target="_blank">this reconstruction of the subducted Farallon Plate underneath modern North America</a>.</p>
<p>While there's a lot of uncertainty, the best supported reconstructions of the sea floor of Panthalassa have it made up of three or four oceanic plates which are all now almost entirely subducted. This includes the previously mentioned Farallan Plate in the northeast, the Kula Plate in the north, the Phoenix Plate in the south, and possibly the Izanagi Plate in the northwest. There would have been mid ocean ridges (spreading centers) and transform faults at the boundaries of all of these plates, similar the modern ridge in the middle of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>As for what was on the now gone plates, it's hard to know for sure. They were oceanic, so there wasn't any lost continents, but they probably did carry island arcs from hotspots and divergence and possibly older episodes of subduction. All of this would have looked a lot like what we see in the Pacific Ocean today. Some of this oceanic mass got scraped off of the plates as they subducted under the continental plates. This accreted material became part of the margin of the continental plates and can still be seen today. For example, <a href="https://people.wou.edu/~brownk/ES104/ES104.2007.1127.MountainBuilding_files/slide0027_image051.jpg" target="_blank">along the western side of North America</a>. These &quot;exotic terranes&quot; are the remnants of land (and under sea mounts) that used to be far out in Panthalasssa.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the Pangea era, a whole new plate emerged right in the middle of where the Farallan, Kula, and Phoenix plates met. This plate became the Pacific Plate and makes up most of the Pacifc Ocean's floor today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Much the sea floor during the Pangea era subducted, at least the parts that were furthest from the super-continent. We can make some guesses based on fossils from that era, but the full picture is pretty much lost to time. There is no reason to expect the ultra distant ocean was significantly different from other parts of the sea floor at that time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
