		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Collective bargaining agreement. The workers instead of negotiating wages and benefits individually join a union, they all are working together, and a spokesperson for all the workers tries to negotiate better terms for all the workers. For their actions, they of course get paid from the union dues each employee pays. Some unions do well and represent their workers amd protect them from stupidity and pettiness of employers. Others do  nothing but collect dues an maybe get you a quarter raise next year and and bad dental plans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked as a union steward for five years so my position's biased for sure, bear that in mind.</p>
<p>A Union's there to protect the workers.  Not by getting those employees out of any bullshit they pull but to make sure that the agreement they crafted through negotiation with management, intended to represent all covered workers, is adhered to.</p>
<p>In effect your Union will negotiate a Collective Bargaining Agreement that will cover pay, disciplinary procedures, scheduling methods, work hours, responsibilities, time off, so on and so forth.  They're generally pretty robust documents.  Our CBA was around 700 pages long.</p>
<p>Usually your Union will necessarily have a steward who will act to represent you if something goes wrong.  Say you're doing your work and something catastrophic happens, and management tries to say you're responsible.  The Steward's supposed to step in and tell them to provide evidence and follow the disciplinary procedure or fuck right off.  They'll usually require management prove its case through grievance procedures by providing evidence that satisfies the burden assigned them by that same CBA.</p>
<p>If it really was your fault and management carries their burden the Union won't be able to do much to help you, but that's not the point.  The point is to make sure you're getting treated fairly and to the expected standard, and that everyone else is too.</p>
<p>Edit: And yeah they'll charge dues.  Ours helped pay for my time researching and representing my Union members and negotiating contractual fuck-ups that occurred by either management or members.  They also went to activities to try to draw up some Union support as often once the CBA is established members don't want to be that involved, which means the Union ends up lacking leadership and eventually crumbles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Trouble is - getting there is tough, as the employer will fight to prevent organising, fire advocates and in past times kill union people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
