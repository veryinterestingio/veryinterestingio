		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blaze orange gear is required in most states during deer hunting season to prevent hunting accidents. This works out okay because deer are colorblind and do not notice the orange clothing. Other types of hunting either do not require blaze orange (like turkey hunting) or are the type of hunting when the animals seeing you in advance doesn't really matter (like pheasant hunting).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First I’d like to say camouflage is not so much about “blending in” as it is about breaking apart shapes/lines. I know you didn’t exactly ask this but it’s a common topic so I figured I’d mention it. This is why some modern digital-style patterns  with light colour can be much harder to see than the traditional camo pattern, even with a human eye at 100yds. A dark blob is just easier to see than a lighter figure that melts into the surrounding foliage. </p>
<p>Now,  if we’re hunting deer for example, a majority of the colours they are picking up are just different shades of grey. (Think black &amp; white). The blaze orange is purely for hunter safety in high volume areas, and mandatory in some states. That being said, to some extent the contrast between the colours can be a give away. Perfect example is sitting in a tree stand with your face uncovered, it will essentially look like a giant pie plate to the animals. The rest of you may be broken apart and harder to distinguish, but they still pick up fast/sudden movements very easily as well. </p>
<p>Worth noting that if you’re looking to get into hunting, scent control/wind management and general expertise will always prevail over fancy camouflage. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Inside your eye are two distinct... &quot;things&quot; that help with vision. They are rods and cones. Rods don't see color well and have mediocre spacial acuity (ability to tell difference between two objects.) Cones are to help you see colors and give you the ability to see spaces between objects (think reaching out to grab a can of coke) the cones see different wavelengths of light. Short and middle wavelength cones are seen as blues and greens respectively. Long wavelength is responsible for red and oranges. Deer simply lack the equipment in their eyes to see the long wavelength and interpret it the way that we do. To put it another way think of a dog whistle, your dog can hear it but you cannot. This is another topic that I can explain if you would like. But as other people stated the purpose of the orange is so that other hunters can see you more easily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
