<p>i study chemistry so i know the basic principle of soap: non-polar tail with polar head so micelles with dirt and stuff can be removed.
so i'm wondering how different soaps differ from each other</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I only know the cleaning part, not the chemistry part, so add your understanding to my explanation... Dish soap is formulated primarily for cutting grease, and has high sudsing. Household cleaners are formulated for cleaning particles like dirt, and use acid to break down minerals. They are low sudsing. Laundry detergent is a detergent which means it uses enzymes to lift/digest proteins like body soil, as well as lifting grease. Medium suds. Dishwasher detergent is very similar but has a higher ratio of grease cutting to enzymes, and also has the acid component. Low suds. So all the household cleaners could theoretically be interchangeable, but they just won't do as good a job at a task they were not formulated to do. This is why I wash my clothes and my floors with Tide, but I don't use it in my dishwasher. I wash dishes in my sink with Dawn, and I wash my greasy dog with it, but I don't use it in my laundry.</p>

<p>Some soaps for wooden floors and furniture will have additional chemicals to add sheen and protection to surfaces.</p>
<p>Soaps for dishes are made so small amounts will not harm people when ingested, but made to completely strip fat away from dishes made from glass, ceramic or plastics.</p>
<p>Using dish soap could strip away oils on wooden furniture and damage the natural surface and material over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So soap is more of a 'fat' product. Soap is made up of a fat and an alkali. So a triglyceride is joined with a sodium or potassium hydroxide. When joined it leaves the glycerin behind and the new product is the &quot;soap&quot; which acts as a surfactant that bubbles and basically attracts grease and dirt which takes it off the surface you are cleaning. Soap is much more gentle and more &quot;natural&quot; than detergent. Detergent is a fully synthetic product which is derived from something like a petroleum. It has a similar reaction in that you end up with a surfactant.</p>
<p>Now the mention of glycerin above is important. Detergent does not have glycerin as a byproduct. Glycerin is a slippery substance that allows skin to maintain it's oils. Detergent is a skin irritant because of this lack of glycerin. This is why we need to use conditioner and lotion, because so many liquid &quot;soaps&quot; are actually gentle detergents and not actually soap. </p>
<p>Below is a really good source that will explain this whole topic more in depth. </p>
