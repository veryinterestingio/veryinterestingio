		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends which one you are referring to! As a very general statement- they can inhibit the markers that cause your nerves to communicate across the nervous system. Therefore less transmission between nerves. Less seizures :)  </p>
<p>This is why drowsiness is a common side effect with these meds- as it is slowing down the firing of your nerves :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They block &quot;sodium channels&quot; and inhibit nerve cells from releasing Aspartat and Glutamat. That basically slows down the chain reaction of signals being transmitted.</p>
<p>Epileptic seizures happen when a nerve chainreaction starts to cascade out of control, so slowing them down makes seizures more rare or even prevents them entirely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kinda off topic, but curious to know about you all. </p>
<p>I am epileptic as well, and suffered from a seizure a year ago, very violent (both shoulders dislocated). </p>
<p>I've been extremely on edge about getting another seizure since then. Do any of you have the same problem and so, what do you do about the fear? Cuz at this point it is becoming a problem for me. I'm getting help for it already, but talking to people with the same problem can't hurt right?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure today's 5 year olds would get this, but maybe 80's and 90's... Anyway.</p>
<p>Think of the brain like a lightbright. When you put the pegs in the right places you can see a picture. The brain is the same, when working right it can think of things, move your body, etc.</p>
<p>Now imagine you put a peg in every hole on the lightbright. No image, just a lot of jarring colors. That's a seizure, the whole brain is working at once, so no correct information is getting where it needs to. Some times you get a lot of random movements, sometimes people just kind of zone out for a minute.</p>
<p>Anti-seizure meds make it harder for the brain to work so that only the real messages are created. In my lightbright example, it would be like if I put a few sheets of paper over the screen. Sure you can still put a peg in every hole, but it takes much more effort, so why not do less work and only put the pegs in to make a picture.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello! It depends on what drug is used since different medicines have different mechanisms of action.</p>
<p>We have to remember that seizures are hyper-excitable states. So anti-seizure drugs are designed to control the excitability or the spread of excitability in the brains of people who get seizures. There are channels in our brains called voltage-gated channels which can be targeted to control the excitability. On the other hand, there are drugs that can enhance the natural inhibitory mechanisms in our brain. Think of it like using the built in breaks in our brain to help slow it down. And there are other drugs that will affect how the neurotransmitters or the chemical messages are released. </p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
