<p>anyway, it still turns out that SO many times you play, and you end up so that there was only one single move left to finish that level. how is that designed? how does the game determine how to drop the pieces so you JUST lose in the end and are encouraged to use premium currency to continue?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These games aren't random. </p>
<p>Many of the components are intentionally designed to lock a portion of the board, forcing players to &quot;play the board&quot; until areas are &quot;free&quot;. This gives the player the illusion they have &quot;choice&quot; to &quot;clear&quot; a board when they really don't.</p>
<p>It's also why most board clears, once the developer has tried their best to extract cash from players, offers the highest points with the most rewards.</p>
<p>This psychological effect is why millions can't stop playing these types of games. They &quot;reward&quot; players into believing they have full control, but as long as the game throws out &quot;freebies&quot; such as &quot;unlimited lives&quot; and &quot;power boosts&quot;, players continue to repeat the pattern.</p>
<p>Most are completely unaware the game is rigged from the start. Even if they did know, I doubt they'd stop playing simply because most people play the game to kill time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pseudo Random. They most likely don't use a random number generator to choose what item (candy,...) Is going to appear next, but some sort of algorithm that takes in your current board (what items you have on screen), your passed moves and tried to predict your next moves, they run this algorithm on every possible item untill they find the one that has the highest probably of getting you where they want. The algorithm also most likely takes into account you as a person (how long you play, how much you spend an stuff) to influence the decision</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every level you played has finetuned so that the number of turns you have is 1-2 less than what the majority of population needs to finish. This makes the each play of the level be on that edge of either failing by 1 turn or passing it with 1-2 turns left max. </p>
<p>If you suck at the game you will always end up needing just a couple of turns to finish the level. Most players will try again, but some will pay just to skip frustration and that is what they count on to make money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can remember a time (2010 and shortly after) where I could just buy fishdom for my iPad for 2.99 and be done with it (still runs on my 1st gen iPad). That was the same with many other games at this time. But then someone came up with the &quot;free&quot; versions that actually demands money from players after level three or so and everything went to shit. Playrix joined this scheme as well.</p>
<p>Today it is impossible to find a mobile game that I can just buy for a modest amount of money and doesn't want more and more and more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
