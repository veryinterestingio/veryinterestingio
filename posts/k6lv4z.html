		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot of half responses and some questionable information in this thread. I have a PhD in immunology and am an expert in antigen presentation, the process the immune system uses to generate specific T and B cell responses.</p>
<p>Really what your question comes down to is &quot;Is natural immunity to a virus enough to protect you from subsequent infection.&quot; This varies depending on the virus, obvious examples are Chicken pox which produces life long immunity versus something like a common cold virus which produces little long term immunity (though there is a complication there in that common colds are caused by many different viruses but that point still stands).  While the differences in long term immunity to these viruses is not completely understood it really comes down to the generation of memory cells which are able to respond to the virus upon secondary infection. These come in two major flavors which have been in the news a lot lately, B cells: which produce antibodies, and T cells: which both help B cells in generating antibodies and kill virally infected cells.</p>
<p>Since I assume you want to know about Covid let's discuss that. First off, while yes there are reports of people becoming re-infected with Covid these reports are very infrequent and major studies on long term antibody responses and even memory T cell responses have pointed to natural infection generating a durable immune response. The length of this durability is unknown since the virus is so new, but I believe we are going to be talking about it lasting on the order of at least a year to years, not on the order of months. Everything we have seen so far is consistent with a typical viral immune response, including the decreasing antibody titer in the short term after the virus is cleared and the generation of memory T and B cells that can restart the response if you were to get re-infected to a level that overcomes your serum antibody titers. The early studies about waning antibody levels were very overstated and their conclusions way too broad when considered based on basic immunological principles.</p>
<p>So back to the question, would that person need the vaccine? The correct answer is eventually but we don't know when. Because of this to my knowledge prior infection will not be taken into account when giving vaccinations (which it shouldn't). In a perfect world you would prioritize vaccinating people who have not gotten infected naturally. This would greatly increase your immunity coverage in the population in the short term while vaccines are in a limited supply. However, due to the poor availability and accuracy of tests for this virus I don't think anyone would truly trust someone saying that they have had the virus before, meaning we are better off just vaccinating everyone based on our susceptibility criteria to make sure those people are immune.</p>
<p>There is no reason to think that giving the vaccine to someone who has already had the virus would be harmful, and I believe some people who received the vaccine in the completed clinical trials were previously infected but I'm not 100% certain about that.</p>
<p>The other important question is how long vaccine immunity will last and the reality there is we also don't know. Again, it will likely be long lasting and Moderna's three month data was very promising, but we won't know how long it will last until we get that far out from the first people being vaccinated. There is not necessarily any correlation between the natural immune response and the vaccine generated response in terms of how long it will last because vaccines will activate the immune system differently from how the virus itself does it.</p>
<p>Now this is all for infection with the same strain or at least a strain containing the same major antigen (in this case the spike protein). Everything would become very different if another strain of coronavirus were to evolve or a significant mutation of the spike protein were to occur. Vaccine immunity will be generated only to the spike protein while there will be some additional immunity to other parts of the virus from a natural infection. However, these responses may be suboptimal and may not completely neutralize the virus. There is also a concept of &quot;original antigenic sin&quot; (which is complex and has become more controversial recently) but generally the idea is that the first virus of a type you are infected with shapes the response to those types of viruses and this may actually prevent your immune system from generating an appropriate response to a second similar virus. Either way all of that is theoretical now and likely will not come into play during this pandemic due to this virus' low mutation rate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes yes, sometimes no.</p>
<p>When you are infected with any virus, the body will mount an immune response to ALL of the viral antigens.</p>
<p>Some of those antigens stimulate a protective response, which means that they protect you from getting infected again.</p>
<p>Many, if not most, of them stimulate an immune response which may not be protective.</p>
<p>Vaccines, however, are developed with antigens that ARE protective against getting re infected.  That is why vaccination is  good idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Semi-related, NEJM just posted data today showing that 119 days out from the 1st vaccination (90 days after the second), all of Moderna's patients still showed strong titers, but there were small decreases (me eyeballing it).</p>
<p><del>I'm a bit confused as I thought that Moderna only required 1 dose, but this mentions a ph1 trial, so the ph3 that was reported may have been only 1 dose. Any insight there would be appreciated.</del></p>

<p>Edit: I've been shown that all the lead candidates (Biontech, Oxford, and Moderna all require 2 doses). Learn something new every day!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
