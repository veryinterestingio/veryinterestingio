		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are generally a few reasons.  One of the biggest being that higher altitude means thinner atmosphere and less resistance on the plane. </p>
<p>There's also the fact that terrain is marked by sea level and some terrains may be much higher above sea level than the takeoff strip and they need to be able to clear those with a lot of room left over.</p>
<p>Lastly, another good reason is simply because they need to be above things like insects and most types of birds.</p>
<p>Because of the lower resistance, at higher altitudes, the plane can almost come down to an idle and stay elevated and moving so it also helps a lot with efficiency. </p>
<p>Edit:  Forgot to mention that weather plays its part as well since planes don't have to worry about getting caught up in the lower atmosphere where things like rain clouds and such form.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pilot here,</p>
<p>We can start by forgetting about piston aircraft that don't have any great benefits going above 10,000 feet compared to say 5,000 feet. </p>
<p>Turbo-prop aircraft (Q400 or ATR-72) usually cruise around 30,000 since they have a benefit of the prop biting into a bit of a thicker atmosphere vs. a higher and thinner atmosphere</p>
<p>Jet turbine aircraft (737, 320, Cseries) leans itself out as the go higher: air:fuel ratio becomes most efficient. A rich vs. a lean engine in a piston aircraft can go from a 12:1 air to fuel ratio to an 8:1 fuel ratio in a few thousand feet and usually cannot get better than that. </p>
<p>All other factors like greater fuel efficiency (fuel burns can be cut in half to 1/4 of lower alt. burns), drift-down time (Gimli glider), greater radio reception and radar guidance, obstacle avoidance, but mainly its turbine performance (concorde cruised at 60,000), not friction avoidance.</p>
<p>One misconception is the friction factor. A headwind of +5kt at a higher altitude will not outweigh the benefits of less friction at a greater altitude. Oxygen (atmosphere) drops off a lot after 12,000 ft.</p>
<p>I've changed cruising altitude from FL 19,000 to 13,000 ft to gain another 30 kts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thinner air actually makes an engine less efficient, but this is offset by increased airspeed in a turbojet engine due to an increase in ram air. A high bypass turbo fan or turboprop still loses efficiency due to the thinner air. Efficiency is primarily gained by the much much colder air temperatures at higher altitudes, which more than offsets the reduction in thrust due to less dense air. I canâ€™t recall exactly why this is but the lower temperature is the biggest reason turbine engines are best at high altitudes. </p>
<p>Also, because of the thinner air, for a given indicated airspeed, true airspeed (airspeed through an air mass) and subsequently groundspeed, increases as your altitude increases. In the end you go faster for less fuel as you get higher, up to a certain altitude. Then the temperature stops dropping and you run into increased costs to keep the cabin pressurized to below 10,000 feet. IIRC, this is somewhere in the 40,000 feet range. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ol>
<li>
<p>Stable air and weather avoidance. Less turbulence makes for a smoother ride and it would be cost and time prohibitive to fly around all the storms and wind shear at lower altitudes. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More efficient flying. Less strain on the engines, better aerodynamic performance, and the ability to catch a favorable air current (it's called the jet stream for a reason).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More altitude is better in terms of troubleshooting any problems. </p>
</li>
<li>The view is spectacular. </li>
</ol>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>u/stoplightrave us partially right. However, one reason no one has mentioned is that most want to travel as fast as possible.
