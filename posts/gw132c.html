<p>I understand that the mines detonate when a ship bumps into them, but how did the mines resist corrosion and still function?  Why were probes placed under the mine even though the ships were likely to travel above the mine?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Key point to be made here about the operation of the &quot;Hertz horn&quot; detonators --  They didn't have any &quot;moving parts&quot; so to speak. &quot;Ticking&quot; sea mines are a Hollywood embellishment, like land mines that don't detonate until you take your foot off them, or hand grenades with a ten-second fuse.</p>
<p>They were made of somewhat softer/thinner metal than the structural steel of the mine, and contained a glass vial of acid. <a href="https://www.navalhistory.org/2016/04/07/mine-over-matter" target="_blank">An impact between a massive ship and also rather heavy mine would deform the horn enough to let the acid pour over electrodes functioning as a battery to fire the detonator deeper inside</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>They had detonation horns all around them so there would be a chance they would be pulled up against the side of the ship even if a mine chain cutter was able to free them, or if a submarine passes under them. </p>
<p>Also if they were cut free they would become a free floating mine causing hazards in the immediate area (and sometime far ranging areas). I read a few years ago that there are still reports of free floating naval mines from WW2 and they can be active today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some were contact mines. Later, they used magnetic field detectors. Ships have their own magnetic fields and if it passes over a magnetic mine its magnetic field will cause the fuse to fire. This is also the reason why ships and submarines were regularly 'de-gaussed' (have their magnetic fields removed or altered). The problem with contact mines is that they generally need to be very shallow or at the surface and thus easily detectable and/or avoidable (if not running at night). Magnetic mines could be placed below the water line and cause explosions underneath the ship which are much more effective at causing damage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>they are made from special very rust ressistant steel and surface treated with anticorrosion coating or paint.</p>
<p>The triggers (called Hertz horns) are all around the mines because they are not only for ships but also submarines that could hit them from below. Not all mines have the Hertz horns all around though, some of them only had them on upper half.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well there are 2 types of mines. There are electromagnetic mines and contact mines. Contact mines are pretty easy to understand. You hit them, it’s like the primer on a bullet. Go boom.</p>
<p>Em mines had electromagnetic sensors in them, and when a large magnetic object got nearby, it would trigger the mine. Boom. Battleships in WW2 happen to be giant metal objects</p>
<p>Also, explosions in water are much worse than explosions on land. These would kill subs easily by crushing them. Think of it like this. When you walk down the steps into a swimming pool, you aren’t really tossed around, not a lot of pressure, when you are hit by an ocean wave of equal volume, it can knock you over, knock the wind out of you, or seriously injure you, without even touching the bottom or a rock or anything. When a mine goes off, there is a shockwave that is transmitted through the water, which disturbs the overall local density of water. When it tries to get back to its normal density, it’s a huge rush of pressure. Submarine goes pop. Less effective against ships in that way, contact mines help to damage the hull, usually sending shrapnel through the hull and springing a leak, or em mines can create a density “vacuum” disrupting the bouyancy of a steel ship, bring them under just enough to take on water. Swallow. Ship gone. </p>
<p>Fun fact, Germans set so many mines in the English Channel, that the British took large planes and equipped them with giant electromagnet hoops. These hoops would emit strong electromagnetic pulses into the water, exploding mines. The plane was above the water and unharmed by the mines. It allowed ships to pass safely. </p>
<p>Electromagnetic mines btw are the most effective mine type, Bc you could cover more area with fewer mines and still likely sink them</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
