		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Time and silence.  </p>
<p>For 13 years, almost all of the elite had to join the Nazi party.  In 1952, 25% of West Germans admitted to having a &quot;good opinion&quot; of Hitler.  In his first official address to the parliament, Chancellor Adenauer (in 1949) said &quot;The government of the Federal Republic, in the belief that many have subjectively atoned for a guilt that was not heavy, is determined where it appears acceptable to do so to put the past behind us.&quot;  The German government was generally determined to forget.  </p>
<p>In 1968, Germany had its own set of internal revolutions, where the baby boom children grew up and protested against the crimes of their fathers, so to speak.  This was helped along by the fact that the actual chancellor, the third in the history of West Germany, was himself a former Nazi and a party member from 1933-1945 who served under Ribbentrop.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Georg_Kiesinger#Early_life_and_Nazi_activities" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Georg_Kiesinger#Early_life_and_Nazi_activities</a></p>
<p>They made it illegal to continue to be a Nazi or to support Hitler, but for the most part, if you were a Nazi and said &quot;sorry about all that Nazi stuff&quot; the German government was fine with it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There were a lot of politicians the Nazis had arrested or removed from office.  The first leader of West Germany had spent time in a Nazi prison. The US and the Allies had a specific 'De-Nazification' program they used.  It included things like forcing Germans to visit the death camps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's an old German joke and the gist of it is &quot;Who were the Nazis&quot; and the punchline is &quot;someone else's grandfather.&quot;  The joke is that clearly many, many people's grandfathers were Nazis, but never yours!</p>
<p>It wasn't like everyone &quot;woke up&quot; and realized they'd been evil Nazis and stopped thinking those things, they just didn't have power any longer because they were literally destroyed by foreign armies.</p>
<p>They never stopped being Nazis they just lost the ability to be public Nazis.  Maybe some of them changed their minds after seeing the results of the war, maybe a lot did, but plenty didn't too and they didn't go anywhere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They don’t try and pretend it didn’t happen or that it was just a few ppl participating. They take full blame and teach how it was wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
