In the movie, he pushes a submarine out of the water at superspeed. One of us argues that the sudden change in pressure would destroy the submarine the other says different. Who is right and why? Thanks</p></div></div>

Submarines can surface from test depth at insane speeds without issue and do it yearly for testing purposes. The inside of the boat is pressurized and the change in depth would not cause any real problems. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Structural engineer here. A lot of people here don't understand how submarines are built. Water pressure is resisted by the strength of the hull, not by equalizing the pressure on the inside of the boat. Everyone would be crushed to death by that pressure. You can liken the forces to a body inside a large steel ring with an immense weight bearing on top of the ring. The strength of the ring is what keeps the weight from crushing the body. The rate at which you remove the weight from the ring will do nothing to harm the ring or the body. If you were to repeatedly load the ring and unload it, you might fatigue the steel. However, the one time rapid removal of force would cause no problems.  </p>
<p>Others have rightly pointed out some other physics problems with the movie. However, I believe the argument was over the rapid depressurizing of the submarine due to water pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To a first approximation, the change in pressure doesn't matter. The pressure vessel doesn't care. In lab testing we frequently cycle things between 0 and 10,000 psi in a minute or two because we don't feel like waiting around forever. Some things <em>on or in</em> the submarine might care, like ballast tanks or oil compensated components that can't move fluid around quickly enough to deal with the volume change.</p>
<p>A much more serious problem will be the forces involved. Pushing something through the water 10 times faster than normal requires 100 times the force, which needs to be applied to some hard point on the back end that probably doesn't exist. The drag on the front presents a similar problem. At some point you'll crush the sub from front to back.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The hull of the sub is rigid, resisting the increasing water pressure as it dives. The interior of the sub doesn't experience a pressure increase. In reverse, a rapid surfacing reduces hull pressure, but the air inside doesn't experience a pressure decrease.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
