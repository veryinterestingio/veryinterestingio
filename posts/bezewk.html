		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a saying in linguistics: &quot;A language is a dialect with a flag and an army.&quot;</p>
<p>The field of Linguistics does not actually define what is a &quot;language.&quot; Linguistics definitely has the concept of a dialect, and can discuss whether two groups of people speak the same dialect or different dialects. It has concepts of things like mutual intelligibility, i.e. can native speakers of two dialects understand each other. But the idea that two dialects are part of the same &quot;language&quot; is a question that linguistics entirely cedes to the field of politics.</p>
<p>So, the answer to your question: China considers itself a single political unit, and they place a high value on considering themselves unified. France, Italy, Spain, and Portugal consider themselves distinct political units from each other, and modern Italy considers itself distinct from the Roman empire. </p>
<p>It's also worth noting that people from different regions in Italy sometimes can't understand each other, because dialects of Italian have a very large spread. Again, they're considered the same language because Italy wants to perceive itself as a single unified cultural entity.</p>
<p>Were one of these regions of Italy to become independent, it's likely they would consider their dialect to a language over time, although that process would likely involve doubling-down on the regionally-distinct features of that dialect, and probably having a distinct literary tradition as well. Something like this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_language_conflict" target="_blank">already happened</a> when Norway became independent of Denmark.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In imperial china, many different spoken languages existed all throughout the country. Mandarin, Hakka, Cantonese, etc. Were all spoken in different regions, similar to spoken languages in Europe were. Most people didn't care about written chinese during those tines because most people couldn't read. The largest portion of people who could read were all government employees who received/sent scrolls to/from other provinces or from the capital. These people only spoke whatever the regional language was, unless they interacted directly with other provinces or the capital (in which case they would learn their regional language, or Mandarin in the case of the capital), however everyone could understand the written form regardless of their spoken language because of a mutual consensus on what each individual character meant. </p>
<p>This would mean that someone could dictate in Mandarin to write on a scroll, then the scroll could be sent anywhere in the empire and could be read by anyone able to read regardless of what their spoken language is. </p>
<p>If you go to china today, you will only see chinese characters everywhere because chinese is the written language. You can read the same passage written in chinese in any spoken (chinese) language, and it will mean the exact same, even if the spoken language is different. It is this unification on writing which defines the chinese written language. The Chinese government has slowly tried to replace all other spoken languages in china with Mandarin over the past few decades, so minority languages like Shanghaiese or Hakka may go extinct in the coming years, but any writings will still exist and will still be understandable because of the character consensus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is political. The different so called Chinese dialects are unintelligible to each other. Others have mentioned the Serbo-Croatian-Bosnian example but something similar happened with Romanian. In Moldova they speak Moldovan and Erie it in the cyrillic alphabet. Why? Because when they became part of the USSR it wad decided they didn't speak Romanian and they had to come up with grammar books for Moldovan using the cyrillic alphabet. </p>
<p>Other times it's not so clear cut. Depending on who you ask galician is a dialect of Portuguese or a separate different language. For context,  a galician and a Brazilian can have a conversation with each speaking their own tongue they just can't speak each other's tongue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the answers which have been already provided, I'd also like to point out that before the 20th Century, spoken language in China wasn't standardized, so all spoken varieties of Chinese were considered dialects. In maps, you see distinctive areas of the map marked off, with &quot;Mandarin-speaking&quot; areas and &quot;Cantonese-speaking&quot; areas with sharp boundaries between them, but in reality it's a gradient of thousands of dialects spread out over a wide geographic area. The people in the &quot;Mandarin-speaking&quot; area weren't all speaking school-taught Putonghua, but local Mandarin dialects, many of which might not be understandable to people who only speak school Mandarin. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The Chinese word for dialect, &quot;fangyan&quot;, literally means &quot;speech of a place&quot;, and dialects are typically identified by the place they come from, ie &quot;Beijing dialect&quot;, &quot;Nanjing dialect&quot;, &quot;Sichuan dialect&quot;, &quot;Shanghai dialect&quot;. When every single place has a slightly different speech, but with readily-apparent similarities, as opposed to a foreign language like English or Mongolian, it's a little bit easier to contextualize why they're so ingrained in the popular imagination as dialects. If you can understand 90% of what your neighbors speak, are they speaking a separate language or a dialect? What about the people a little further off for who you can only understand 70%? What about people across the country, and you can still understand 50%, and still have a somewhat understandable conversation if both sides limited themselves to simpler words? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As an example, my wife from northern Jiangsu speaks a Mandarin dialect that's local only to one district of one city of that province. The differences are similar enough to standard Mandarin that it sounds and is identified as Mandarin, but I still understand only 50-60% of what's spoken (think of a California speaker trying to understand pure, un-diluted rural Scottish) and have to ask her family members to switch to Putonghua (standard Mandarin) when speaking to me. Same when traveling to Yunnan, on the opposite side of China. On maps, they speak what linguists call &quot;Mandarin&quot;, and I hear lots of similarities, but neither of us understand enough and locals have to use standard Mandarin with speaking to us. This situation is reflected even at the very leadership of the country; Xi Jinping and Hu Jintao were the first modern Chinese leaders to speak Mandarin without any accent. Their predecessors, Jiang Zemin, Deng Xiaoping, Mao Zedong, Chiang Kai-shek, Sun Yat-sen, etc, all had extremely heavy provincial dialects, if they even spoke Mandarin at all. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>For my own situation, my family are Cantonese and Cantonese speakers, but &quot;Cantonese&quot; actually refers to only the dialect of the provincial capital (and Hong Kong), though because of its status many people in the province speak it also, and it's also become a language of media and culture. My grandparents come from the rural countryside of the &quot;Cantonese-speaking area&quot;, and while they spoke Cantonese to me, among themselves they spoke their own village dialects, which while linguistically classified as Cantonese, isn't actually understandable by people who only speak standard Cantonese of the capital.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
