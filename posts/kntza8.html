		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The brain generates chemicals as a reaction to many things, separation or loss being one of them. You know that feeling of anxiety you get when you are saying goodbye to people who are moving away or you know you won't see for a while? This is caused by a chemical reaction the brain has when it realizes there will be separation from a person, pet, or object that the person has become emotionally attached to. This chemical is basically maxed out when losing someone through death because it is a permanent goodbye rather than temporary. The chemical released due to loss causes anxiety and stress levels to get so high that it increases the risk of depression and even illness. It's basically the chemical opposite of serotonin.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know the details (not sure anyone does) - there’s a complicated cascade of processes that kindle the waves of grief that wash over us and subside. The disinterest in doing things and inability to concentrate are symptoms of depression. It’s normal and healthy even though it’s unpleasant. I’m sorry you’re going through it. We’ve all been there. One trick that might be helpful: next time you feel a wave of grief welling up, see if you can remember that this feeling means that the one who is gone mattered to you, which is a rare and beautiful thing. Rather than letting the fireworks of that grieving process turn to sorrow, see if you can instead let the energy of the experience kickstart feelings of gratitude for having had that person in your life for whatever time you were together. There are never any guarantees in life. All of this comes to an end for everyone. How lucky to have any time together at all! Any one of us could go at any moment. How lucky to have an opportunity to form a meaningful relationship, to have the experience of loving someone, and to be loved - even for a short time. Not everyone is so lucky. It’s possible to let the grief reveal a sense of deep gratitude and appreciation rather than a deep sense of loss. These are two sides of the same coin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
