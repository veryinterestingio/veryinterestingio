		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially yes. We can already grow cells in labs and have many &quot;cell lines&quot; (cells that all come from one lineage and can essentially be propagated indefinitely, in one way or another). In general, they'll add virus to a susceptible cell line being grown in a dish and let the virus infect + kill the cells. For viruses, these are probably mammalian cells... and given that they would then normally have an immune system they're usually pretty susceptible, and a company will obviously pick a cell line that maximizes production (given some constraints, ie such as try to avoid human cells where possible).</p>
<p>As to how they get the virus itself, either a university or research institution such as a hospital or government lab will give it to them. If not, and if it cannot be purchased commercially, theoretically you can introduce the viral DNA using various existing biotechnology techniques to get it to start replicating. Once it does it's far more trivial, because it's a virus that replicates itself. To be clear, the virus consists of its genetic material and a limited set of proteins encoded by this genetic material that are required to enter the cell and hijack cellular processes to create these same proteins from the genetic material, and to copy the genetic material. These proteins and genetic material will self-assemble before release, and go on to infect other cells and repeat the process exponentially.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the ways you make vaccines is to make the viruses grow in, and therefore adapt to,  other animals. You make flu vaccine by making the virus grow in chicken embryos. So that naturally makes more viruses then you put in and you only need a very small sample of the human virus to get started. For some more modern vaccines like the HPV vaccine the virus's shell is made by GMO yeast from the genetic sequence. So you don't need to get the live virus. One of the newest methods of making vaccines is called an RNA vaccine. In those kinds of vaccines your own cells are taught to make pieces of the virus but not the whole thing. Those cells then show their new proteins to your immune system which learns to attack them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While researching <a href="https://dashamlav.com/viral-diseases/" target="_blank">disease causing viruses</a>, I think they extract the virus from samples provided by the hospitals / testing labs. Once they have gotten a few <a href="https://dashamlav.com/virus-structure-life-cycle/" target="_blank">virus particles</a>, they can be &quot;farmed&quot; as viruses can replicate in suitable environment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The vaccine doesnt always need the 'whole virus'.</p>
<p>Generally the vaccine  will contain only the part of the virus which elicits a response in the host and is generally unique to the virus in question. The host can be humans, or dogs or whatever species you're trying to vaccinate. The point of the vaccine it tricks the body in to thinking it has been infected and to generate the antibodies, so that when it does get infected, it has the tools needed to fight the actual real infection.</p>
<p>When a virus enters the body, it is attacked by antibodies, which are present **only if that virus (or other pathogen) has been in the body before (also known as adaptive immunity)**.  If the host has not been exposed to that infecting agent before, then the body has to respond with its natural (innate) immune responses and also to start to make the antibodies, which takes time and gives the virus a head start in the infection process.</p>
<p>Lets take COVID-19. There are companies who make the code (mRNA) for the spike protein on the virus - this is the part of the COVID-19 virus which has been found to be unique to that virus and elicits the infection in humans and is the best target for antibodies.</p>
<p>This spike protein mRNA is generated in cells (usually, mammalian, bacterial, yeast or insect) by adding DNA to those cells, which subsequently make the desired mRNA. the mRNA is extracted, purified and tested. </p>
<p>Today, there are phase II clinical trials started where this mRNA vaccine is given to test subjects to see if they generate the antibodies against the spike protein. </p>
<p>After that the vaccine goes to Phase III and if successful, it is produces <em>en masse</em> for human use</p>
<p>Other ways to make vaccines is to make an actual protein from the infecting viral agent, though this generally can take &gt;10 years. mRNA vaccines are much easier and quicker to make and are gaining a lot of traction in recent times. There are many mRNA vaccines on the market currently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They transfect cells and extract the viruses via viral isolation technique similar to DNA isolation but much more complex.You can find the whole technique in Doranâ€™s book.This could all be performed in petri dish.One has to be careful though, wince chances of contamination are much higher in viral extraction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
