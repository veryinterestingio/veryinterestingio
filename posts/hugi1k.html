		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They remain separate genetically, but from your examples for most blood donations it’s a bit different. If you’re talking about transfusions of packed red blood cells, those lack a nucleus in the first place so there’s no genetic content in them, and their lifespan is pretty short anyway. For bone marrow transplants (for example in leukaekia treatment), what happens there is that haematopoietic stem cells (stem cells in the bone marrow that give rise to mature blood cells) are killed off by radiation, and the donor’s ones are transferred in. After that, the person becomes a chimera - his blood cells are genetically from the donor (if 100% depletion), while peripherally his tissues have his own DNA. If any of his original haematopoietic cells survive the radiation (e.g. if it’s only a local depletion of the cancer, although I don’t know if it’s actually done in practice - if that’s the case your own healthy haematopoietic stem cells should be able to repopulate the niche), then his blood will have a portion of his cells with his own DNA, and a portion of cells that have the donor’s DNA. This will be reflected by DNA tests, and in fact commercial testing companies such as 23AndMe don’t recommend using their service for ancestry tracing if you’ve received a bone marrow transplant for that reason, because it could muddy up results and analysis if you try and track who you’re descended from.</p>
<p>That being said, for transplants, you need to match them in certain genes in order to reduce the risk of rejection, even with the use of immunosuppressive drugs after transplant. These are typically the genes of the major histocompatibility complex that play the biggest role in determining rejection, but there are other minor histocompatibility antigens and a whole range of other genetic loci to be considered. Different organs also have different tendencies to be rejected, for example liver transplants can tolerate some degree of mismatch, while kidneys tend to need to be well-matched, and even with decent matching there may be immune rejection of the foreign organ years after the transplant has occurred.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As I understand, they must remain different due to the way cells replicate themselves. Cells replicate by mitosis, where the DNA is replicated and then split into two identical cells. So DNA is not mixed in growth/repair of said organ. I think the reason the new DNA is not rejected is because they have the same ‘markers’ as your own cells in your body. This means your body does not see them as foreign and attack them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
