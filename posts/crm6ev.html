		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Finally a question I can answer! Engineer here. Basically, most hotels use industrial  size water heaters, at least one large storage tank, and a return pipe. So you have 3 domestic water pipes instead of 2. Cold, hot, and hot return. Pumps constantly circulate the hot water, it is either going to get used, or go back to the tank. The tank is then sized for peak water flow, which would be early morning showers when the hotel is fully booked. So you can have a few hundred gallons of instant hot water available, then during non peak times, the water in the tank is heated. </p>
<p>The same types of systems are also used in office buildings, albeit a much smaller scale. A mid or even a high rise office building rarely has showers, and usually only have one or 2 sets of restrooms per floor. Sinks in public bathrooms usually don’t use a lot of hot water.</p>
<p>Edit: thanks for the silver!</p>
<p>Edit 2: thanks for the gold!</p>
<p>Edit 3: a lot of people have been asking if the hot water return is recycled water that has gone down the drain. No, it isn’t, that would be nasty. Return water simply means water that has not been used. If the water does not get used by a faucet, it gets returned to the tank. Once it comes out of a faucet, it’s not going back in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They use recirculating hot water.  You can even get this in your house, for the cost of a special pump.  The hot water pipes form a loop, and the pump slowly circulates the water through the loop.  This means the water gets hot almost instantly, which saves water.  A boiler adds heat at the rate that cold water flows into the system, sometimes with a separate water heater stage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Shorter answer. Hot water is continuously recirculated to the hot water tank for reheating rather than being  left to cool off in the pipes. Nicer homes have these recirculation pumps now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It also depends on the country. In my country there are a lot of apartment blocks. So, hot water and heating (also done with hot water) are not produced by the building - instead it is produced by special facilities that each deliver it through underground pipes to a certain area of the city. In winter, in order for the water to be hot when it reaches the building, it needs to leave the facility at super high temperatures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty simple. Bigger buildings = more pipes and bigger heaters.</p>
<p>Many places (mainly in Eastern Europe) provide hot water to entire cities, not only big buildings. Heat that would normally be lost during normal power plant operation is used to heat water to \~40 degrees C. Contrary to what you might think, it's pretty efficient as large pipes don't suffer much from heat loss.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
