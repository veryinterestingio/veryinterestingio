	<title>ELI5: Why don’t electric cars (like Teslas) all have solar panels built in to the roof that could add to the battery’s charge all day? Is it just cost prohibitive for the panels themselves? Would the surface area of such small panels not contribute enough power throughout the day to justify them?</title>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was on a R &amp; D design team for Fisker 10 years ago. We researched all sorts of ideas on how to generate power from solar power collecting paint, regenerative breaking, turning heat into electricity....(I actually wrote a book on it!)....it actually takes a lot to make and store power. So the best thing we found was how to be more efficient (aerodynamics, better tires, better bearings, smarter motors, new battery technology....)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Add to it the cost of replacement/repair, and adding hundreds of dollars to the cost in order to maybe someday getting a return on that investment doesn't make sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
