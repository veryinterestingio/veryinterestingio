		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most important component of electrical transmission, or the process of delivering electricity over long distances, is the <a href="https://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=18258" target="_blank">high voltage</a> used. Voltage describes how much electricity wants to move from one point to another. This is very similar to water going into a tank: if the water has a lot of pressure, more will go into the tank. Current is the speed of the water. </p>
<p>Now, if the pipe going into the tank were partially blocked so that water could only flow in at a specific rate, the pipe would have some resistance. These three electrical quantities are related by <a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/direct-current/chpt-2/voltage-current-resistance-relate/" target="_blank">Ohm’s law</a>, which states that voltage is the product of current and resistance. For instance, if we were to block off more of the pipe in the water tank while increasing the speed of the water, pressure would build up. Similarly, increasing either resistance or current increases voltage. Going the other way, if resistance is kept constant by using one type of wire, increasing voltage decreases current. You can see a demonstration of this concept in this <a href="https://youtu.be/_eBnz44Nhmw" target="_blank">video</a>.</p>
<p>Power companies use this effect to their advantage for transmission lines and increase the voltage significantly. This voltage “pressure” allows electricity to travel long distances without losing too much energy on the way. Why exactly do higher voltages have to be used? As news site <a href="http://insideenergy.org/2015/11/06/lost-in-transmission-how-much-electricity-disappears-between-a-power-plant-and-your-plug/" target="_blank">Inside Energy</a> explains, it’s important to keep current low in transmission lines to minimize power losses. Like the pipes leading to a water tank, transmission lines aren’t perfect and lose some of the electricity they carry. </p>
<p>If water is flowing very quickly through a pipe, any leaks will intensify. Similarly, a higher current will cause a transmission line to lose more power. This power loss is a big problem for cables that can stretch hundreds or even thousands of miles. Further, it has a secondary negative effect that can damage the lines: <a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/what-is-joule-heating-producing-heat-with-electric-current/" target="_blank">wasted power is converted to heat</a>, which degrades the power lines over time. </p>
<p>Power companies perform this step-up of voltage using transformers. These are coils of wire that <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/blog/what-is-a-transformer-and-how-does-it-work" target="_blank">increase voltage while decreasing current</a> by the same factor. Even though wall outlets output 120 volts in the U.S. for safety, transmission lines can carry up to <a href="https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Electrical_transmission#cite_note-sec-3" target="_blank">800,000 volts</a>. These high voltages are passed through more transformers closer to residential areas for delivery. </p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: They carry high voltages, which reduce power losses and allow transmission over long distances.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The water analogy of electricity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Voltage = Electric pressure</li>
<li>Current = water flow (current)</li>
<li>Resistance = resistance to flow</li>
</ul>
<p>High Voltage but low current (similar to a pressure washer) can be dangerous because it easily &quot;pushes&quot; a lot of electricity where it isn't supposed to go. Large current (amperage) but low voltage (similar to a flood) can be dangerous because an enormous volume of flow can &quot;drown&quot; something it goes into that it's not supposed to. High voltage high current is like a steam pipe and will just vaporize you. Similarly, for a given voltage increasing the resistance will <em>decrease</em> the current; for a given current, increasing the resistance will <em>increase</em> the voltage pressure. Think of it in terms of water flowing through a pipe with a restriction and it should make intuitive sense. </p>
<p>Power is measured in units of Energy per Time - something higher powered can do the same work in less time, like a race car vs a bicycle traveling some long distance. For electrical flow, power is voltage (V) times current (I), the pushing of a current by electrical pressure. Energy can't be created or destroyed just converted between different types, so for a given amount of power (P) the voltage times current (V*I) will be constant. </p>
<p>We also know from our analogy earlier that V = I*R (ohms law) so we can substitute that in and get two versions of the equation for power:</p>
<ul>
<li>P = (V^2 )/R</li>
<li>P = (I^2 )*R</li>
</ul>
<p>This is in an ideal world - in reality, any current will have losses from electrons bouncing against atoms as they flow, the &quot;friction&quot; caused by resistance to it flowing, and high current has HUGE losses because of that. Luckily, Voltage doesn't have near the losses because it's just transmitting &quot;pressure&quot; with a relatively small flow. So we use high voltage power lines to transmit energy far distances, then use transformers to step them down to lower voltages (240V or 120V) for use. The power remains essentially constant, but we transform between voltage and current depending on which is most useful at that location. </p>
<p>Be aware that this is a conceptual approximation, and the water analogy will get you into trouble if you don't remember that it's an analogy. &quot;All models are wrong; some models are useful.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The more amps you have running through a wire, the more loss there will be.  So they use thick wire, as low as possible amperage, and as high as possible voltage.  If voltage * amp = X, then you can still get X by having 2(voltage) * 0.5(amp) = X.  Since the second one has lower amps it will have lower losses.  X being wattage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
