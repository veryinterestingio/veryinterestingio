		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The true answer is that science does not yet know for sure the exact answer to this question, but it seems to be that they formed inside proto-galaxies in the first billion years of the universe. </p>
<p>We still aren't sure how supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early universe grew to be so big so fast, but the general consensus at this point is they initially grew rapidly through countless mergers of stellar (approx 3-100 solar masses) and intermediate (100-10,000 solar masses) mass black holes, then continued to grow by accreting gas and dust, forming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar" target="_blank">quasars</a> in the process. </p>
<p>Stellar mass black holes are formed from massive stars at the end of their short lives of just a few million years, typically with a supernova explosion, and <a href="http://www.astro.yale.edu/larson/papers/SciAm04.pdf" target="_blank">it is predicted</a> that during the early universe there were enormous numbers of these stars forming and dying. Intermediate mass black holes can either be formed by mergers between smaller black holes, or potentially via <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06649" target="_blank">direct collapse of gas clouds</a>.</p>
<p>Over millions of years repeated gravitational interactions between objects in a galaxy will cause more massive objects to tend to collect at the center while less massive objects are kicked out further. Gas clouds provide further braking forces which drive these black holes towards the galactic core until they eventually collide and merge. Galactic collisions drive more gas inwards towards the forming SMBH, forming an accretion disc which becomes a quasar, gradually adding mass to the black hole over millions of years. Computer simulations suggest that these processes are too slow to explain the speed at which the largest black holes grew in the early universe so it is likely that this is not the complete picture.</p>
<p>One potential answer is that direct gas cloud collapse <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/370/1/289/1026607" target="_blank">can directly produce a SMBH</a> far larger than previously thought. Another theory is that quantum fluctuations in the moment after the Big Bang <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3848" target="_blank">produced large numbers of massive black holes</a> spread throughout the early universe. These would have rapidly collected in the cores of protogalaxies and merged, however their gravity would still be insignificant in comparison to the Hydrogen gas and dark matter making up the majority of the mass of these galaxies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They were formed during the beginning of the universe. We can know this by calculating their current growth (the current growth is very minimal). </p>
<p>The first stars were formed within about 200 million years, some of them with a lifespan of only 100 million years, would then become black holes. During this early stage, millions of stars were born every single second, and the same goes for deaths. (Compare this to about 4800 stars/second today). These black holes would relatively quickly collide (50-100 million years), and form supermassive black holes, creating the first galaxies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If part of your question is whether SMBHs are integral to the structure of galaxies, the answer is most likely not. What keeps galaxies together is the dark matter in them (it's believed they're essentially large halos of dark matter with some regular matter in them). The gravity of our central black hole is huge and its mass is 4.6 million times that of the sun, but keep in mind the mass of the visible matter of the milky way is estimated to be somewhere in between 200 to 600 <strong>billion</strong> times that of the sun, so the central black hole is teensy tiny compared to the galaxy as a whole</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It is a more recent simulation of galactic supercluster formation, and while it doesnâ€™t directly involve supermassive black hole formation, I thought it might prove interesting for some, gravitationally speaking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
