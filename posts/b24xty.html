		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both! </p>
<p>When the stomach is physically full, stretch receptors in the wall are activated, sending signals along parasympathetic (rest and digest) nerves to suppress the hunger centres in the brain. </p>
<p>In addition, the composition of the food - its carbohydrate, protein and fat make up - will play an important role. Glucose levels are closely linked to hunger, as it is the main fuel used by most cells in the body. When glucose is high, insulin is released and glucose is driven into the cells; when it is low hormones like glucagon are released to drive glucose out of its stores in the liver. </p>
<p>A hormone called cholecystokinin (CCK) is also released in response to amino acid and fat presence in the duodenum (first part of small intestine) and this delays the emptying of the stomach, resulting in you feeling fuller for longer. CCK also has effects on the central nervous system to reduce the feeling of hunger. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's a lot more than 1 or 2 factors going into 'feeling full'. Ghrelin is an interesting hormone that plays a role in the feeling of hunger - mostly stimulated by protein and carbohydrate. But fat, on the other hand, slows gastric emptying giving a real physical sense of satiety. </p>
<p>There is a difference between the physical sensation of being full, and being satiated, or not hungry. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s important to distinguish between “feeling full” and “not feeling hungry.” Feeling full is usually the result of eating too much physical food. Not feeling hungry is your body signaling that it has enough nutrients in the bloodstream to provide adequate energy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You can eat until full and not feel satisfied, you can eat until satisfied and not feel full, and you can eat until you are full and satisfied.</p>
<p>So it's a difficult answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I heard it was pressure on the vagus nerve. The smaller the stomach the quicker the feeling of fullness, which is one reason losing weight is so hard, because a bigger stomach needs more food before the nerve is engaged. To lose weight you have to undereat and forego that pleasure of fullness till the stomach shrinks back to proper size.
Eating more than a few bites after the nerve is pleasured will eventually cause obesity.
There's a lot of new research on the vagus as it has not been well understood till recently. </p>
<p>(Actually I haven't the vagus idea, but I play a nutritionist on the Internet ;) )</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
