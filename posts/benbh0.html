		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Onions are made up of mostly colourless fluid. They appear white because of all The connective tissue in the onion. When you cook the onion the bonds holding the connective tissue break and they become more transparent.
It's similar to why polar bears look white.</p>
<p>Edit: I was wrong. Onions have air pockets which causes the light to refract. But the polar bear fact is still true.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When  the onion turns translucent, the cell walls are breaking down. But more  important to the difference in flavor between raw and cooked onions are  sulfur compounds floating in the cell fluid and sulfur-reacting enzymes  stored in vacuoles (basically closed storage compartments) inside the  cells.</p>
<p>When you cut or chew on a bit of  raw onion, these vacuoles are ruptured, and the enzymes inside react  with the sulfur in the cell fluid, creating strong, irritating compounds  (intended, of course, to discourage animals from eating the plant). In  particular, onions, shallots, and some related plants, when sliced,  produce a compound called 'lacrimator', which is both light and  volatile. It enters the air and first acts on the nerve endings in your  eyes, causing some direct pain, and then breaks down into tiny amounts  of sulfuric acid, both of which cause you to tear up in defense.</p>
<p>The  process of cooking onions denatures these enzymes, stopping the process  of converting the intracellular sulfur compounds into these defensive  compounds, which removes the harsh flavors, leaving just the sweet, sort  of meaty flavor that we all know and love.</p>
<p>Sweet  or Vidalia onions, which are grown in particularly low-sulfur soil,  don't have many of the sulfur precursors in their cells, which is why  they're so much less harsh when used raw.</p>
<p>You can read all about the process in Harold McGee's On Food and Cooking.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ol>
<li>Onions cells (called vacuoles) are full of a concentrated solution of salts, nutrients, etc. This gives them a different refractive index (light bending power) from the cytoplasm that fills the space between the cells.</li>
<li>When small drops of a liquid (= onion cells) are dispersed in a liquid of a different refractive index (= cytoplasm), the mixture looks white (e.g. oil and water whisked to become vinaigrette).</li>
<li>When cooked, the onion cells burst and the two liquids mix, so their compositions become equal and the difference in refractive index that caused the whiteness disappears - the onion becomes transparent.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The water in the onion's cells boils and breaks the cell walls. The cell structure breakdown reduces its opacity &amp; rigidity. They then turn brown as the sugar in the cells caramelizes and becomes super tasty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
