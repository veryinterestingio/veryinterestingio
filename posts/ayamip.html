		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, it's a bad idea to eat the same species simply based on a disease transmission perspective. (I'm sure there are plenty of psychological issues involved as well.)</p>
<p>But a major concern in animal production is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmissible_spongiform_encephalopathy" target="_blank">transmissible spongiform encephalitis (TSE)</a> or the more popular: mad cow disease. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prion" target="_blank">Prions</a>, an infectious protein, can basically turn a brain into Swiss cheese. These mutated proteins occur naturally, albeit rarely, but can &quot;infect&quot; another of the same and sometimes other species if they are eaten. So in the case of mad cow, the cows were being fed a protein mix that included brain and spinal cord tissue from other cattle.</p>
<p>We see the same thing in people with [kuru](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuru_(disease" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuru_(disease</a>).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kuru was transmitted among members of the Fore tribe of Papua New Guinea via <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannibalism" target="_blank">funerary cannibalism</a>. Deceased family members were traditionally cooked and eaten, which was thought to help free the spirit of the dead. Women and children usually consumed the brain, the organ in which infectious prions were most concentrated, thus allowing for transmission of kuru. The disease was therefore more prevalent among women and children.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It makes sense that pathogens have evolved to thrive in certain environments, so human pathogens would be easier to contract than animal pathogens. Any pathogen that wasn't eradicated during cooking would find a perfect new host to infect.</p>
<p>Then there's Prions, which aren't exactly a pathogen. As already mentioned in here, Prions are a mutated protein that can contact and mutate healthy proteins and turn the brain into Swiss Cheese, like Mad Cow disease. Since they're proteins they can't be killed with heat during cooking. Brains that have been sitting in formaldehyde for decades can still pass on spongiform disease. It's relatively rare at 1.5 per million, but a cannibalistic community would be at a much higher risk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The long-and-short of it is that if you eat a diseased human, you may be at risk of contracting the same disease. Prions are one of the 'scariest' things, as they cannot be effectively killed by cooking, are usually present long before symptoms arise, and often fatal. However, most protonic diseases are very rare in most parts of the world. But if the person is healthy, you're physiology good to go. Morally, questionable, and definitely illegal, but definitely safe to eat properly cooked healthy human meat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
