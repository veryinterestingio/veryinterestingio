		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 3 types of honeybees in a given colony:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>More than 85% of all the bees are female workers. They do all the important tasks that keep the hive running smoothly, but cannot reproduce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The remaining ~15% of bees are drones, the male bees. They can't do anything (even feed themselves) except try and mate with a virgin queen from another hive. If they succeed they immediately die, and if they don't the workers will forcibly evict or kill them before winter.</p>
</li>
<li>Every hive has one queen. Her only job is to lay eggs, but her pheromones also help keep the hive in a healthy state. She mates once at the beginnning of her life and then can lay &gt;1000 eggs a day during the summer for 1-5 years.</li>
</ol>
<p>Bees have an interesting sex-determination system. All fertilized eggs that the queen lays become female, and unfertilized eggs become male drones. This means the drones have half as many chromosomes as their sisters, and actually don't have a father. </p>
<p>The fertilized female eggs are all fed a substance secreted by the workers called &quot;royal jelly&quot; for the first 2 days of their lives, but then most of them are switched to a diet of honey and pollen. This change in diet causes hormonal changes that prevent the bees from becoming sexually mature and this causes them turn into workers.</p>
<p>When the workers want/need to raise a new queen, they pick an egg and build a special &quot;queen cell&quot; around it, that's kind of peanut-shaped and hangs down instead of the normal hexagonal honeycomb. These queens-to-be are fed only royal jelly for their entire lives, even as adults. They fully mature and develop active ovaries. </p>
<p>Fun fact: bees usually raise multiple replacement queens at the same time, to hedge their bets that one successfully mates. However, if one emerges first she'll kill the others before they can reach adulthood. There's so much selective pressure to be the first that queens mature around 25% faster than normal workers. If multiple virgin queens emerge simultaneously they'll fight to the death until only one remains. This is pretty much the only time a queen will use her stinger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically, any female larva can potentially become a queen.  In contrast to some other social species (e.g., some ants), caste determination in honey bees is pretty much purely determined by environment rather than genetics.  Specifically, the fate of a female larva depends on the diet she is fed by other bees.  It's been known for some time that <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/AllJH.svg" target="_blank">juvenile hormones</a> can be applied to larvae topically in order to induce queen development (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1972.tb00239.x" target="_blank">Wirtz and Beetsma 1972</a>), though other factors are also involved (such as the aptly named protein royalactin; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10093" target="_blank">Kamakura 2011</a>).  </p>
<p>Plenty of more recent research has gone into looking at how these environmental differences actually effect downstream changes related to queen development.  As you might expect, most of the differences have to do with changes in expression of a wide variety of genes (<a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2000-2-1-research0001" target="_blank">Evans and Wheeler 2000</a>), some of which are interestingly mediated by relatively newly discovered mechanisms like <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/MiRNA.svg" target="_blank">microRNAs</a> (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep18794" target="_blank">Ashby et al. 2016</a>).</p>
<p>Also as a very minor correction, nurse bees aren't a separate caste from workers.  All workers proceed through several stages of different &quot;jobs&quot; as they age.  The general progression is something like <a href="https://www.afir-beekeeping-center.com/uploads/2/5/9/8/25986192/bee-jobs_2.jpg" target="_blank">cleaning -&gt; nursing -&gt; building -&gt; guarding -&gt; foraging -&gt; death</a>.  Interestingly, this again differs from some other social insects which <em>do</em> have permanent roles, again like some ants (leafcutters are a particularly good example with <a href="https://askabiologist.asu.edu/sites/default/files/resources/articles/ant_colony/Caste%20sizes.jpg" target="_blank">many different sizes of workers/soldiers</a>).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Does this mean that there is no meaningful 'leader' of a bee colony beyond the literal hivemind, as the queen has no authority and even what eggs she lays and when she lives or dies is decided by some unknown global factor among the population at large?
