		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a transplant coordinator and have worked in the field of organ donation since 2009.  </p>
<p>I work for three transplant centers currently.  All have done record number of transplants this  year.  One center completely transplanted all of the people on its lung list twice.  A heart program transplanted everyone on its heart list except the sensitized patients and I've lost track of how many renal transplants the other center has done.</p>
<p>To put things in terms of numbers in September of 2019 I received an average of 10 organ offers a day when I worked.  In September of 2020 I received an average of 21 organ offers a day.  </p>
<p>I would do a thoracic transplant (heart or lungs) once in every three to five shifts in 2019.  Since June of 2020 I do a thoracic transplant probably about 3 out of every 4 shifts.  </p>
<p>Renal transplants happened about once in every three shifts before, we do a renal transplant almost every day now, sometimes we do two. </p>
<p>I've spoken to friends that work at 2 OPOs.  One I used to work for and they did about 200 donors a year and their goal for this year was 208.  By the first week in October they had already done 240 and were on track to do 300. </p>
<p>The other's goal was 190 and they did 294 donors this year.</p>
<p>We had a very big dip in donation in March.  For a couple of weeks there were almost no transplants that happened.  Things were slow in April too but got back to normal in May and then exploded in June and just kept going.  We had another two &quot;slow&quot; weeks around the end of October beginning of November when things were only a little increased over previous years, but other than that it has been non-stop.</p>
<p>I work about 280-310 hours a month now.  Last week I worked 96 hours. </p>
<p>I actually looked at the total number of offers for the whole of 2020, including the normal first couple of months and the severe drop for about a month and a half going to the end of September and we had an increase of 7% in the number of organ offers over 2019.  I'd imagine that increase was greater by the end of the year but I haven't had the time to actually do the math yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would like to say up front, that Organ Donation is definitely not how you see it on tv. I know thatâ€™s obvious for a lot of things. But people seem to have a huge misunderstanding of how the donation process works.</p>
<p>The huge majority of patients that have donated their organs are people that have been admitted to the hospital, their bodies are being ventilated with a machine and they have been tested and declared brain dead. These patients have died from a number of reasons. Trauma, stroke, medical conditions, drug overdoses, etc.</p>
<p>Before a Donor can be deemed suitable for recovery of organs. A barrage of testing has to be completed. One of those tests is now for Covid. If the patient is Covid Positive, it is an immediate rule out for donation (Edit: This can vary by Organ Procurement Organization (OPO))
So yes, Covid is having an effect on the amount of transplants.</p>
<p>Edit: Here is more information about the Deceased Donor donation process from <a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/about/process/deceased-donation.html" target="_blank">Organdonor.gov</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Living donations have declined significantly (primarily kidney transplants). Deceased donor organs carry a risk of transmitting COVID to the recipient, if they're even suitable for transplant, so they're excluded.</p>
<p>People with COVID add to the waiting list for lung transplants. That is a tough wait list to survive.</p>
