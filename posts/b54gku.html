		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>ELI10</strong>: </p>
<p>Way back in the day people in England used to measure the amount of alcohol in something by soaking gunpowder with it and seeing if it burned.  The lowest amount of alcohol content needed for it to burn was called 100 proof and was about 57% alcohol by volume.</p>
<p>Add a few centuries, lots of math and a bunch of rounding errors and eventually you end up with the U.S. deciding enough of this proof thing lets use ABV, and I guess for a simple ratio we'll say that 50% ABV = 100 proof.</p>
<p><strong>ELI5</strong>:</p>
<p>If you put half water and half alcohol on gunpowder it will burn, and that's the &quot;proof&quot; that its really strong alchohol. </p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>:</p>
<p>I primarily set out to answer &quot;Why is proof on alchoholic beverages twice the percentage of alcoholic content?&quot;.  I didn't really answer &quot;Why not simply just label the percentage?&quot;.  The answer to that is as follows:</p>
<p>AFAIK Every country in the world now labels their alcohol by ABV.  This includes the U.S.. Some companies <strong>also</strong> label the proof - most likely for marketing reasons.   &quot;120 Proof&quot; sounds stronger than &quot;60% ABV&quot; even though its the same thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In olden days, the potency of alcohol was measured by pouring a little of the alcohol over gunpowder and lighting it on fire. If it burned with a steady blue flame, it was the alcohol was proof spirit. Proof spirit was taxed higher in ye olde England. This proofing method had a problem: the flammability of the liquor was dependent on its temperature. Since the temperature wasn’t kept consistent, this method for determining a proof spirit wasn’t accurate. Current alcohol proofing is a remnant of those old ways.</p>
<p>However, almost all countries in the world label ABV and not proof. Some use both. But nowhere is alcohol labeled by just its proof.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR: Because that's the way it was defined.</p>
<p>Back in the 16th century a relatively simple way to proof that a product had at least a certain amount of alcohol in it was mixing a bit of it with a bit of gunpowder and then lighting it on fire. If it burned it had at least 57.15% alcohol by volume. That was considered 100 proof (back then).</p>
<p>That was important since if you for example sent a ship to the Carribbean you wouldn't want to go through all that expense to transport rum that was watered down.</p>
<p>Eventually more accurate measurements were developed and specifying alcohol content by percentage of volume (ABV) became the norm.</p>
<p>Still, people liked the sound of &quot;100 proof rum&quot; and such so that stuck around mostly for advertising. But converting between the original proof measurement and the new ABV wasn't convenient. So it was decided to just redefine proof as twice the ABV (it also probably didn't hurt that &quot;new proof&quot; was slightly weaker and thus cheaper to make than &quot;old proof&quot;).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
