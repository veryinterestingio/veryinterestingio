		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One important reason is that mammalian embryos grow inside of a mother. This protects the embryo from environmental factors that could affect its development/influence mutation. It also means that when there are issues with an egg/embryo the mother's body can respond and remove it. Because reptiles lay their eggs and leave, whatever gets laid gets laid, and whatever happens to those eggs happens.</p>
<p>Another reason is that while mammals tend to have just a few babies at a time, many reptile species can lay dozens or even hundreds of eggs at a time. Statistically speaking, there are just more chances for a two headed animal in a clutch of 100 snakes than in a pregnancy of 1 deer. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like many of these answers are about why reptiles are more likely to <em>have</em> this mutation (polycephaly), but not why reptiles and amphibians are (<em>slightly</em>) more likely to live to adulthood when they have it, which is how I interpreted your question.</p>
<p>I'm sure a deep answer would involve more biochemistry than I actually know, but I got this impression from what biology I have:</p>
<p>On a very high level overview, reptiles have gone for a different set of evolutionary trade-offs than mammals. Their bodies are a less tightly regulated (homeostatic) than ours; like, consider that they're cold-blooded and we aren't. Something going wrong with a mammal's internal regulation is just much more likely to cause a cascade of failures, leading to death. It might not even be having two heads specifically that means a 2-headed calf almost never survives more than a few days, but rather, whatever error caused their embryo to develop that way in the first place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Among some of these other good responses, mammals generally have to make a trip through a birth canal sized for the baby's head. Two heads means that both mother and baby are likely to die and never be observed by humans. This isn't an issue hatching out of an egg.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>“ It is also possible for two separated embryos to incompletely fuse to form a two-headed animal.</p>
<p>Two-headedness results from factors that cause malformation of a developing embryo, which can be both genetic or environmental. But it does not tend to be inherited, since two-headed animals do not usually live long or reproduce.</p>
<p>In mammals, &quot;fact-checking&quot; by the mother's body also tends to prevent the implantation of embryos that carry errors like this, Dr Adams said.”</p>
