		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mutations occur at random, usually during viral replication. Because of this, they are not predictable (but might be pseudo-predictable, more on this later), as they could occur in any part of the viral genome. In general, most mutations are harmful to the virus, but on occasion, one will be helpful ( i.e. cause it to replicate more quickly, or give it an advantage to make it more infectious, etc). These tend to become new variant strains. A mutation could also occur that gives it no actual advantage bit doesn't inactivate it either, and this type can also make a new variant.</p>
<p>Many viruses belong to families of genetically similar viruses, which means that large parts of their genomes are similar or even identical. By looking at ways that other viruses from the SARS family mutated, they may be able to make educated guesses about what could be possible for Sars-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. However, those same mutations might never occur in this virus, or that when they occur some other viral gene causes the effects to be different than predicted. </p>
<p>So... It's possible to make an educated attempt at this, but since it is unlikely that a known mutation would cause the exact same effect in an already-mutated strain is low, and no prediction can be made about which gene will mutate at any given time, this isnt likely to be of as much use as being vigilant about identifying new mutations, and then dealing with them as they arise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rather than trying to predict what mutations will arise, scientist target &quot;conserved regions&quot; of a genome. These are regions that rarely mutate, and it's usually because mutations in these regions are not beneficial, or even are bad for survival. These genes that rarely/never mutate are called conserved, and ones that cannot change without weakening the virus/organism is called &quot;essential&quot;. Humans have essential genes as well, they are typically genes that, if mutated, result in pregnancy termination. </p>
<p>The way scientists can tell this is by looking at related viruses, and identify regions that are identical across all strains, families, etc. For example, a non-conserved region may have the amino acid sequence SIINFEKL in virus A, but virus B will have SAENYELL. The S, N, E, and L are conserved since both viruses have them. In a conserved sequence, both viruses with have SIINFEKL, or something similar such as SILNFEKL.</p>
<p>This is why RNA viruses, such as Covid and HIV, can be difficult to vaccinate against, because RNA viruses often mutate much more than a DNA virus such as Epstein Barr Virus or HPV</p>
<p>The problem with this is that these conserved regions are not always optimal vaccination targets. Since most vaccines want to stimulate antibodies, they want to target proteins/sequences on the <em>surface</em> of the virus. On top of that, the antibody needs to actually interfere with the infection pathway; for example, antibody binding the spike protein in Covid reduces its ability to enter cells.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, actually the ideal vaccine target is something that is so essential for the virus that a mutation in that region will be highly unlikely to form a viable virion. In that if it did it would prevent the virus, replicating or entering cells etc.</p>
<p>If a vaccine targets one of these highly conserved regions then if is less likely that resistance will develop. However, it is by no means certain as we have found with  various different viruses over the years.</p>
<p>In terms of predicting mutations it is possible to make educated guesses, or assess new variants and their mutations before they become dominant strains. Eg how the &quot;UK Kent&quot; variant and now the &quot;Indian/Delta Variant&quot; are becoming dominant strains.</p>
<p>Influenza vaccines are essentially made in this way, the northern hemisphere vaccine is based on what southern hemisphere strains were dominant in the preceding flu season. However, this is far from perfect and some years the flu vaccine is not nearly as effective as we would like.</p>
<p>Overall we are somewhat limited by how long it takes to identify/predict significant mutations to vaccine targets and then the logistics of changing a vaccine and mass producing it and delivering it into the arms of the population.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually perform similar research as part of my career. One thing I want to add are techniques such as deep mutational scanning or saturation mutagenesis. Basically, the purpose of this experiment is to introduce every possible mutation across a pre-specified &quot;chunk&quot; of the genome and see how those mutations affect things. For CoV-2 for example, a group at UW has pioneered DMS for CoV-2. In <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6531/850" target="_blank">this paper</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420310035" target="_blank">this paper</a>, they use this approach to understand antibody escape mechanisms (and epitope targeting) as well as some basic virology about CoV-2. Data like the former can be used to predict virus escape and indeed they were able to identify many of the mutations that define the variants of concern.</p>
<p>Happy to answer any follow-up questions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
