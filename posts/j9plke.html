<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>To answer your question, over watering in soil kills the plant because it drowns the roots. Literally. They need oxygen, and soil roots can't get it from water. So, the drowned root system dies and rots and the plant suffers and often dies because of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plants are built different. </p>
<p>The bottom parts, called roots, are built different for some plants. If you zoom in very closely, you can see that they're built differently like pieces of lego, made up of stuff called cells. On the surface of the roots are cells shaped like doors. Some doors are strong enough to block water from getting in. Other doors aren't as strong and let water get in when there's too much. </p>
<p>Roots are like tubes, things enter them from the little doors. The plant needs a correct mix of things entering the roots to be healthy. If the doors don't do their jobs of letting the correct mix of things in, then the plants can't be healthy. </p>
<p>If you put a plant in soil and over-water it, then you're essentially causing problems with its root system. The roots have an easier time controlling what goes in and out when it's just under water because it only has to &quot;filter&quot; water. When it's buried in soil, it has a tough time when there's too much water mixed with everything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I recently got into hydroponics and wondered the same thing. When you grow hydroponicaly, you don't cover the entire root system with water. If so, you get the same result as overwatering in soil. The plant does require oxygen. Hydroponics systems can differ, but you leave an airgap for the small air roots to get oxygen, as the longer roots grow down into the water, you can also use spray jets and spray the water into the roots, allowing air to them, or you can drip water in on off cycles allowing for air to get to the roots. It's pretty fascinating, and a hobby that scratches a lot of nerd itches. Tinkering, biology, chemistry, fluid dynamics, etc. And I get an instant salad from the basement year round. A highly recommended hobby. I recently grew 16 lettuce heads from seed to harvest in about 35 days or so and they were massive. And you can start with a bucket and an inexpensive grow bulb to get started.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
