		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of factors that can affect this, but the most likely suspect would probably be either increased blood flow or an extreme change in heart rate.</p>
<p>Increased blood flow usually happens in your body from infection or wounds since your body wants to get more nutrients and white blood cells there to fight pathogens. Increased blood vessel permeability results in increased interstitial fluid in the affected area. This process causes the swelling/heat/redness, which can 'pulse' because this new mass may place pressure on surrounding large arteries. </p>
<p>Heart rate changes occur from stresses. This is usually from stuff like vigorous exercise or getting scared, with a dramatically increased heart rate of 150+, which is definitely more audible.</p>
<p>Lastly, but not often, if you are relaxed enough and it is quiet enough, it is perfectly possible to hear your heart beating and feel your blood flowing through your body. There are super quiet rooms intended to kill as much sound as possible that let you hear your own blood moving around clear as day.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the difference between the systolic blood pressure (the highest pressure in an artery) and the diastolic blood pressure (the lowest pressure in an artery) is greater the pulse becomes obvious (it's called pulse pressure).
Pretend your blood pressure is 120/85, your pulse pressure is 35 (mmHg).
When your systolic blood pressure suddenly increases -pretend- to say 150/85, your pulse pressure is 65 (mmHg). At that point your pulse is almost twice as strong as it was therefore easier to feel.
During different circumstances blood vessels increase or decrease the blood flow to an area of the body (arterioles do that), combine that with a more noticeable pulse and there, you can feel the pulse in a given region of the body.
In a few words:</p>
<ol>
<li>You need a reason for the difference between your systolic and diastolic blood pressure to increase (by increasing your systolic blood pressure or decreasing your diastolic blood pressure).</li>
<li>A need for an increase blood flow to a specific area of the body.</li>
<li>A reason for your attention to focus there and the conditions for that to happen. </li>
