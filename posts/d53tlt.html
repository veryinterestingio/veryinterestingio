		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A rainbow is just sunlight that has &quot;bounced&quot; on rain droplets after undergoing refraction. Now the refracted rays will reflect at different angles depending on their wavelength (or color to put it simply). This angle also depends on what they are reflecting on (in this case rain drops). The visible colors will reflect between 40 and 42 degrees (just googled the values), that's why you see the colors of a rainbow well arranged, always in the same order.   </p>
<p>Kind of difficult to explain it in words, here's a drawing I found online that might explain it better</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These are both caused by the same requirements to form a rainbow: rainbows need light at a very precise angle relative to the observer in order to form.</p>
<p>Sunlight, coming from such a bright and distant light source, is almost uniformly parallel. That is, every photon is traveling in nearly the same direction as every other photon. This is unique, as most light sources on Earth except for lasers have the photons spreading out in all directions.</p>
<p>When light passes through a raindrop, it refracts, becoming split into a rainbow. These rainbows emerge from the droplets at very specific angles, meaning that if you look at a droplet from one angle, it might appear red, while from another, it will appear blue. This means that if every drop is producing a rainbow, then all the drops seen from a given angle relative to you and the sun will all line up. Thus, rainbows <a href="https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/3e6eaf57ded8e2a227e8e4ce5de390c9" target="_blank">form a circle centered on you (the observer) and angled exactly opposite from the sun.</a></p>
<p>However, when there are clouds behind you, the sunlight gets scattered and refracted repeatedly. Suddenly, none of the light is going parallel and is coming from every which way (which is also why you don't have shadows during foggy or cloudy days), which means you suddenly have an uncountable number of rainbows, all overlapping. And when you mix all the colors of light equally, you get white (or grey, when some of that light gets absorbed in the process).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The water droplets are round, so a rainbow is actually a circle. It's just positioned such that most of it is below the horizon, although from an airplane you can sometimes see a fully circular rainbow</p>
<p>The position of the rainbow changes based on the position of the viewer, so the rainbow is being projected over a much larger area but the rainbow you see is where the angles of reflection and refraction line up to your eye.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
