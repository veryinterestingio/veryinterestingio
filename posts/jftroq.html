Is this an unavoidable symptom of old batteries and hardware, or are companies purposefully making their products depreciate after a set amount of time? Would that be illegal?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sorta. Rechargeable batteries do go bad. They do not last forever, and if phone manufacturers put customers first, batteries would be replaceable. BUT phones nowadays are iP67 or better, which usually means that there’s a glued seal that your average user isn’t going to replace if they swap to a new battery. For your Xbox, chances are that either the thermal paste has bit the dust, or dust has collected in a heat sink. </p>
<p>Things get old and stop working, and because consumer devices are much more complicated than they were 30 years ago, more things can (and do) go wrong. They are planned to last a minimum amount of time, so sometimes it feels like things are planned to go wrong, but it’s usually less ‘planned obsolescence’ and more ‘accounting for entropy.’  Usually, at least; there are probably some cases going through class action lawsuits for it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main thing about electronics is that electronics develop far more quickly than things like say bolts.</p>
<p>Like no one is going to come up with a 6.77mm nut and try and get everyone to adopt a new system of nuts. There's no benefit.</p>
<p>But electronics get way faster very quickly. There is real benefit to changing things in ways that make them completely different than previous generations. Expecting say, Microsoft to still be supporting DOS is silly. And processors and things are usually built only once with enough stock to last X number of years. That stock can be stretched out by increasing the price as the number of processors in stock drops, but the problem is it doesn't make financial sense to invest in a new run of years out of date processor.</p>
<p>However! The problem is when planned obsolescence cycles is that the companies doing so don't advertise the timeframe. If a company was very very clear that some device is only goimg to be supported for 3 years people would probably not be as mad, but saying that of course is going to be bad for marketing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two items here. What you think of as 'planned obsolescence' is really just 'building to cost'.</p>
<p>Planned obsolescence is knowingly designing a product in a way that will require customers to later buy an updated version of your product. It's way more difficult than it sounds, as the fundamental idea of this is to retain your customers. Manufacturers are moving away from this as it does not work, you lose customers. Adding backward compatibility is a good example of this, it's something we expect now.</p>
<p>Say you sell 25million xbox ones. Building to cost means that every dollar you save per unit is $25 million dollars profit. Your design target is to, as cheaply as possible, make the product that looks good quality to the consumer, can deal with the normal amount of abuse it will take and 99.99% (some secret number) of units produced will survive the normal life cycle of the product without failure.</p>
<p>You could build an xbox one to the standard of an airplane black box, however the games will be just the same and the thing would cost $20,000+</p>
<p>They could also, easily build a cheaper version of the same equipment. They won't though, as the customer will not accept that buying cheaper means buying lower quality. Rather than being praised for building a cheap accessible version they'd be hammered for building a flimsy unreliable version.</p>
<p>TL;DR - In almost all cases planned obsolescence is not real.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
