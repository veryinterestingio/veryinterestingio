<p>If the stomach acid is strong enough to dissolve food, why can't it kill dangerous germs that cause all sorts of different diseases?</p></div></div>

<p>Bacteria can also produce toxins on the food while it spoils, even if the stomach acid kills the bacteria, the toxins can still poison you.</p>
<p>Also some bacteria are just acid resistant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well first, stomach acid can kill many germs but not all of them. Second, in some cases of food-borne illness, it's not the germs themselves that make you sick but toxins created by the germs, and stomach acid doesn't do anything to those toxins. This is why can't eat spoiled food even if it's cooked. Yes, cooking may kill the germs, but it still leaves the toxins that make you sick.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People have touched on almost everything, but it effectively boils down to a few factors; </p>
<ul>
<li>the bacteria type </li>
<li>does the bacteria produce a toxin that <em>isn't</em> broken down by stomach acid? </li>
<li>how <em>much</em> bacteria are you getting in the bolus of food? One of the things I hadn't seen addressed here is that you can get sick if the number of colony forming units (CFUs) outnumber the amount of acid that gets them. If you wanted to raid a castle that had a moat around it, and you had an unlimited number of soldiers, and you were a psychopath...well, just continue throwing soldiers at the castle until the moat fills up with dead people, and then climb over it. Sure, lots of bacteria will die in that acid bath...but some might make it through the gates on the dissolving bodies of their comrades and make a nice home in your guts.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing I haven't seen mentioned is that most food based illness in the developed world isn't due to bacteria, but norovirus. Norovirus will quite happily move through your stomach to your small intestine where it sets up replicating and irritating your gi tract. Then when it's done enough damage it exits (in both directions) and gets spread onto every surface in your bathroom when you flush the toilet. Anyone who touches those surfaces can then infect themselves by putting their fingers or something they touch in their mouth, or infect others by failing to wash their hands (with bleach; norovirus largely ignores soap) and then serving/cooking their food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
