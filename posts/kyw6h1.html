It enters your body, and just floats around for a while doing nothing. Your immune system ignores it. The second  is a virus. It invades your cells and causes trouble until the immune system starts producing antibodies and destroys it. These anti-bodies stick around and are encoded into immune memory cells. </p>
<p>The third is an mRNA vaccine for a virus. It doesn't cause trouble or invade cells, because it is actually just a harmless bunch of proteins dressed up in a virus costume. Somehow the immune system recognizes that it is trouble and produces antibodies anyway. How? How does the immune system know what is a novel pathogen that needs destroying and what is harmless?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ol>
<li>
<p>The immune system won't ignore it unless it is super inert eg plastic, titanium. If the immune system detects something that is not part of the body it will attempt to absorb and destroy it. Think dust in the lungs: white blood cells (macrophage) will recognise it as foreign and absorb it with no fuss. As this is clean and simple there is no immune response and the cells that make antibodies are left dormant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cells will release alarm molecules when they recognise that a virus has infected them. Alternatively, the contents of cells killed by viruses can also raise an alarm. This attracts immune cells and when they recognise there is an issue (think walking into a room full of corpses...you'd be pretty stressed out too) they mount a full scale response. Immune cells will pick up &quot;scraps&quot; (antigens) of the viruses and will present them to antibody producing cells until it finds a cell that can recognise the pattern of the antigen and produce antibodies for it.</p>
</li>
<li>As mentioned below; the immune system can recognise that the protein produced by the mRNA is not &quot;self&quot;; therefore it looks like the cell has been infected with a virus. A similar response to 2 occurs.</li>
</ol>
<p>As to why we don't produce antibodies for everything: you need an immune response. Certain cells that are required for presenting antigens and producing antibodies will not activate until a certain level of alarm/threat is detected. In addition, antigens can only be recognised if presented by very carefully controlled special receptors. Think of it like this; if someone bumps me in the street it's not a big deal. If they stab me, I'm going to call the police and they will keep a record of him for future reference. If he's running around with a knife he might not have stabbed anyone, but the same thing as number two will happen because he's obviously a threat.</p>
<p>If you really want to dig deeper you want to start looking at things like PRRs, PAMPs and MHC molecules.</p>
<p>Hope that helped clear it up a bit? :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No such thing as something entering your body and just floating around. Immune system recognizes every bit of nothing and reacts to it, eliminating it. Now, if something is harmless, you won’t even know about it, but it’s still getting destroyed. </p>
<p>For the immune system, it all boils down to chemical reactions. Antibodies will bind to specific elements on the outside of threats. That’s why the mRNA vaccines encode the spike  of the coronavirus. Immune system won’t know it’s the real virus or not. But it will know it’s not supposed to be there. Next time it finds the same spike, it’ll recognize it and block it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, your body doesn't &quot;know&quot; or differentiate exactly, rather an antigen is defined as any substance which provokes your immune system in to a response and there are thousands of these. This may be something (generally a protein) inside a vaccine, a virus, bacteria, or even pollen or other chemicals from the environment. Typically these are chemicals which bind to or invade your cells in some way. What chemicals our immune systems react to versus the ones they don't is thus a matter of our evolution. The fundamental answer to your question is that it is the actual molecular shape or structure of a foreign substance which either causes a response or doesn't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe your immune system doesn't actually ignore foreign bodies, it attacks all of them. The system knows which cells/substances are &quot;self&quot; and when it encounters a &quot;non-self&quot; substances it produces antibodies which stick to it and mark it for destruction. There is some leeway built into the system, so it's not always working at full tilt. This prevents minor substances creating a full immune response all the time (like allergies).</p>
<p>The process by which it knows which substances to ignore is quite complex, and we aren't fully sure how it works. However there has been some promising research in this area:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can’t answer for the first two, but mRNA doesn’t provide immunity directly. It’s “messenger” RNA - normally messages within a cell to make a protein.    In this case the mRNA is encased in a lipid that allows it to pass into your cell.  Once there your body treats it as any other (naturally occurring) mRNA and creates the requested protein. </p>
<p>The trick is in this case the protein that is being created looks identical to the spike protein on the virus.   At this point, it’s treated just like any other virus particle by the immune system and follows the normal path to immunity.  Of course the trick is the nasty bits of the virus don’t exist - they aren’t part of the mRNA message.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
