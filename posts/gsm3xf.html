It’s just exploiting over sights or weaknesses in a code or system. Very little is done in real time, and even that is more more mundane, just exploring directories for data you want, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll try to explain in ELI5 fashion. </p>
<p>Let's say I'm trying to physically break into a building I could have a bunch of motives. Maybe I'm trying to just rob the place (like when hackers are trying to steal data like credit card numbers for fraud). </p>
<p>Perhaps the office has some specific info in there I'm trying to get (like if a government agency is spying on someone).  </p>
<p>Maybe I just want to vandalize the place (hackers who just cause destruction) or perhaps I just want to explore the building (hackers who like the challenge but don't do anything malicious).</p>
<p>Just like breaking into a building people can have many reasons. </p>
<p>Now let's talk methods</p>
<p>Maybe I just try to break into the building by smashing a window (this would be a brute Force attack which is a program I write that tries a bunch of different passwords)</p>
<p>Perhaps I tricked an employee and got a copy of his employee badge (phishing attacks)</p>
<p>Maybe this badge works at other buildings too (a common thing to happen is people reuse passwords, then one site gets leaked and I can write a program that checks other sites to see if those same credentials work)</p>
<p>I could also find a vulnerability with something protecting the building like shoving a pen in the lock will open it. Some people fixed their locks but I want to find the buildings that didn't (if there's a bug in a program, usually a patch is released but if a site didn't update then I can use the known vulnerability against them. If the door lock company doesn't even know about this issue it's called a zero day vulnerability... It means that someone discovered a bug and kept it a secret from the company so no one knows about it except the hackers.)</p>
<p>I could also dress up as someone who works there, trick them into thinking I do, get let in and then unlock the backdoor so I come back at night (this is essentially what some malware does. It tricks you into downloading it and then gives a hacker access to the computer). Or maybe the people working there just give me what I want because they think I work there (social engineering)</p>
<p>These are just some of the methods people use to hack. There's a lot out there and some way more complex. But this is a quick basic guide. </p>
<p>One thing though for sure, no one is sitting in front of their computer with a mask and gloves to hide fingerprints like the movies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From the purely visual side? Your average hacker is almost certainly using a command line terminal to do most of the work, so it's probably a lot like what you are picturing, but without the intense music and with less flashy visuals.</p>
<p><em>Not including social engineering, which is a major part of actual attacks</em>, most hacking can be boiled down to 3 activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manually investigating: typing and reading stuff at the command line (most hacker-esque part).</li>
<li>Finding or coding tools/scripts that detect and exploit weaknesses: combination of command line, text editors and some kind of online chat or reference (preferably with tight anonymity if you don't want to ever be traced).</li>
<li>Waiting for the tools to run: have a second monitor with command line output and play some video games (&quot;sec I'm just downloading the mainframe&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<p>It's much easier to write scripts and do things in a controlled and predictable way on the command line, and the tools that you'll want to use probably don't have GUIs (with the notable exception of advanced tools that have a <strong>lot</strong> of information and are painful without, such as network sniffing tools, decompilers and debuggers.)</p>
<p>Most hacking is going to involve gaining entry to another system or server, and you won't have the luxury of being able to set up a remote desktop (unless you are hacking via an incorrectly secured remote desktop service) so you'll be limited to a remote command line there (SSH).</p>
<p>Also, if you can't use the command line, you probably don't have enough knowledge to do any practical hacking, it's mostly about knowing about how the system and software actually works, and therefore how you can gain access in an unintended way. The alternative is just getting someone's password, which is much easier via phishing or other social engineering, but that's boring (although what you do once you have it is more interesting).</p>
<p>EDIT: I'd like to tack on that I think there should a far more serious level of education in computing from a young age nowadays, it's not rocket science and you use computers everyday.</p>
<p>Plus, this was mostly about remote hacking, which is what most people would think about (some kid in their bedroom hacking into FBI computers) but another incredibly fun and interesting side is hardware hacking and reverse engineering. Probably the best-known example is hacking games consoles. The challenges here are far more diverse and interactive, much safer and not massively illegal like remote hacking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hacking is a very broad term. Depending on what the goal of the hacker is, the process can be very different. Like mentioned elsewhere in this post, at the end of the day, all hackers are looking for vulnerabilities in another's system.</p>
<p>Some examples of hacking would be:
Finding a special edge case in their code which allows you to get information you should not normally be able to access. By inputting certain code into search bars on websites like Amazon/Ebay/Walmart.com, it may be possible to actually execute the code on the companies computer (which they usually don't want for obvious security reasons). </p>
<p>Realizing there is access to a computer in a way that the user of the computer did not intend to have open. Upon connecting to the computer, the &quot;hacker&quot; tries to remain unnoticed as he collects information about the computer, or even leaves himself/herself an opening on the computer so that only they can get in.</p>
<p>Using keyloggers or special software that runs through thousands of passwords per second to &quot;legally&quot; access another user's system while appearing to actually be that user.</p>
<p>What does hacking look like:
Like I just stated above, there are many forms of hacking, but the most common interfaces one would use would probably be a terminal/command line, which is a text-based environment where you can enter commands to control your computer (e.x. Typing in a command to copy a folder from one location to another instead of just visually copy and pasting it to the new location), and a text editor where the hacker can write and test malicious code.</p>
<p>Typing in the movies:
Usually hackers are not trying to manually type passwords to try to guess them, as mentioned earlier, this can be done by computer software and would take you more hours than there are stars in the sky to try every possible password. All of the speedy typing seen in movies would really be the equivalent of someone who knows how to use a terminal/command line very effectively. </p>
<p>Hope this answers your question :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
