		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are required by law to put that disclaimer on there. Supplements don't have to go through FDA approval before being offered for sale, but at the same time there are certain sorts of health claims they cannot make, and they need to state explicitly that the claims they do make have not been evaluated by the FDA and are not intended to treat any disease.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have confirmation of what vitamins do. </p>
<p>What vitamins do and what vitamin supplement sellers want you to believe they do, however, are two entirely different things. </p>
<p>Stops your teeth from falling out? That's something vitamins do. </p>
<p>Treats the common cold? That's not something vitamins do. </p>
<p>For people who's teeth aren't falling out as it is, the second one sells better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the evidence required to support real health or medical benefits are regulated extremely stringently. Supplements however, are not well regulated. If they want to say that their product DOES something medically related, they need to prove it in scientific studies which are expensive and time consuming. However, they can advertise it saying it MAY do something while avoiding the cost of actually providing evidence.
Vitamins have very little evidence to suggest they provide a health benefit outside of people with deficient diets. This is why they can't say they do anything much at all!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing to keep in mind is that the supplement industry is a very dark industry.  Vendors have gotten dinged for things found in supplements they sell.  Also whenever studies are done and reports written there is money behind all of that more geared toward sales to consumers than scientific observation.  We are reaching a time when the one thing we can depend upon is we can't depend upon anyone giving us the honest truth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
