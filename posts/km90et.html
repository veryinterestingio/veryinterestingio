<p>The [1918] H1N1 strain became endemic, an infectious disease that was constantly with us at less severe levels, circulating for another 40 years as a seasonal virus. It took another pandemic—H2N2 in 1957—to extinguish most of the 1918 strain. One flu virus kicked out another one, essentially, and scientists don’t really know how. Human efforts to do the same have failed. “Nature can do it, we cannot,” says virologist Florian Krammer of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The article says “scientists don’t really know how”, so I’m not sure what you expect Reddit to tell you. </p>
<p>The 1918 H1N1 pandemic eliminated whatever influenza strain circulated before it. The 1957 H2N2 pandemic eliminated H1N1. The 1968 H3N2 pandemic eliminated H2N2. But the 1977 H1N1 pseudo pandemic didn’t eliminate H3N2, and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic didn’t eliminate H3N2 either, even though it did eliminate the previous H1N1 strain reintroduced in 1977. </p>
<p>In any case, the general notion is that there’s a short-term, non-specific protection against repeated respiratory viruses, probably related to the innate inflammatory response. We see this across different viruses (there are hints that recent influenza infection gives some protection against COVID, for example). Even though this only lasts a few weeks - no more than a month or so - a pandemic might lead to enough widespread if temporary immunity that <em>on top of previous specific immunity</em> — probably a third to half the population or so is immune to recent influenza strains, through vaccination or infection - that there wasn’t a sustainable susceptible group. It’s like but not quite herd immunity. </p>
<p>But that doesn’t quite explain everything. Both 1977 and 2009 left segments of the population relatively untouched because of prior immunity - in 1977, mainly people under 25 or so were affected, in 2009 people over 60 or so were mostly spared. So there were probably reservoirs where H3N2 could hide - but then why didn’t H1N1 also hide there in 2009? Perhaps there’s also a T cell component, cross-reactive within H1N1 but not across H3N2, but even that doesn’t really explain everything. </p>
<p>So there are parts of an answer, but the math doesn’t quite work out for those parts to explain everything.  It’s as close as you’re going to get for now, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scientists have written papers and done experiments on this exact course events. Saying &quot;scientists don't know&quot; is a partial-truth.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2917921/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2917921/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2917921/</a></a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is a known phenomena.  Experiments of these sorts have been done in mice quite a bit.  Lots of hypothesis in here.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&quot;HETEROLOGOUS IMMUNITY BETWEEN VIRUSES&quot;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&quot;An important question is whether heterologous immunity is the rare event or the usual event. The answer to this question is not yet clear in human studies, as protective heterologous immunity would often go unnoticed, though some vaccine studies with measles vaccine and BCG have yielded unexpected beneficial effects in regards to general morbidity and mortality with diseases unrelated to the vaccine (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2917921/#R8" target="_blank">8</a>–<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2917921/#R11" target="_blank">11</a>). We do know, however, from our studies with a variety of pathogens in C57BL/6 mice that heterologous immunity and immunopathology are commonplace (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2917921/#R2" target="_blank">2</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2917921/#R4" target="_blank">4</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2917921/#R6" target="_blank">6</a>) (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2917921/figure/F1/" target="_blank">Fig. 1</a>). We find, for example, that infections with BCG, influenza A virus (IAV), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), and Pichinde virus (PV) all confer a level of protective immunity against VV (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2917921/#R2" target="_blank">2</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2917921/#R4" target="_blank">4</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2917921/#R6" target="_blank">6</a>). LCMV, PV, and MCMV will all cross-protect against each other with different efficiencies. IAV, despite protecting against VV, will render hosts more susceptible to LCMV and MCMV. VV, curiously, does not protect against any of the tested heterologous pathogens (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2917921/figure/F1/" target="_blank">Fig. 1</a>). The considerable overlap in heterologous immunity between these very different agents would either argue that it is a common event or that there is something special about the C57BL/6 mouse. Perhaps one of its major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules has an unusual capacity to stimulate cross-reactive T cells. Therefore, we also examined heterologous immunity in BALB/c mice and found that immunity to LCMV partially protected the mice from PV and VV (unpublished). These experimental models would therefore suggest that heterologous immunity is a common and normal feature of immunity, thereby posing a cautionary note about using immunologically naive mice as models for human viral infections.&quot;</p>

<p>Compression and abstraction of ideas of the above is the key.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
