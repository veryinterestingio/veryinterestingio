		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding to those who say it does and we compensate: some people's bodies don't! Then you get orthostatic intolerance symptoms like you're describing: light headedness, dizziness, vision changes, sweating, flushing, fainting. Types of orthostatic intolerance are common in teens and elderly people, as well as sick or dehydrated people. In some people it becomes a serious long term illness as a result of a dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, the part of your body that helps control automatic functions like changing your blood pressure and heart rate in response to things like standing, temperature regulation, moving food through your stomach, and pupil size</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>every time you flex your leg muscles, it pushes blood up towards your heart. That's why if you stand still for a while, you'll notice an urge to fidget and move your feet. it's the blood pooling in your feet that makes you want to do that. </p>
<p>Also, your veins  (the blood vessels that bring blood towards the heart) have one way valves, but there are a lot more of them in your lower body because the blood has to flow uphill towards your heart. Your head and neck veins have no valves at all, so there's nothing preventing the blood in your veins flowing to your head.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>
<p>When blood returns to our heart from any part of the body below the heart, it flows upwards. It’s fighting against gravity. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To prevent the backflow of blood and pooling in our lower extremities, veins below our heart have valves. Thus blood does not pool in our feet while standing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When blood flows back to our heart from any part of the body above our heart, it flows downwards. It does not need to fight against gravity. As a result, veins here do not need valves to prevent backflow and pooling of blood.</p>
</li>
<li>When upside down, the blood flowing back to our heart from our head is now flowing upwards. It is fighting against gravity. Since there are no valves to prevent backflow, deoxygenated blood pools in our head and makes us dizzy.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is how I understand it, hope it helps :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

If you get upside down not only does gravity pushes down all the blood towards your head but your heart too. Too much blood pressure there and you pass out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
