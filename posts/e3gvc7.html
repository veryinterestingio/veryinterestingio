		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple theories. </p>
<p>1) it's a polite habit. Shock or horror makes your mouth drop open and we are (almost) all conditioned to cover our open mouths. </p>
<p>2) it's protective; our mouths are pretty vulnerable and we cover them bc in that moment we can't keep them closed. </p>
<p>3) it's protective; we are trying to hide our expression from others and we can't school our expression so we physically cover them. Also to smother gasps or shouts that expose us. </p>
<p>4) we are subconsciously trying to contain emotions or reactions that feel too big - trying to physically hold them in. </p>
<p>5) a careful combination of some or all of the above.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Seems like a combination of protecting yourself from the thing, and simple cultural norms. “Shock” involves opening your mouth and raising your hands to protect yourself. So if you are feigning shock, you would put those two things together. One little gesture emerged from this, and when you see it, you do it because others do it and it makes sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading a theory that crying was also a useful way to show other people you were in pain or distress,  without giving away your location.</p>
<p>A glance over to your whimpering hunting companion across the clearing would tell you something is wrong, without the need to reveal your locations.</p>
<p>I would assume the ability to mask or amplify our emotions serves quite an evolutionary benefit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Open mouthes are considered rude in many cultures. It is the root of phrases like 'slack jawed', which is no kind of compliment. Many people are taught to cover their mouthes if they have to open it, like for a yawn or even a hard laugh.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
