		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 4 mechanisms of diarrhea. Osmotic, permeability increased, secreting and abnormal motility (peristaltic)</p>
<ul>
<li>Osmotic, you have non absorbable substances that impides water to be absorbed and/or causes water to be transfered to the intestine.
<ul>
<li>Artificial swetteners can cause this type of diarrhea (they can't be absorbed, that's why they don't have calories), as well as exocrine pancreatic insuficiency (can't digest fats, that draw water in).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Increased permeability, means that the intestine, instead of being a semiosmotic barrier as always, becomes more permeable in some way. This is the case in some inflamations and some circulatory diseases with high hidrostatic pressure and transudation.
<ul>
<li>This is basically an edema. The body fighting the infection, increases the vascularity to the zone (more blood flows there), and with some mechanisms, allows electrolytes to go into the lumen.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Secreting. Normally, the intestine absorbs more (through the villi/mountains) than it secretes through the crypts/valleys (it has that shape in order to maximize absorption). If it doesn't, you are adding oil to a fire.
<ul>
<li>Simple way, if an infection targets the crypts and makes them multiply and continue secreting, it will increase the amount of stuff in the intestine. Or, if it destroys the villi and doesn't absorb, but I guess that would be more akin to osmotic, although they are all conected.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Peristaltic, instead of having a slow digestion to process everything and absorb all, including water, in an infection your gut goes, &quot;there's something wrong, emergency evacuation&quot; floors the gas pedal, and you drop what you eat as a mishmash that couldn't have time to be absorbed.
<ul>
<li>A day to day example is the difference between eating a lot of fruit [fiber and water and sugars] and red meat [proteins and hard to digest fats]. Also, this motility is the reason why bunnies eat their feces the first time the excrete them, because they can't digest them completely the first time around. (the more you know)</li>
<li>(Aclaration: fiber is important for a good digestion. It was the most &quot;extreme normal example&quot; I could think of). Fiber attracts water and accelerates the digestion, being &quot;diarrhea-like&quot;, whilst lots of fat, are hard to digest and slow digestion, being &quot;constipation-like&quot;. Thus, eating only lettuce, would lead to a diarrhea like poop. Also, the peristaltic mechanism is often secondary to other processes.)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>All of them can coexist, and in an inflammation, they usually do, but those are the mechanisms of diarrhea.</p>
<p>TLDR:</p>
<p>Specifically in regards to the virus, it probably will replicate in enterocytes (or some other intestinal cell depending on the virus). It will cause damage there, (decreasing the amount absorbed increasing osmotic pressure if it is in enterocytes [point 1]) and inflamation, increasing blood flow. This will increase the peristaltism [point 4]. In response to the infection, the immune system will respond secreting immunoglobulines and some other things point 3] and it will probably have some damage in the cells that will cause a &quot;leakage&quot; [point 2]. As there is more stuff in the lumen, that won't be absorbed (virus, inmunoglobulines...) there will be an increased osmotic pressure [point 1].</p>
<p>Edits:</p>
<ol>
<li>Changed &quot;types&quot; for &quot;mechanisms&quot; it's more accurate.</li>
<li>Aclaration for the fiber part, didn't explain myself too well.</li>
<li>Some small changes to ortography and the like</li>
<li>Also. Wow, so many votes... And questions. Think I answered most if not all of them.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the best ways to explain this is to use cholera as an example. This isn't applicable for all cases but Its a good explanation of the general mechanism.</p>
<p>Cholera excretes toxins that irritate the intestines and cause chloride channels to open releasing a massive excess of chloride ions into the lumen of the small intestine. These ions lower the water potential inside the small intestine (Make the water less wet) so that more water from outside the small intestine moves into the intestine through osmosis so that the water potential inside and out is even.</p>
<p>However, this doesn't work too well in our bodies since very watery stool gets passed quickly and the whole situation gets reset. More chloride ions (now moving with its own concentration gradient because you left the excess behind in the toilet) and therefore more water, therefore more diarrhea.</p>
<p>Your body fixes this by removing the cholera preventing the chloride ions and therefore the rest of the steps.</p>
<p>Another fix that can aid It is Oral Rehydration Salts (dioralyte at the shops) and this has a specific water potential designed to help rehydrate your body and help break this cycle.</p>
<p>Whilst this doesn't apply to all causes it's quite a common mechanism and helps explain how the negative feedback loop can start leaving you to dehydrate and potentially die without your own body or medicine intervening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bacterial infections can cause diarrhea in a number of ways. Toxins, such as cholera toxin, can activate ion channels in your cells and this changes how water flows in your gut, just as u/brainonwheels has said. Cholera toxin activated a chloride channel that causes water to flow out of intestinal cells and into the intestines where it will dilute indigestible materials and leave the body as watery diarrhea.</p>
<p>Some bacteria can change the structure of the gut lining to change how water is absorbed in the intestines and, again, lead to watery diarrhea.</p>
<p>Viruses have even more ways to change gut structure that we are still beginning to understand. Rotavirus, for example, can affect how the nervous system affects intestinal cells, again causing changes to water flow in and out of the gut lining. Norovirus does not affect ion channels in the intestines but seems to change how fast the stomach moves food into the intestines. How norovirus does this at the cellular level is not entirely clear. However, it appears that the immune reaction to the virus causes inflammation of the intestinal lining, leading to decreased water absorption and diarrhea.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Anything that disrupts the normal function of the intestines and how the intestines can absorb water will cause diarrhea.</p>
