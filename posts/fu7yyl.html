		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They use <del>salicylic acid</del> [this is incorrect, see edit below], which is a chemical that breaks down your skin and helps it shed off faster than it normally would on its own. The same chemical is used in greater concentrations to treat plantar warts (Compound W or similar treatments), however those are targeted applications. Foot peels use the same chemical in a lower concentration over the whole foot.</p>
<p>Salicylic acid can also help your skin reduce the amount of sebum, or skin oil, it puts out. Excess sebum is a cause of acne which is why you also see it in acne treatments.</p>
<p>EDIT: Since this is getting a lot of attention and questions, let me say this: I am not a dermatologist, so if you have questions about &quot;can salicylic acid be used to treat X&quot; I can't really answer that any better than Dr. Google can. If you're unsure whether it's safe, consult a medical professional!</p>
<p>EDIT 2: /u/llustrous_llama added a helpful comment below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To piggyback on your edit, r/skincareaddiction could tell people what salicylic acid can be used for, and what might help with X. They're also not doctors, but man do they do their research.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>EDIT 3: /u/LyZiinc has offered a correction to my original comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gonna hijack this comment to correct your answer.</p>
<p>I'm the developer for <a href="https://www.pillowskin.com" target="_blank">PillowSkin</a>, a cosmetics analytics/tracker software. While salicylic acid is one of the major ingredients for skincare exfoliation, it is not actually one that is responsible for the skin shedding in foot masks. The actual key ingredient that is used for these foot masks are called Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs), and they are the ones that causes your dead and hardened skin to soften and shed off faster. Some common examples of AHAs are lactic acid and glycolic acid.</p>
<p>On the other hand, salicylic acid belongs to another group of acids called Beta Hydroxy Acids, which are oil soluble and able to combat acne by dissolving or loosening hardened sebum plugs. Hence, salicylic acid is usually in face washes and acne treatment creams/pads.</p>
<p>To prove my point, we can have a look the a foot peeling mask from a popular Korean skincare brand, Etude House:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ingredients:
Water, alcohol, <strong>lactic acid</strong>, sodium lactate, <strong>glycolic acid</strong>, glycerin, arginine, peg-60 hydrogenated castor oil, <strong>salicylic acid</strong>, urea, tocopheryl acetate, retinyl palmitate, ascorbic acid, zea mays (corn) silk extract, cucumis sativus (cucumber) fruit extract , pinus palustris leaf extract, camellia sinensis leaf extract, laminaria japonica extract, algae extract, salicornia herbacea extract, gelidium cartilagineum extract, vitis vinifera (grape) fruit extract, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) fruit extract, pyrus malus (apple) fruit extract, citrus medica limonum (lemon) fruit extract, citrus aurantifolia (lime) fruit extract, sodium hyaluronate, disodium edta, phenoxyethanol, fragrance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.iherb.com/pr/etude-house-bebe-foot-mask-1-pair-0-68-fl-oz-20-ml-each/83444" target="_blank">https://www.iherb.com/pr/etude-house-bebe-foot-mask-1-pair-0-68-fl-oz-20-ml-each/83444</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both lactic acid and glycolic acid are placed higher up in the ingredient list, meaning that they are present in the product at higher concentrations. In this case, the formulation is using a combination of both AHA and BHA for maximum exfoliation.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So skin is made of lots of layers of cells, and they stick together through stuff that acts like glue. That way, even though you're doing stuff like sitting on your butt watching Tiger King, or running, your skin doesn't come flying off. </p>
<p>Foot masks are basically different kinds of acids that dissolve the glue sticking the cells together, so the skin comes off. It takes a while for all of the glue to dissolve, which is why it's a week of shedding. But, if you do stuff that breaks up the glue naturally (like running or rubbing that skin a lot), it'll break off earlier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They've got a high concentration of acids - particularly  alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) and  salicylic acid - which you might recognize from face peels. Baby Feet is basically a chemical peel for your feet. These kinds of acid soften the keratin and loosen skin cells. Keratin being the structural stuff that holds your outer most layer of skin together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
