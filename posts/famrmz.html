		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think fundamentally the floors of stock exchanges exist for social reasons.  Some have started to close but others like NYSE remain quite active.  It is a status symbol to have a seat on the floor of the NYSE even if it's of limited use</p>
<p>It basically comes down to:</p>
<p>Why do people still go to the casino if they can play poker on line?</p>
<p>It's more fun to gamble in person.</p>
<p>There is nothing that happens on the floor these days that doesn't happen a thousand times a day electronically but you can still go make trades with a human being if you want.  These trades may involve more elaborate financial instruments than shares of single stock (but you can do that electronically too).  Also one actual reason to be on the floor is that it is a forum for discussing investments.  Although you get a much larger forum on a Bloomberg Terminal. Still talking to a person face to face is way more efficient than messaging.</p>
<p>Edit: typis</p>
<p>Edit 2:
A Bloomberg Terminal is a program that ever trader uses.  It's a news feed, stock ticker, spreadsheet, messaging app, and trading platform all in one program.  It was designed in the 1980s by Mike Bloomberg and it's UI has never been updated, and looks as terrible as it's designer (although there are new front ends you can plug it into).  It costs $20,000+ a year and is the reason Bloomberg is a billionaire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nothing. They could very easily shut that building down tomorrow and nothing would change. </p>
<p>But companies listing for the first time like to go to a place and ring the bell and CNBC and Bloomberg TV need a backdrop for their reports, so they keep it open.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's like if the stock exchange was a restaurant, online day trading would be people coming in booking a table for two for a quick lunch. No special concessions required, no additional help.</p>
<p>Now say you want to host a party in that restaurant with potentially hundreds of guests. Well that takes time and active effort. You need everyone involved to agree on when to meet, the details of the party, how it's going to be funded etc.</p>
<p>It will also have an impact on the restaurant. That many people showing up for a big event will affect the layout of the restaurant, which seats are more desirable, the party may reserve items on the menu so there won't be any left for other people, which will also affect the desirability of other items on the menu. </p>
<p>For a task this large it very much helps to get an event planner to organise the party and help the restaurant get set up, make sure they get their money and the guests are all happy, and to maybe research any issues this disruption may cause to other customers.</p>
<p>The stockbroker is basically the event planner. Organising and processing huge trades and calculating the effect this amount of money changing hands will have on other stocks in the space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Extremely large trades.  Like institutional stuff that requires verbal negotiation and work to secure the nescessary quantities.  </p>
<p>You cant pop onto etrade and buy 50million dollars without moving the price.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
