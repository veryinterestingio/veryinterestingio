		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever sat by a lake or river and dug a little hole in the ground? After a while, water will collect in the bottom, because the water flows through dirt and stone around the river too. When it rains, a lot of water flows down into the ground and that ground that carries water is called an aquifer. Depending on what kind of dirt and rocks are there and how the hills and mountains are sloped, it will collect in certain places. </p>
<p>Very ancient people needed water to live, just like we do today. They usually chose to live near rivers, lakes, and streams. They also dug little holes in the ground nearby, and noticed the water in those holes was nice and filtered by the dirt and sand. If they dug a hole and covered it up, their water would taste good and stay clear of leaves, sticks, and algae. So they dug deeper and deeper holes, and found they could move further from lakes and rivers which would flood from time to time. </p>
<p>Where to dig a well was trickier the further you got from water though. Sometimes they dug big holes for nothing, and that was disappointing, but they learned a lot from it. Parents taught their children what to look for, what kinds of rocks and plants made for good well ground.</p>
<p>EDIT: WHOA!!! Glad so many people were amused by writing in my teacher-voice! A recurring question I’ve seen is “How can dirt filter water? Wouldn’t it be dirty?” So here’s a <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/groundwater-wells?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects" target="_blank">link</a> to explain more about wells since it’s a pretty deep subject. In short, fine topsoil rich in organic matter doesn’t go very deep, clay settles out, and gravel and sand are excellent filters that continue to be used as part of modern water filtration systems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Knowing where isn't that easy. Throughout history people have dug for water and failed, start over somewhere else. That's why dowsers made money, that guy with a forked stick who claimed to be able to detect where water was. Either such a person was a complete charlatan, or he was just good at reading the land for water and the stick was his trick to wow the clientele.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You do likely see how rain water will flow on top of the ground and collect in steams and rivers to flow down hill. However some of the water find its way through the grains of dirt instead of just on top of it. Water flows much slower through the dirt then on top of it but it will still flow in a similar way. The water will not be able to flow the same through different layers of dirt and bedrock so the grondwater will often collect in similar streams and rivers under ground. But they tend to be much wider and flow much slower. It can even form huge ground water lakes the size of countries.</p>
<p>If you look at a terrain you can often see where the ground water flows. Both based on how the terrain is shaped how the vegitation look like and even the color of the dirt. You would then be able to dig a hole where you expect there to be water and hope to find water there. As for clean drinking water the dirt is usually a very good filter of particles and toxins so the ground water tends to be even cleaner then the surface water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
