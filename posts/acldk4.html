		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! I'm no social science expert, but maybe I can answer this!</p>
<p>As you may know, laughs are a biological feature, and of course are controlled by our own anatomy. Anatomical differences between humans can certainly cause our laughs to sound different or distinct.</p>
<p>But it's not really as simple as that! We might not think about this very often, but we all actually have MORE than one laugh! We do have a &quot;true&quot; laugh, which is the ugly, gross, snorting, often contagious one - and the a series of emulated or pre-prepared laughs. These are the main laughs we use in public or for things that are just tongue-in-cheek, or even as a genuine laugh but in a way that WE want it to sound. Since humans also experience learned behavior, some of these laughs take on notes from laughs we hear often, or laughs we've heard before and enjoyed.</p>
<p>As far as the 'true' laugh, it is - like our speech - a product of anatomy. Our anatomy will force a lot of the qualities of our natural laugh since this laugh is being made relatively without our control. This might be very relevant to people who have or have had deviated septums. That being said, the 'cadence' of our laugh could be influenced by those around us. <a href="https://mashable.com/2014/11/30/why-we-have-different-laughs/#0_E9e4bxJPqw" target="_blank">Here is a cool article on this</a></p>
<p>There is even research that suggests laughs could be hereditary (not suprising as alot of anatomical traits are hereditary) but the article linked above even talks of a pair of twins who were separated for 40 years, and their laughs persisted in similarity. So no worries friends, your laugh certainly may be unique, and doesn't have to be a product of your environment!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>iirc, laughing was a social signal developed as an &quot;all clear&quot; for danger. It's deeply wired into our monkey brains and happens automatically much of the time. It's not something you learn, and you're correct, laughs are unique because we are unique  </p>
<p>Edit: quick google led me to a pretty good article <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-evolutionary-origins-of-laughter-are-rooted-more-in-survival-than-enjoyment-57750" target="_blank"><a href="https://theconversation.com/the-evolutionary-origins-of-laughter-are-rooted-more-in-survival-than-enjoyment-57750" target="_blank">https://theconversation.com/the-evolutionary-origins-of-laughter-are-rooted-more-in-survival-than-enjoyment-57750</a></a>  </p>
