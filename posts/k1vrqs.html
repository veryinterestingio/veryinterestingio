		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans and bats hear things at the same volume.  It's just that bats hear more frequencies.  So thunder sounds the same to a bat as it does to you.  A drop of water sounds the same to a bat as it does go you.  The wings of a moth aren't too quiet for you to hear.  The frequency is just out of your range.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The bigger issue for bats is not destroying their own ears when they emit echolocation calls, as these are amongst some of the loudest sounds generated by any animal. This is accomplished by having a well-developed stapedius muscle in their middle ear, which prevents the ossicles (collectively the bones of the middle ear, the malleus, incus and stapes) from moving when tensed, and thus blocks the conduction of sound from the eardrum to the cochlea. Bats have literally evolved selective deafness to protect their own hearing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sound is essentially waves of energy. The amount of energy impacting one's eardrums is the same, and an eardrum does not need to be more fragile to pick up more sounds. Sensitivity to sound is like being able to tune into more radio stations, not having sounds amplified or being more powerful to you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What we call sound waves are vibrations or rapid movement of atoms. When you drop a ball it will hit the ground. The ball will vibrate once hitting the ground causing the atoms in the air to also vibrate. These vibrations form waves that travel in all directions through the air, including the air in your ear. Once a wave reaches the ear drum your brain then works it’s magic and process the amplitude and frequency of the sound wave. </p>
<p>Sound waves have 2 main factors: Amplitude and Frequency. Amplitude is basically the volume. Higher amplitude will sound louder and vice versa. </p>
<p>Frequency is the key here though. Frequency AKA pitch(soprano vs bass singer) is the number of waves produced per 1 second. Humans hear frequency at a range of 20-20,000 Hertz. A bat’s frequency range is 1,000-150,000 Hertz. </p>
<p>ELi5:  they can hear high frequency sounds that humans can’t. </p>
<p>If you haven’t heard of echolocation then give that a quick google search.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They hear the same frequencies and amplitudes as us. The difference is the size of the brain region responsible for processing sound. Animals that rely on sound have more brain area dedicated to processing sound stimulus allowing them to reconginze a wider variey of sounds. This doesn't mean the inner workings of the ear like the ear drum are any better than another animal only that the neurons have a wider range of stimulus signals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
