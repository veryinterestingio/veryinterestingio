<p>You were sedentary on the sofa, tired eyes and slow heart rate. So you got up and started walking around, Activity increased your heart and brain. This effect is exacerbated if you had a late dinner and a higher blood sugar.</p>
<p>Spend half an hour reading a book in bed before you try to go to sleep, you'll find this more effective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there may be a pyschological aspect as well (I think I spelled it right). When you lay in bed and try to force yourself to sleep, night after night, your brain starts to train itself into thinking, &quot;this place is where I'm supposed to be tired but not really.&quot; So effectively you're sabotaging yourself in the long run. When you lay down in bed, regardless of how tired you are, you're brain thinks it's time to be awake but exhausted. So that's what it changes gears to. The recommended course of action is that when you're tired, move to somewhere else instead of your bed. Train your brain into thinking that your bed is somewhere to sleep, not be tired. If you're just tired, walk around or go sit in your living room.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sleep is a state of mind. If we were to hook you up to an EEG and show you what your brain waves look like during different parts of they day, we could explain what's happening when you're getting drowsy and what's happening when you hit the bed. My guess is that you're in alpha consciousness when you're dozing on the couch. Watching TV can put you into a slight trance state and from there it's easy to drift off into sleep where theta and delta brain waves occur. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>What is probably happening is that your mind associates your bed with watching youtube videos or reading reddit on your phone or tablet. These activities happen when your brain is alert and in beta consciousness. Plus the blue light from your screens produce dopamine in your body which further enhances that state of alertness. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As others have stated, you'll probably want to set up a sleep time ritual. Do the same thing every night when you want to sleep. Brush your teeth, put on PJs, say goodnight to your family, roommates, animals, etc. After about a month (yes, this takes time) your body and subconscious mind will associate your bed time ritual with sleep and it will get easier and easier to fall asleep in your bed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
