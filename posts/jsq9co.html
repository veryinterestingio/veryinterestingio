		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I cannot answer it for actors but a friend of mine is an undertaker. He told me that they constantly make jokes and stuff but that’s apparently not suitable in front of people that lost a relative or friend. He told me he trained to quickly stop laughing by connecting the process of getting calm and serious with a specific thought and e.g. movement of his hand. So whenever he enters a room where he definitely is not allowed to laugh he focused on that thought and routine and that helps him to act serious in a matter of seconds. Just by activating this association.
I don’t know if this works for all people but I tried it a bit myself and I can confirm the effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>When Sacha [Baron Cohen] starts doing his thing, and you’re right next to him, he has this super serious face. I have to act like it’s the most normal thing ever. But he’s so funny. There were moments when the scene was extremely funny and you just can’t stop laughing. It’s bad, because people were able to realize that it’s a joke. <strong>He taught me a trick to cross my fingers, to put pressure on my fingers, to stop laughing.</strong></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak on behalf of actors but I can speak from experience behind the camera. It's a weird experience when actors corpse because there are generally anywhere between 15-30 people in the room during a take and once the laughter starts it then becomes infectious and everyone laughs and if it can't be controlled quickly then generally the 1st AD will just call for a break and everyone can go calm down and get it out of their system. </p>
<p>That's only if it's a drama or an emotional scene that is being shot, if it's a comedy it tends to be a positive because people are more loose and feed off of that energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not an actor actor, but I used to do some theatre. Which was supremely difficult for me because I start laughing VERY easily. Thinking of sad stuff is the only trick that works on me because I can cry just as easily as bursting into laughter. </p>
<p>Someone mentioned that when you're too deep in character, you don't laugh. That's true, but I've noticed it happening only when I was actually performing in front of a real audience, as opposed to when I was just in rehearsals. Being in costume and makeup and being under the lights makes it seem as if you ARE the character. I've seen my co-stars undergo that transformation as well when their expressions seemed more real in front of an audience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>On a shoot a few years back, me and a really good friend of mine were both cast as a pair of criminals - as unprofessional as it is, we both turned up late and a bit hungover. </p>
<p>As we walked in to the courtroom for our scene, everyone went quiet and stared at us. After apologising profusely, we sat down together and caught each other's eye and were suddenly having to hold back the worst case of the giggles either of us have ever had.</p>
<p>Eventually, the director stopped and asked us if we needed to go and laugh somewhere and that's exactly what we did. Left the room, walked to an empty part of the building and just laughed and laughed and laughed until it wasn't funny any more.</p>
<p>And it worked.</p>
<p>On reflection, I was so unprofessional, if you're a casting director and thinking of me - move on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
