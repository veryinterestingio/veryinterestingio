		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This might sound like a dumb question but I promise I'm serious. I was watching a video on the depth of the ocean and it got me curious how deep sea creatures don't immediately squash under all that pressure. I did some reading on it and from what I saw, fish/squid/etc lack swim bladders and as a result lack anything left in their bodies to be compressed. Yet I'm still a bit confused on how these animals even open their mouths under all that weight.. how they have an open stomach. Wouldn't that be flattened as well? The only thing I could think of is that the pressure inside their bodies maybe equalize the pressure on the outside.</p>
<p>Which brings me the to the last part of the question. As a part of that video, I saw that a leatherback sea turtle has a maximum diving depth of 1,280 meters. Yet just before that it mentioned that the pressure that far down is roughly equivalent to a polar bear standing on a postage stamp. I can kind of overlook how fish do it, but I can't really imagine a polar bear standing on a sea turtle's face and it be just fine. I can't even imagine me being able to punch a sea turtle in the face and it being fine. Yet apparently it's somehow invincible.</p></div></div>

Their lungs are compressable, so they adapted and can collapse their lungs voluntarily and force the oxygen into the bloodstream, they also have more oxygen-carrying proteins, and the lung collapse prevents excess gas exchange, which prevents them from getting decompression sickness. I imagine it's a similar situation for deep-sea turtles or any other creature with lungs adapted to go so deep underwater.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pressure comes from all sides at the same time. So it doesn't really crush you like being punched or something standing on you.</p>
<p>It's more that you're compressed, that anything with low pressure is forced out of you like a balloon.</p>
<p>The inside of these animals desn't have anything low pressure to be forced out, so it all equals out and they don't even feel the pressure (deep sea fish would bloat up and decompress at the surface though!)</p>
<p>They also have a specific protein that handles their cells problems with the pressure (chemistry works a bit different at such high pressures, and they have to compensate for that)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pressure is sometimes unintuitive to us because it acts in all directions. To squish a balloon, you might step on it. This causes it to get flatter in one direction and wider in two others. If you step on it while it is confined on two sides, then it can only get wider in one direction. If it is completely surrounded by something solid, then it cannot be flattened at all. An air balloon will squish anyways, but a water balloon (much like the insides of a fish) will not change at all.</p>
<p>This is because the pressure is applied to the balloon equally from all directions.</p>
<p>A fish underwater has this pressure inside its mouth, outside its mouth, inside its guts, outside of its guts. It can open its mouth because the pressure pushes its jaw both directions equally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fill a baloon with water. Immerse it in water. What do you think the water is going to do with it?</p>
<p>Of course it's squishy, especially outside water, but it's not like water can somehow compress other water which is what's mostly inside most creatures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If gases didn't act all weird with our systems at high pressures, then you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between 10ft or 10,000ft underwater. Water is essentially incompressible, so the density hardly changes at depth, and if you descend slowly enough, the pressure inside your body will be equal to the pressure from all the water above you. </p>
<p>As for deep sea creatures, they are flabby and weak because most nutrition has already been eaten by the time it reaches the bottom so nutrition is scarce. Predation is limited because animals can't see each other. Conserving energy reigns supreme down there, so there isn't a need for ultra powerful bodies. And, anything pulled up from down there basically turns into goo on the surface because the tiny amounts of gas in their system basically tears all of their flesh apart at a very small scale as their bodies ascend up through the water column and tiny bubbles tear their flesh apart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
