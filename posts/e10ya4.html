		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. Surprisingly, I learned a lot about this during my plastic surgery rotation. I got to participate in a few liposuctions. Fat is stored in cells, special cells called adipocytes, like any cell they require the importing and exporting of nutrients and metabolites etc. This means there needs to be vascularity. During liposuction you can only take out about 10 pounds of fat, the reason for this limit is actually blood loss. Back in the day the reason people would die during lipo procedures was because they would take out too much fat, which would cause them to lose too much blood and they would go into shock. Adipose tissue is a living part of you, it produces hormones and shit and it's gotta have blood supply.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but the increase in blood volume exists in a non-linear fashion in relation to weight in the case of obesity. Up to a certain point, 70mL/kg of body weight provides a good estimate of blood volume. In obese populations, the formula must be adjusted because although fat is vascularized, it is not as well supplied by blood as lean mass or even bone. This is why poor wound healing so often occurs in the obese population.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oxygenated blood needs to be circulated through all the tissues. Being obese expands the circulatory system so vessels can reach areas of the body. So an obese person would carry more volume, but this also makes the heart work harder since the heart doesn‚Äôt actually get any bigger and overtime you‚Äôre tightening up the valves in and out of the heart with plaque.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I just met the weight minimum to give blood but the last couple times I did I passed out.
