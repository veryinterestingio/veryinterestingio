		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two basic elements that allow this to happen. </p>
<p>1) The source of your income. (In order to avoid taxes you’ll want to make your money through investments rather than a pay check.)</p>
<p>2) Tax deductions. Deductions are things like business expenses that are subtracted from your income for the purposes of calculating the tax you owe. </p>
<p>Your taxes are based on your “net” income or the total amount you make minus eligible deductions. If you work a job and earn a regular pay check your income relative to your allowable deductions will be limited. Having a business or being a contractor rather than a regular employee can open up possibilities for increasing your deductions but it’s harder to show zero net income if you have a regular pay check. </p>
<p>By having your income come from investments you gain a more favorable basic tax rate (there are different types of investment income but we’ll keep it simple) and you gain a wider range of potential tax deductions. You also gain the ability to control the timing of many types of investment income e.g. choosing when to sell an investment can either be income gain or loss depending on the value at the time you sell vs. when you bought it so you can offset gains in some areas with losses in others. </p>
<p>The problem is that many assets don’t have a simple value like a stock so “creative accounting” can  often be used to try to allow for these losses to be calculated in ways that are more beneficial to the person trying to minimize their taxes. </p>
<p>TL;DR There’s far more gray area in calculating net investment income vs. your employer telling the government exactly how much money you made. It’s also easier to hide this income completely (which is tax fraud but it still happens).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main way if they are above board is that the rich tend to get money from investments (things like stock and real estate) rather than normal job income. This falls under capital gains tax rates rather than income tax and is significantly less.</p>
<p>The rest is usually stuff that you could technically do as an individual, but are less likely to get away with because you can't afford the lawyers and accountants to make it a pain in the butt for the IRS to audit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Worked on tax returns for wealthy ppl for a few years.</p>
<p>Short answer: the tax code was written by rich people to benefit rich people.</p>
<p>Long answer: if you’re rich you earn investment income (interest and dividends) through stocks and bonds. Interest and dividends are taxed less than wages earned from working at a regular job. If you are rich you own property. You can reduce total taxable income by property taxes and mortgage interest paid on your personal property. If you are rich you own rental properties. Rental properties get depreciated, so a lot of your rental income gets offset by depreciation expense... along with the property taxes and mortgage interest on the rental.</p>
<p>Most rich people are paying CPAs and lawyers to do their tax returns by the book... so they aren’t dodging taxes they’re following the rules that treat rich people better. Sometimes a tax preparer might do something “aggressive” in the eyes of the IRS (where they bend a rule but don’t break it) and it could result in a tax adjustment and penalties, but the IRS doesn’t have the funding to fight the onslaught of lawyers that rich ppl can throw at them. This is why most audits are done on poorer ppl in the US. Propublica wrote something about this recently.</p>
<p>At the end of the day I think something is going to have to change... the current model isn’t sustainable in the US when you look at annual deficits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is one popular tax loophole:</p>
<p><em>Parent Company, Inc.</em> is founded somewhere without corporate tax, for instance the Cayman Islands. </p>
<p>In another country there is <em>Child Company Ltd</em>. that uses the name and logo of <em>Parent Company, Inc.</em> Child company pays a one-million-dollar yearly fee to use the name and logo of Parent Company. This fee is 100% tax-deductible. The Child company just so happens to not make a profit (and therefore pay no taxes) because the fee ate up their profits for that year. </p>
<p>Now, back at Parent company, the boss has his official residence in Monaco. In Monaco you don’t pay income tax. So that million-dollar fee, which has now reached Parent company without having been taxed a single penny, is paid to the boss in Monaco as income. Without taxes. </p>
<p>This is all absolutely legal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Without going into specifics, there are things you can do to pay less tax that simply cost some amount of money up front.</p>
<p>You might be able to pay less tax by setting up a company in some way that costs you $10,000 a year. You have to have enough money (and otherwise owe enough tax otherwise) to be worth it.</p>
<p>This applies both to avoiding tax legally and evading tax illegally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
