The Radium isotope with the longest half life is Ra^256, which is an alpha emitter.  The longest lived Polonium isotope has a half life of 4 months and is also an alpha emitter.  She worked with Uranium and Thorium - much longer lived but also alpha emitters. So you should be able to store them in a cardboard box - you just don't want to handle them in ways that might cause you to ingest or breathe in radioactive material.   So what are they contaminated with that requires a lead box?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The standard for nuclear safety is ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable). The Curies' possessions are not highly radioactive, and realistically don't pose an exposure hazard even if they were handled frequently by a specific patron or staff member. Even so, under the ALARA principle you should avoid getting any small dose unless it were necessary. (And if you already have a lead box, why not keep using it)? </p>
<p>A detailed analysis of one of Marie Curie's notebooks can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="https://aurorahp.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Curies-Contaminated-Notebook-Lindsey-Simcox.pdf" target="_blank">https://aurorahp.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Curies-Contaminated-Notebook-Lindsey-Simcox.pdf</a></p>
<p>Of note is that there is a measurably elevated gamma activity, suggesting that the lead box may provide some benefit under ALARA. </p>
<p>They also point out that even though the measured activity of the article is relatively low, the alpha and beta emitters are contained in a hundred-year-old book that could likely shed material when handled. They are significantly more hazardous when ingested or inhaled, so a container of any kind is wise to reduce such contamination.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Radium-226 does emit some gamma in addition to alpha decay, but the real problem is that it eventually decays into lead-214 and Bismuth-214 which are intense gamma emitters.  According to the source below, in an equilibrium mix of Radium and its daughters, the daughters’ total gamma emission is as intense as the radium’s alpha.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This fact about her notebooks being stored in lead boxes gets posted very frequently.</p>
<p>Handling her notebook will give you an **annual** exposure of 0.010 mSv and hand exposure of 0.035 mSv.    Annual limits for the public (not radiation workers) is 1 mSv per year and hand exposure of 50 mSv to the hands.  </p>
<p>So handle them all you want for a year and you are not going to be at all that much risk.</p>
<p>Don't eat it though as this would be bad.  Yes, you would exceed your exposure limit but also you would be eating paper and destroying an artifact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s been plenty of response about radioactive decay so I won’t repeat it. What wasn’t pointed out is there is a distinct difference between radiation and contamination. Contaminated materials can be thought of more like a dust to be kicked up and inhaled or ingested. Radiation is the energy released. The lead blocks the radiation (energy) released from her contaminated notebook. Materials have what’s called a tenth thickness which is how thick a material needs to be to block 1/10 of the radiation from a given source. Lead has a tenth thickness of about 2” compared to water at around 24”. The box could be made of a lot of different materials but lead is cheap and efficient.
Edit: if the worry we’re the contamination then the book would be required to be polybagged with a hepa filter when handled.</p>
<p>Edit2: here’s the decay chain for radon. There are several beta decays as well as the alpha which shoots out some gammas in the process:</p>
<p>Radium-226 Decay Chain: Radium-226 (1600 year half life) yields an alpha particle and Radon-222; Radon-222 (3.82 day half life) yields an alpha particle and Polonium-218; Polonium-218 (3.05 minute half life) yields an alpha particle and Lead-214; Lead-214 (26.8 minute half life) yields a beta particle and Bismuth-214; Bismuth-214 (19.7 minute half life) yields a beta particle and Polonium-214; Polonium-214 (0.16 millisecond half life) yields an alpha particle and Lead-210; Lead-210 (22 year half life) yields a beta particle and Bismuth-210; Bismuth-210 (5.0 day half life) yields a beta particle Polonium-210; Polonium-210 (138 day half life) yields an alpha particle and Lead-206; Lead-206 is STABLE.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
