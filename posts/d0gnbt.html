		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All hair follows the same process that your body hair follows, which is grow to a certain length, die and fall out, and then start regrowing a new hair in its place. The reason this is more noticeable for body hair than it is for hair on your head is the maximum length the hair will reach is much longer for the hair on your hair than it is the hair on your body. </p>
<p>You can equate it to a human needing sleep. We are awake for a certain consistent amount of hours until our body’s need another consistent amount of rest. Hair follicles do the same thing, where the go through a long period of growing, and then a short period of rest (where the previous hair falls out) before it can start growing again. This process goes through three stages. </p>
<p>The first stage is the stage where your hair is actively growing. The overwhelming majority of your hair will be in this stage, but each hair will be at its own individual place during that process. While each hair will be at different parts of these stages from each other, they will generally all grow at the same rate determined by your genetics.  This stage generally lasts 3-5 years. </p>
<p>Then it goes through a transitional/renewal stage where melanin production and hair growth stops. This lasts a couple weeks. </p>
<p>Then the final resting stage is when the old hair falls out. This lasts roughly a couple months. Then the first stage starts again and it starts growing. </p>
<p>Most people keep their head hair and beard much shorter than the maximum length it can grow. Although there is a lot more variance in beard length, ranging from not being able to grow one at all or having it never grow longer than a very short length all the way to being able to grow out a few feet long wizard beard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I get what you all are saying, and I understand it’s pre-determined by a person’s genetics to be a certain length. But I personally want to know WHY human bodies overall decided that they need a lot of hair coming from the scalp and only a thin layer over the rest of the body. Why doesn’t my forearm need long hair?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
