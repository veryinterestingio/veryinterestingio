You make a good point that it's not spread as effectively as someone who is regularly propelling droplets into the air, but a lot of people just randomly cough. Tomorrow, keep a mental note of how many times you sneeze or cough. It probably won't be zero. If you want to get even more into it, consider how many times you touch your face. An asymptomatic person who rubs their eyes, mouth, or nose and then grabs a door handle is going to spread fomites.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While it's true that it CAN spread on surfaces being and through sneezing, that isn't required. While people actively ill and sneezing or coughing are the most contagious, even the water droplets exhaled during normal activity can cause the virus to spread between people.</p>
<p>This is why it's recommended people keep 3-6 feet (depending on the source) from each other, even when they show no symptoms. Just being near an infected person is enough to spread it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
