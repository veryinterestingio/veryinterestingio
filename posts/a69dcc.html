		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hair dryer is pretty much just an electric element that gets hot as soon as its energized (turned on).</p>
<p>Air conditioner is a series of mechanical components that work together to take heat from one space and absorb it into a refrigerant (liquid/gas inside the unit) by manipulating the pressure of the refrigerant by a process of compressing and expanding to expel that heat to another physical location. Therefore its a bit more of a process then just turned on a switch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The hair dryer uses electricity from the wall to heat wires that air is blown past to make the hot air. A car on the other hand uses heat from the engine coolant to heat air, but the engine is a big chunk of metal. It takes a while to heat up and transfer to the coolant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A blow dryer draws an incredible amount of electricity from your outlet though thin tungsten wires that makes heat. Your car uses the coolant that cools the engine to heat the compartment. Your car can not provide the amperage needed to heat the wires of a heating element without adding a whole new electrical system. Which would be expensive and heavy </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The entire purpose of a hair dryer is to get hot, so it does that pretty well.</p>
<p>A car's purpose is for transportation.  The heater is just a very nice side effect.  </p>
<p>Also consider the materials involved, and the quantity.  Your car engine is over a thousand pounds of metal.  If you're interested in using the heater, it's probably cold outside, so that's over a thousand pounds of very cold metal.  As mentioned previously, heating is just a side effect, so all of that metal needs to warm up first before the heat will pass to you.  The hairdryer, by comparison, is a tiny little scrap of metal, in a plastic shell.  Heating that up is much much easier than heating up an engine block.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

While a cars heat is second to getting the cars engine hot if the engine is not getting hot or to the right temperature you’ll not get heat. Heat is not it’s own thing it gets hot though the heat of engine</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
