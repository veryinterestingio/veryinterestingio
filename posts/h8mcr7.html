This is why listening to whatever song is stuck in your head usually gets it out</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had a music anthropology teacher who said music and dance are likely evolutionary traits in humans, developed because they helped us preserve and recall information across generations, before writing. If that is correct, songs might get stuck in your head because we have actually evolved to memorize them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I went to a music conservatory and took a music neuroscience class that deals with music related phenomena like this. There isn’t a lot of specific detailed research when it comes to things like this because it does magical things to our brains, but there are a lot of memory related phenomena that music causes. One theory I’d suggest is that since music uses a lot of your brain all at once when listening and especially when playing, music is quickly embedded into your memory. An especially catchy tune that is easy to remember in combination with using up lots of your brain at once is a perfect recipe for short term storage in your brain. This is why memorizing things like the constitution in song is more effective. It essentially drives the information into your brain by using more of it at once through music. It’s like filling a bottle with a funnel rather than pouring water above it and hoping it gets in. Because it gets in faster and more efficiently, that music will be embedded into you short term memory strongly and you’ll be singing it in your head until your short term memory gets rid of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>LPT: You can get rid of it by doing some mental calculations. The reason this works is that the song on replay and the calculations occupy the same brain area, and thus the calculations are forcing the song out of there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
