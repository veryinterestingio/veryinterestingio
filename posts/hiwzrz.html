		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surprisingly, none of the top level answers here seem to be aware of the fact that salts do in fact <em>leave</em> the oceans as well as enter them. This happens through sinking sediments in the water column which make it to the seafloor, and through chemical exchanges which occur in hydrothermal vent systems. Periodically in Earth’s long history, there have been significant episodes of removal in basins/inland seas which become isolated and dry up, leaving behind evaporite salt deposits. There is also a small flux of some salts which get transferred to the atmosphere during storms and then blown all the way onto land. </p>
<p>A good concise answer explaining why ocean salinity has remained stable for the past few million years can be found in one of the many examples of variants on this question on the sub <a href="https://reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3c9u7f/since_evaporating_ocean_water_is_pure_does_this/cstrbso" target="_blank">here</a>. I’m sure there are more detailed answers in the sub about  the sources and sinks if you have a look yourself, either from me or one of the actual qualified resident geoscientists.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rain falls on land. Land contains salt which dissolves in the rain. Rain eventually makes it to streams and rivers that eventually lead to the ocean. Water then evaporates from the ocean to become rain again but the salt that was dissolved in the water cannot evaporate so it stays in the ocean.</p>
<p>Rinse repeat for billions of years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have read that rivers delivering salts to the ocean are not the main sauce of salt.<br />
It is the water circulating thru the shattered rock around underwater volcanos, typically in the mid ocean ridges and around the Ring of Fire. As the water is circulating thru this very hot rock, it leaches out salts and minerals. It only takes 70m years to circulate all the oceans water thru this system. The minerals go onto make up much of the mineral deposits later found on land.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The earth is made up of a number of minerals. Some are soluble. The oceans have been here a very long time... Those get swirled around by volcanos, the oceans and tides themselves, earthquakes, and rainfall on land. In turn, that creates water with dissolved minerals.</p>
<p>Another way to look at it is that the tendency of systems is towards entropy, and minerals being disolved vs concentrated is a higher entropy state, and the natural tendency.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Over time, small trace elements are released from rock and soil into the rivers and waters that flow into the ocean.  Ocean creatures eat some of the elements, but two elements in particular (sodium and chlorine I believe) have accumulated greatly over the 4 billion years or so of Earth.  I believe it was all fresh water in the beginning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
