		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily.  Consider that boiling waste in a closed container or irradiating it sufficiently would yield the expected smell, but there would be no life.  Smells typically come from molecules with a couple dozen atoms, while microbes will be made from billions if not <em>trillions</em> of atoms, all in a generally specific configuration.  Antiseptics can damage the microbes quite effectively while leaving the scents unscathed.  That said, cleaning to the point that there's no smell is a better indicator that most of the microbes have been destroyed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Skatole is a chemical found in faeces that surprisingly is often used in the food and perfume industry. In large doses it smells strongly of faeces and it is this that will stick to your skin.</p>
<p>Low doses it has quite a flowery smell hence it's use in perfumery and food flavours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I love how the top 89point reply is about a chemical and how its found in faeces and also used in perfume. Totally one of the best non answers I ever seen. How it got 89 points passes my perception of logic.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But the other people are right.</p>
<p>All the bacteria can be destroyed, all the nasties and poo washed of in dozens of cleaning cycles, but your hand may still smell. That could be due to the fact that those parts of the feces that create the smell, are just too stuck to your hand. Smelling sense is quite sensitive.</p>
<p>You can do the same experiment with some actual perfume. Rinse your hands with the perfume, and then wash it off using soap. The weird &quot;oily&quot; feel of the perfume will fade quickly after washing your hands once, but the smell will persist for days.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's all about individual molecules making up the smell, still being stuck to the skin.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I had a bottle of aftershave, or rather, its neck, explode on me once, dont ask me how. My upper legs, one foot and my hands were soaked. For 3 days I smelled like a perfume store, even after showering twice a day, and taking a long bath right after the incident. Whilst the floor tiles were quickly &quot;stench free&quot;, some molecules or something were stuck to my skin for those 3 days. I was even scrubbing with a rough brush, and was debating grinding the skin off my hands with sand paper, thats how annoying it was.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So, no, you are not spreading sickness or making others contract all kinds of nasty illnesses, after you washed your hands 3 or 4 times. The bacteria are dead, the only stuff that stuck to you, is those compounds that make up the smell.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Btw. everyone who ever cut onions and garlic also knows this. You wash your hands 200 times, and they dont taste like onions/garlic, but they sure as hell smell like it, for some time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
