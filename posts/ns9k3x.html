<p>That sinusoidal shape is not the path traveled by the radiation. That shape is representing an aspect of the radiation (usually the magnitude of the electric field).</p>
<p>For comparison, it's like <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg10qGJ2zCg" target="_blank">The Wave</a> at a sporting event. The signal or message or event or whatever is traveling in one direction (right to left in that video). It's composed of people standing up and sitting down. Often, with those waves, the people standing also yell when they stand and are quiet when they sit.</p>
<p>We could even imagine a wave that doesn't have the standing and sitting part, and <em>only</em> has the yelling part, where each person starts yelling when the person next to them starts yelling and stops when they stop. Here there would be no motion involved at all, but you would still have a wave going in one direction, and we could represent it by the volume of the people moving in a sinusoidal fashion.</p>
<p>So, EM radiation is kind of like that. It moves in one direction, but the changes in magnitude of the fields increase and decrease in a sinusoidal way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nope, things like visible light and radio waves do not move through space with sinusoidal motion. </p>
<p>Look at the y-axis of the graphs you were shown and you’ll see that the y-axis is not a spatial coordinate - depending on what you were doing, you’ll see it’ll be voltage, magnitude of electric field, magnitude of magnetic field, or something similar - so it’s not a spatial coordinate, it’s a representation of something else cranking up and down in some way.</p>
<p>The light itself is moving straight forward, but its electromagnetic properties are oscillating, and that’s the graph you saw.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, yes, it moves, but it moves in some abstract degree of freedom, kind of the way that temperature &quot;moves&quot; periodically with a period of one day.</p>
<p>Second, the motion is governed by the equations of whichever theory you are using — when you say photons, then that would be quantum electrodynamics, but usually it's much more convenient and interesting to treat light of visible wavelengths or longer using classical electrodynamics.</p>
<p>The solutions to those equations are generally represented by something like a Fourier series — an eigenstate expansion — and those eigenstates exhibit sinusoidal behavior. But the thing is, you can solve a lot of equations with a Fourier expansion, and the solutions will be sinusoidal by design; that's what Fourier expansions are.</p>
<p>Real electromagnetic radiation can jiggle around in all sorts of weird ways. But the interesting ways of interacting with light (i.e., human vision, or tuning into a radio station, or detecting radar echoes, etc.) amount to picking out a component of the Fourier expansion.</p>
<p>When you are dealing with a full QED treatment, the main difference (other than the fact that the solutions obey Poincaré symmetry (i.e., they obey special relativity) is that the square of the magnitude of the solution over all space has to come in discrete multiples of some unit which represents a single photon, whereas in classical electrodynamics, the normalization can be any nonnegative value. But the nature of the solutions is otherwise basically the same.</p>
<p>In short: The sinusoidal nature of photons (as well as a lot of other things) is largely a consequence of Fourier analysis being useful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Photons cannot do anything but travel in a straight line, and since visible light and radio waves are made up of photons, then that means they too must travel in a straight line. But when we talk about the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation, we're not talking about the photons themselves oscillating, we're talking about the electric and magnetic fields oscillating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes it does, but what “it” is gets complicated quickly.</p>
<p>The electric field and magnetic field both oscillate in strength as the light travels forward.  Both of them have a direction, and the oscillation goes up and down perpendicular to the direction of travel as well as perpendicular to each other.  The E side makes the M side happen, and the M side makes the E side happen, and the two go on sustaining each other indefinitely.</p>
<p>No physical medium is moving, no, but a physical medium isn’t required for light.</p>
<p>Polarization is defined as the orientation of the E field.  What I just described is linear polarization, which is the kind of light you get with polarizing sunglasses.  Circular polarization also happens, which is where the intensity of the E field <em>doesn’t</em> go up and down, but instead the orientation of the field spins around in a circle, again in a plane perpendicular to the direction of travel.  It’s a bit weirder at first glance, but it’s another way to make the math behind light work out.  Circular polarization is how 3D movies work:  one eye sees the clockwise light and the other sees the counterclockwise light, so you get two different images to make stereo vision out of.  This leads to less eyestrain and headaches than the older method of color-based, red/blue filtering.</p>
<p>Polarization can also be a mix of linear and circular, which becomes elliptical.</p>
<p>Polarizers work because when light is absorbed, the direction of its E field matters.  The film on sunglasses that polarizes the light just works by preferentially absorbing light that is polarized in a certain direction, and letting through the light that is polarized perpendicular to that direction.  For sunglasses, it absorbs left-right polarization and transmits up-down polarization.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
