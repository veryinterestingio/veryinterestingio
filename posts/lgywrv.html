		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember seeing several articles about scientists finding COVID-19 in sewage samples taken well before the pandemic. If this is true it seems really significant. But I have never read anything further about it. Have these studies been subsequently discredited? If not... what does that mean?</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.theweek.in/news/world/2020/05/05/french-hospital-retests-old-samples-discovers-covid-19-case-from-december.html" target="_blank">this article in The Week</a>, French scientist re-tested samples from pneumonia patients at a hospital and got a positive match as early as December 27, 2019.</p>
<p>Italian scientists found COVID samples in sewage from as far back as Dec 18, 2019 in Milan and Turin <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.20140061v1" target="_blank">according to this abstract on medrxiv</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.20140731v1" target="_blank">another medrxiv abstract</a> Brazillian researches report detecting COVID in two sewage samples in Santa Catalina/Florianopolis as early as November 2019.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-spain-science-idUSKBN23X2HQ" target="_blank">According to this Reuters article</a>, scientist from the University of Barcelona testing old sewage samples got a match for COVID-19 as early as <em>March 2019</em>.</p>
<p>Many of these dates far pre-date when the virus was identified in these countries. Some of them pre-date when the first discovery of the virus in China! It seems like these results turn the whole theory of how COVID-19 spread on its head. Has there been any further research to clarify how this is possible? Or that might identify some issue that might have caused these studies to find false positives that predate the pandemic?</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> some very thought provoking comments, thanks for everyone's responses!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The very early findings are treated with skepticism, though not harsh skepticism - The samples are no longer available and so the tests can’t be validated by others. Since that data is wildly out of synch with everything else we know, the general consensus is that it represents a false positive. Some of the more recent dates (December) are more plausible but even there, the sense is that false positives are just as likely as genuine cases being exported that early. </p>
<p>The problem is really that the samples are either not available (all used up in the first testing) or almost all used up, so repeating with different primers etc to confirm can’t be done.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
