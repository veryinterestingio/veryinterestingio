For example,  if you don't click, you might have just come from a search engine list and found that it wasn't what you were looking for. If you do, it shows you were interested in the article, so their future advertising has you down for that subject.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it is an ad decision combined with a metric system to let them know how much a user engaged with the page. The ad companies donâ€™t want to pay out for ads displayed halfway down the page if a user only read the first sentence. And an article publisher might want to track how many users read more than the first couple sentences.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Let people skim a page of multiple read more expansions rather than bombarding them with so many words when you just want to give broad overviews, especially on mobile where everything tends to be in blocks on top of each othrr.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those clicks are accounted for.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be useful to know which stories provoked enough interest so people clicked to see more?</p>
<p>Like, you wrote 10 articles, and only 3 got massively &quot;read more&quot; clicked? You'd know straight away what is interesting to your readers and your strong side of writing and so forth. So maybe you'll avoid topics of other 7 articles next month.</p>
<p>Also it's used for engagement analytics for ads and all sorts of complex stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Otherwise interactions allow you to easily target look-a-like audiences. This is where facebook/google/etc machine learns commonalities between users that the websites can use to advertise to to increase conversions.</p>
<p>It also helps rule out bots when looking at stats but less so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
