		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not beer vs bad diets.</p>
<p>There's good consensus in the comments about visceral vs subcutaneous fat. However, the question implies that beer leads to beer bellies (visceral fat) and bad diets lead to rolls (subcutaneous fat). That is not the case. Calories from beer aren't stored differently than calories from wine or dessert (or anything really).  It could have to do with personal genetics, possible liver issues, or other unknown factors. So just like you can't target weight loss on your abs specifically, beer doesn't automatically go to your belly as visceral fat.  </p>
<p>In other words, you can definitely have a beer belly and never drink beer. You can also drink lots of beer and be quite roly poly.  </p>
<p>Better yet, if you're careful and maybe lucky, you can drink your beer and beer fit.  But that does take work.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Beer bellies&quot; are specifically visceral fat, meaning it's fat that's on your organs. This is caused by the consumption of <strong>excessive</strong> amounts of calories, not just &quot;eating a little too much&quot;. This is also why &quot;beer bellies&quot; are usually very hard to the touch. </p>
<p>Most fat accrued by just &quot;eating a little to much&quot; is subcutaneous fat, meaning it's just under the skin. This is the soft, rolly stuff you can pinch and squeeze.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The beer belly is due to visceral fat. Visceral fat sits around the organs (behind the abdominal muscles) and gives that harder bowling ball appearance you're referring to. This is obviously more prevelant in skinny people who drink a lot.</p>
<p>Visceral fat is bad for the body and its attributed to many health problems but fortunately is one of the first things the body will burn with a proper diet and workout regime.</p>
<p>The second belly is subcutaneous fat. This is the fat under the skin and over the muscle walls of the abdomen and US usually attributed to chronic eating habits and lack of exercise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question may have less to do with distribution of fat, and more with the development of liver failure. With chronic alcohol over-consumption, the liver can become damaged (fibrotic) and create an elevated pressure in it’s venous system (this is called portal hypertension. The return blood flow from the organs in the abdomen pass through the liver, and this elevated pressure leads to “leaking” of the fluid in the bloodstream into the abdominal compartment. This fluid is called ascites and can accumulate to substantial levels (ie up to 4-5 liters of fluid). This can give a characteristic protuberant appearance that resembles pregnancy. </p>
<p>Another possible explanation for the appearance you are describing is that an individual does not have liver failure, but is functionally malnourished. Because the calorie intake is so weighted towards alcohol, which has calories but minimal nutritional value, there is minimal muscle mass due to poor diet but there is a significant amount excess calories which are stored as (primarily) abdominal fat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Men tend to put on more visceral fat, this is around your organs, located in your upper body.</p>
<p>Women tend to put on more subcutaneous fat, this is fat that’s under your skin, and spread all over your body.</p>
<p>So when men have a diet that leads to fat buildup (lots of carbs and sugars like you get in beer, alcohol, and “drunk food”) it mostly goes into fat around their organs in their torso, leading to a “beer belly”, while women who consume the same put on fat that’s more distributed.</p>
<p>The good news for men is visceral fat is also relatively easy to shift with diet and exercise, one of the reasons men often find they can lose weight more readily than women when they start to make lifestyle changes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
