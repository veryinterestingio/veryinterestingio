		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>CO does unbind from hemoglobin! The half-life of CO-Hb is shortened by high oxygen concentrations, which is a simple, low-risk, cheap treatment. The half life of CO-Hb is measured in hours, while a red blood cell lives for around 120 days.</p>
<p>Massive blood transfusions are not without risks, are more costly, inconvenient - and they may not solve the whole problem! Carbon monoxide also binds to myoglobin (hemoglobin equivalent in muscle cells) in the heart with similar effects on oxygen which is dangerous.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. As others commented, CO has a higher affinity to Hgb than oxygen (200x more), but will still dissociate from the Hgb and be exhaled over time. If half of your Hgb molecules were bound to CO (forming carboxyhemoglobin), it would take over 5 hours to claear yourself of it. If you flood your system with 100% O2 by non-rebreather, that time is cut down to just under 1.5 hours. If you breathed in 100% O2 while in a 3 atmosphere hyperbaric chamber, you'd vent off the gas in just over 20 minutes.</p>

<p>To tranfuse blood as you are describing would require exsanguination together with massive transfusion, which would not only be near-impossible, but would take longer than just giving oxygen by mask AND cause massive systemic issues (ie. TRALI, hypercoagulability, acid-base distrubances, etc...)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>CO does not bind permanently to hemoglobin, it just binds with a much higher affinity than O2. If you supply air with a high O2 partial pressure and near-zero CO partial pressure, you will gradually get rid of the CO-bound hemoglobin (carboxyhemoglobin).</p>
<p>Blood transfusions might help with the carboxyhemoglobin, though it would be a massive intervention (you'd need more than one), but it wouldn't fix the carboxymyoglobin, or of course the other toxic effects of CO.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
