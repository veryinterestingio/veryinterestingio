		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>UV light can bleach pigments. The part of a molecule that is responsible for its visual colour is called the chomophore. When we say a pigment has been bleached, the chromophore has been chemically changed in such a way that disrupts its ability to absorb/reflect light in the way that causes its colour. The pigment could have been physically broken up by the UV light, or a slight change in the structure has changed the chromophore. </p>
<p>Some pigments are more resistant to this damage than others, this is called &quot;light fastness&quot;. You can get more resistant pigments (intuitively called resistant pigments) which can last longer or fade to a lesser extent. Different pigments can have vastly different structures (a <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/C.I.-Pigment-Blue-78#section=2D-Structure" target="_blank">Blue pigment</a> compared to a <a href="https://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB5469587.htm" target="_blank">Red pigment</a> for example), and so will fade at different rates and to different degrees.</p>
<p>Cheap print such as newspapers etc are going to use the cheapest inks which will be using the cheaper pigments, and therefore fade in the sun quickly. Items such as posters and print for billboards etc that are designed to be exposed to the sun for significant periods should be printed from inks based on resistant pigments, this will ensure they last a lot longer before they fade (although they will fade eventually). it's highly unlikely that all of the pigments used on a print will have the same resistance and fade at the same rates.</p>
<p>When they do fade at different rates, the strengths of the different inks used (Typically Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black) are going to be changing relative to each other (<a href="https://i.imgur.com/asNpHW5.png" target="_blank">Imagine playing with the colour sliders in paint</a>), so the colours will appear to drift as these different compounds are bleached at different rates. As you describe in your question, the blue pigments tend to be more resistant/stable than the others, and so &quot;last&quot; the longest.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ooh I actually know this one.</p>
<p>Within visible light spectrum: Blue photons are highest energy. Red photons are lowest energy.</p>
<p>Blue things absorb red (low energy) photons and reflect blue (high energy) - the blue pigment takes less of a beating from the photon energies.</p>
<p>Red things absorb blue (high energy) photons and reflect red (low energy) photons. Absorbing all those high energy photons means there's more energy converted from photon to chemical energy and that chemical energy often results in a change in chemical structure which breaks the pigment molecule.</p>
<p>Also, some pigment molecules will be more chemically fragile - more likely to break down - but the general trend is because blue light contains more energy than red light.</p>
<p>(The other answers saying &quot;this pigment always fades faster&quot; are explaining what but not how/why.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fading is caused by absorption of high-energy photons causing chemical degradation of the dyes.</p>
<p>The color of a dye is determined by which wavelengths of light it <strong>reflects</strong>, rather than what it absorbs.</p>
<p>The blue end of the color spectrum is higher-energy than the red end. Thus, red and yellow dyes absorb a lot of blue light, which causes them to degrade faster. Blue dyes, on the other hand, <em>do not</em> absorb blue light, and so are protected from degradation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
