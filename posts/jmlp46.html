I'm sure I'm not the only person who thinks this is vey uninteresting and just wants to get to the cookie recipe but I've heard that doing this gives websites better chances of turning up higher in search results.</p>
<p>Why do these stories improve search rankings? Who decided to set the settings that caused this?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its a side effect of how google ranks pages.</p>
<p>Time spent on a page is one metric that is used. If you have to spend 5 minutes looking for the cooking time it ranks that page higher than a user who used a different site and found that info instantly.</p>
<p>Its a poor metric for things like this whilst obviously it makes sense for other searches.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Search results are weird things. The more specific the term you use, the better your results will be. </p>
<p>Let's turn your cookie recipe into an example. </p>
<p>If you search for &quot;cookie&quot; you're going to get everything from cookies for sale, to a wiki entry for what a cookie is, to recipes, etc. If you narrow it down to &quot;cookie recipe&quot; you'll start knocking out all the cookies for sale, unless it's a cookbook. </p>
<p>But that's still far too many results, right? So now you look for &quot;sugar cookie recipe.&quot; Now we're getting somewhere, but not quite there yet. &quot;Nana's sugar cookie recipe&quot; eventually becomes &quot;Nana's Polish Sugar cookie recipe&quot; (or something similar) before you're finally at just the kind of cookies you wanted to make. </p>
<p>But that's just one way of getting to that recipe. </p>
<p>Now we're getting into what's called a &quot;long tail search.&quot; See &quot;Cookie&quot; is a very broad term with so many results it's overwhelming. Those results got less and less the more specific you got out on that tail. </p>
<p>But what if somebody is looking for something different, but equally specific. Instead of Nana's polish sugar cookie recipe, they're looking for the little village where nana grew up? </p>
<p>None of that info is going to make it into the recipe itself. And google looks for context. If you just randomly throw words on a page to hit the search engines, you're not going to rank well. </p>
<p>So you tell grandma's story of growing up in that little village in Poland, where she milked cows and churned her own butter and made the most delicious sugar cookies and you always looked forward to visiting nana, cause her sugar cookies were the best. And some people like the context, and some are just like &quot;gimme the how-to already.&quot;</p>
<p>But, at the end of the day, that story is how google got enough context to be able to put elements together to give you a search result.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thereâ€™s a few things working for it:</p>
<p>1) it makes you spend more time on a page, which google sees as a good thing and makes it a priority </p>
<p>2) more story means bigger page. Bigger page means more ads</p>
<p>3) since the story will probably mention words that relate to the recipe it has a better chance to have more of the key words you search for</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So a long time ago there weren't search engines. Then along came Yahoo and Google and a host of others trying to compete. People quickly noticed that if they were over of the first results in Google for a specific search term them they'd get a whole hell of a lot more money than if they were on the third or fourth page. </p>
<p>So it became a race to become the top result or, failing that, being on the first page. The trick to all this is that Google doesn't share the recipe for their secret sauce. Nobody knows for sure why Google gives one page over another. We've got some pretty good ideas but that's it. Also it changes all the time. So yeah.</p>
<p>Now back in the day people were madly experimenting to try to figure out what Google wanted. They realized <strong>keywords</strong> were very important. The more <strong>keywords</strong> in an article the more likely it was to come up. So some people got the bright idea to just write a bunch of <strong>keywords</strong> and stick it on a page with advertising others would write the <strong>keywords</strong> and hide them from human eyes but the computers that got the information for Google could still read them. </p>
<p>Google realized this was going on and so added some new metrics. One, was time spent on a page. How long did a user stay on that page? Presumably longer was better because someone going to a webpage realizing it's crap and jumping away in a moment means it's bad. Another was did they scroll past the fold. That term comes from newspaper days and basically means were they interested enough that they didn't just look at the headline but instead picked up the newspaper and unfold it to read the whole story. Then machine intelligence has also gotten better and can make a pretty good guess at human writing so it can say: this isn't actually an article it's just goobletygook. </p>
<p>Now if you say: but wait a minute. Those things aren't needed for recipes then you are 100% on the right track because unfortunately Google doesn't bother to change this for different webpage types and Better Homes and Gardens and Pampered Chef and all the other companies that wanted a piece of that rich profitable internet pie knew that they had to play by the rules to get clicks and clicks translate directly to money. </p>
<p>TL;DR: Google likes people scrolling down on a page with lots of <strong>keywords</strong>. So people making recipes made it so you'd have to do that to get to their recipe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
