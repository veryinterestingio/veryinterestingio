		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mars' magnetic field is thought to have a very similar origin as Earth's magnetic field. It is created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo_theory" target="_blank">dynamo action</a> in the molten core.
For this dynamo to occur several conditions need to be met.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You need a conductive fluid, i.e. molten iron. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kinetic Energy (provided by the planetary rotation)</p>
</li>
<li>An internal heat source that causes convection in the liquid conductor to occur (heat from the formation of the planet, radioactive decay, differentiation of the planets interior, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is thought that Mars' internal heat source is too weak to drive the convection needed for the dynamo action to occur. We don't  know for sure yet. But now we have a very accurate seismometer on Mars onboard of the Mars Insight lander. We will get more accurate data about the planetary interior. It will be an important part to get some certainty about Mars' magnetic field.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a simple explanation of planetary magnetic fields for terrestrial (rocky) planets.</p>
<p>If you take a big hot molten mass, particularly one high in metals, and you spin it around it will generate a magnetic field. We've simulated this by filling a giant spherical coil with molten <del>cesium</del> sodium and spinning it around, observing the magnetic field. There are two components, speed of spin and temperature. If you want to maintain the same magnetic strength while raising one of these components, the other must lower. IE: If you increase the temperature you must slow the spin.</p>
<p>As that core of molten material starts to cool it will inevitably start to slow, relative to the rest of the planetary mass anyway. That will result in a small drop in the strength of the magnetic field, but in particular the drop in temperature is what decreases the strength of the field. Since one/both of the components are lowering in value, the overall strength decreases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a solid metal, the atomic structure is, basically, positively charged metal ions in a more or less regular pattern surrounded by electrons that can move freely. This is why metal is electrically conductive. </p>
<p>The core of mars (and other terrestrial planets) is largely composed of metal. In Mars' case, the metal has cooled down enough to solidify (the material making up the planet became hot enough to melt during its formation, but nothing has been heating it up since), but in the case of Earth (and Venus) the larger size of the planets means the core was hotter to begin with and will take longer to cool down.</p>
<p>In molten metal, the metal ions are free to move, similar to the electrons, and because of convective forces and the Earth's rotation, they are moving. Electrically charged objects that move create magnetic fields (the reverse is also true). This effect is what allows us to produce electrical currents at power plants, but in the case of planets, the electrically conductive molten metal swirling around in the core induces a magnetic field. The faster the rotation, and the higher the temperature (the ions and electrons are more free to move at higher temperatures), the greater the effect. On a planetary scale, the result of all this is the magnetic field the Earth has, and that Mars used to have. </p>
<p>Since the effect is dependent on the metal being molten, once the core cools down enough to solidify, the magnetic field disappears.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good information in this thread and I like to add:</p>
<p>The Earth is not easily comparable to an average planet. The Earths iron-nickel core is unreasonably large. The thermal mass is immense. The reason for the over proportional core size is speculated to be linked to the formation of the moon. The Earth had a standard core to mantle ratio but got hit really hard on one side and got stripped of a lot of mantle material. This event probably also gave the needed rotational energy to make the magnetic field as strong as it is. All in all Earth is a freak for having a magnetic field that strong.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This thread is way old, but I haven't seen this explanation here, so I thought I'd just lay it down.  Don't think you'll find this in any textbook.</p>
<p>The Earth's magnetic field protects us from the ionized radiation that is emitted from the sun and continually bombards us.  It does this by bending the charged particles' paths around the Earth.</p>
<p>The Earth's core's motion creates the magnetic field.</p>
<p>The work the magnetic field does first displacing these particles and then restoring them generates heat in the core.  This keeps the core molten.</p>
<p>The solar radiation flux is too thin at Mars to generate enough heat in the core to keep it from cooling.</p>
<p>A byproduct of this heating action will be a core temperature that is dependent on solar flare activity.  Increased number and power of solar flares will cause higher core temperatures.  This will eventually cause core to expand resulting in more earthquakes and volcanoes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
