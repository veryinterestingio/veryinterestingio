<p>How is it that a library will have &quot;6 copies&quot; of an Ebook? Often Ebooks will have waitlists like regular books, but why is there not a way to have any library patron load the book on their device without waiting? How do they keep track of when Ebooks are &quot;checked out&quot;? Is it just to make them as much like physical books as possible?</p></div></div>

<p>If publishers didn't place these , a single library could buy a single audiobook and share it with all library users everywhere at once and the publisher would make no money.</p>
<p>If a library thinks many users will want the same book simultaneously, they have to pay for more &quot;copies&quot;.</p>
<p>Its all about profit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>[EDIT: Oh wow! My first silver! Thank you, you glorious human! OMG! Two silvers! You people are simply majestic!]</p>
<p>I work as a Library Tech at a large metropolitan library. My dept does the purchasing and assignment to branches of purchased items - books, ebooks, audiobooks, CDs, DVDs, you name it.</p>
<p>The short answer is that publishers don't sell the electronic items to libraries, they license them with certain conditions; To offer 6 copies for circulation we have to buy 6 licenses, usually at a rate much higher than you could buy it through Amazon. Each of these licenses are single-use, meaning only one check-out at a time is allowed.</p>
<p>But wait! There's more!</p>
<p>Part of the purchase license is a limit to how many times that one licensed ebook can be circulated - and that's often a rather small number. So those 6 copies/licenses, maybe each can only circ 10 times, so really we only get 60 circs out of it. If the ebook is popular and the item keeps getting reserves on it, then we have to keep buying licenses.</p>
<p>Now our regular paper books, which we buy at a price just higher than retail (often reinforced bindings) can circ 20 or more times before they fall apart, so the license model means we pay significantly more per circ.</p>
<p>For us, as a library, and ebook, audiobook, or any other electronic item ISN'T any different that a paper book. We catalog and track them in exactly the same way. Not because it's easier or anything, but because book/item circulation is the most important metric we use in both funding and budget planning. When you do several million circs per year it's nescessary info.</p>
<p>If you're interested in the effect e-publishers have had on public libraries I wrote a post in r/books a couple months ago <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lj0ej2/publishers_need_to_know_that_if_readers_have_to/gnav1o4/?context=3" target="_blank">related to ebooks</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Libraries own books, so they can do what they'd like with them. They have a certain number of books, so they only lend that many. eBooks are similar, because they have acquired a certain number of licenses for eBooks. They only &quot;have&quot; that number, so they're only allowed to lend that many. </p>
<p>They keep track of those eBooks the same way they keep track of books: with digital tools. That's why you can't just download a pdf of a book, you need to use their special tools that limit your access time. That way they can keep the number of people who currently have access to the books limited to the number of licenses they hold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Libraries have to pay distribution licensing fees to let books out, just like Netflix pays to license movies.</p>
<p>With printed books, the license says something like &quot;Library has permission to let out 6 copies of Book for a period of Time, for the price of Dollars.&quot;</p>
<p>Ebooks aren't printed, but the license works the same way. The publisher still sets a limit on distribution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
