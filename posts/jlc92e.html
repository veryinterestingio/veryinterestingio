		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people are making some decently rational arguments about consent, but those are fundamentally nothing more than rationalizations of an irrational system and do not actually answer your question. </p>
<p>It is only unacceptable because our culture has deemed it so. The reasons for this vary, but will all boil down to control and shame. Both which suck. </p>
<p>It’s important to note that this isn’t universal. Here in Germany it is pretty common for people to swim and sunbath nude, in swimsuits, or underwear. Nudity and the human body are not considered sexual 100% of the time. Thus “unacceptable” means something very different depending on culture and context. </p>
<p>If you want to know how we got here though, well that is a pretty long history lesson of cultural modesty standards. It’s all unnecessary and fucked up though, so feel free to disregard them and do what makes you comfortable. Don’t feel pressured to be wear to many or to few clothes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>TL:DR - humans are hard wired to conform to social expectations- even bizarre ones that make no logical sense.</strong></p>
<p>It’s about context and learned social acceptability, not about confidence or body image:</p>
<p>We learn through experience and normative conformity that different kinds of attire are acceptable in different social situations.</p>
<p>We learn that the only situations in which our underwear is on display to other people are limited to communal changing rooms and intimacy in the bedroom.</p>
<p>We learn that there are limited situations to wear a ball gown, a hockey goalkeeping kit, scuba diving gear...</p>
<p>When we see people in certain clothes we make assumptions directly related to what they are wearing: a guy in a tux is travelling to or from a formal event. A girl in her underwear is stripping off or getting dressed.</p>
<p>We don’t <em>know</em> where the guy in the tux Is going - our brains just jump to that conclusion. We don’t walk around wearing only our underwear because we know people will Unconsciously make conclusions.</p>
<p>The situational context is what matters. Take, for example, going topless at the beach. Some societies see this as normal but would be mortified if you stand up and walk 20 yards inland. And nobody does it. Why not? It’s not because of fear of arrest for indecency; it’s for a far more compelling reason: humans are hard wired to conform to social expectations- even bizarre ones that make no logical sense.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I suppose it depends where you live. I have seen women in Poland strip to their bra on the beach or pier to catch some sun. And as far as I could see, they weren't daring young women flouting convention, they were staid-looking women between about 40 and 60, regular mothers and grandmothers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s not about men and women. Not sure why you would make this statement without thinking this out. Why make it just about women?</p>
<p>A guy can wear trunks or a speedo, but boxer briefs or whitey tighties would be just inappropriate as a woman wearing underwear to the beach. It’s cuz underwear is not designed to be outer wear. It just has a different emotion tied to it. Just like wearing pajamas in public is odd. You don’t see people at the grocery story in bathrobes and nighties.</p>
<p>Also, underwear is much thinner and not made for water. It would sag, come off, be see through etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s because a bikini is beach wear. It’s a garment designed for wearing outside. </p>
<p>Think of it like this. You can wear your pyjamas outside (it covers up your body the same way that regular clothes do), but people usually don’t, because you’re not considered dressed if you wear pyjamas.</p>
<p>The same logic applies to wearing underwear on the beach. Women <em>can</em> but usually don’t because those garments are not considered outside clothing. </p>
<p>Also you can’t swim in most underwear, it gets wet, becomes see through, and doesn’t hold water well. This is not an issue with a bikini.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
