		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The salt concentration in blood plasma is ~0.9%.  Thus, &quot;normal&quot; saline solution used for IV fluids administration is also 0.9%. Drinking any water with a higher salt concentration than that will lead to an osmotic imbalance. Now, when you're  talking about drinking water in a survival situation, you always hear that drinking seawater will kill you, but in fact a small amount of seawater can be used to extend your available water supply, provided it is diluted (or rather, that on average, salt intake is reduced) below the 0.9% normal equivalent. Thus, for every part seawater you ingest, you must also ingest a minimum of three equal parts of fresh water (3.5%/4 = 0.875%) for that to be a viable survival tactic.</p>
<p>Edit:  It has been pointed out to me that my description of the physiology of salt elimination in the body is inaccurate. There are many posts in this thread by medical subject matter experts with more accurate descriptions of both the physiological processes at work in the elimination of salts, and the quantitative information regarding tolerable ingestible concentrations and typical blood chemistry. Nevertheless, I stand by the practical survival advice of 1:3, 1:4, or better integer ratio of seawater to fresh water for extending a fresh water supply in a survival scenario.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason that sea water is a problem is that its sodium chloride concentrations are at, or just above, the maximum concentrating ability of the human kidney, so in order to remove salt that is in excess of your body's needs, it must excrete an equal (or slightly greater) amount of water than the salt was in.</p>
<p>At night when human antidiuretic hormone secretion is at its diurnal peak, we produce urine with an osmolarity of \~1,200 mOsm/L (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2709207/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2709207/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2709207/</a></a>). The body does this in order to minimize the amount of urine you make so that you don't have to get up more often to go pee in the middle of the night and can get better rest. It's helpful because while we're sleeping we're not taking in additional fluid, so minimizing the amount of free water that we eliminate while we're not drinking any more maintains homeostasis.</p>
<p>Sea water is more or less the same as 3% sodium chloride that is used to treat symptomatic hyponatremia, so I'll just use that as an example. The osmolarity of 3% saline solution is \~1,000 mOsm/L.</p>
<p>So let's imagine that you are in a situation where you only have sea water to drink and you're thirsty. The thirst suggests that your body serum osmolarity has risen to \~290 mOsm/L (normal is \~280 mOsm/L), which is usually due to enough free water loss (by sweat, diarrhea, voiding, whatever) to raise your serum sodium by 5 points.</p>
<p>Because you're thirsty and surrounded by sea water you drink 1,200 mL of 3% saline. This solution is very hypertonic to your plasma, which would normally be fine as your kidneys could just excrete the salt and hang on to the water, but because it's *so* concentrated, your kidneys will need to get rid of 1,000 mL of of the 1,200 that you drank in order to get rid of the 1,000 mOsm of NaCl (per the maximum concentrating ability cited above).</p>
<p>That only covers the salt handling portion of the mental exercise. The kidneys still have to handle excreting quite a lot of other waste products that have osmolar effects and make it so that you don't actually net out +200 mL of H2O from drinking 1,200 mL of 3% saline.</p>
<p>tl;dr: Sea water will eventually dehydrate you because its sodium chloride concentration is higher than the kidney's maximal concentrating ability that can be sustained for long periods of time. Plasma sodium only matters in that as you become dehydrated it will rise, and your kidneys won't be able to lower it using sea water because they're just not good enough.</p>
