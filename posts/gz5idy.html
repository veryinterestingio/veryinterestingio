<p>The real answer is that shapes with sharp corners are structurally weak.  Arcs and circles are very strong shapes.  If port holes were squares, the openings would get damaged and worn out sooner.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the same reason that airplanes have round(ish) windows. The structure of a ship is put through a lot of changing stresses, both in the sense of the ship being heaved and twisted by waves, and in some cases having actual water pressing against the portholes. The corners or square windows are a point where stresses can build up - it's a weak point. Circles or circular shapes are better at distributing forces equally.</p>
<p>The same is true in airplanes, though there the pressure is from the inside, as the outside pressure drops. Early jets had square windows, and it caused several accidents as the uneven stresses over many many flights led to metal fatigue and finally failure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Round windows are less prone to cracking compared to square ones. The angles of square windows are the weak points, whereas the force is spread amongst the outside of a circle evenly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The De Havilland Comet was the worlds first commercial jet airliner, designed in the late 40's and going into full operation in 1952.</p>
<p>There were a catalogue of issues with the Comet, partly because of the company rushing to beat US competition to the 'jet liner' market, mostly driven by the UK aerospace industry being congested with several major wartime producers scrambling for market share in the new post-war landscape meaning there was a lack of cooperation and De Havilland refused to use the more powerful and advanced jet engines available on the market (made by Rolls Royce), so the plane was underpowered and the airframe was stripped back to the absolute minimum to reduce weight, including going as far as not painting the plane, because of the weight of the paint.</p>
<p>The Comet went into full operation and for a time (a short time) it was seen as a success, partly because of its high-tech design, silver/chrome appearance (because of it having no paint) and because of lots of marketing with big 50's celebrities using them to fly between the US and Europe.</p>
<p>Within the first 12 months of operation 3 Comets were lost to in-flight breakups, and it was because the plane had square windows, the combination of the light airframe (because of the weak engine power) and the structural weak points in the corners of the square windows resulted in mid-air explosions.</p>
<p>De Havilland would flounder about until 1958 when it'd relaunch the Comet, but by then Boeing had released the 747 which was better and more efficient than the Comet and De Havilland would be absorbed by Hawker in 1960 (the people who made the British Hawker Hurricane in WW2) as a part of wider consolidation of the British aerospace, Hawker would go on to form BAE in the 70's.</p>
<p>So long story short, same reason - square windows don't deal with structural stress very well and both ships and aeroplanes suffer cyclic stresses which overtime will cause hairline fractures which will develop into catastrophic failures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
