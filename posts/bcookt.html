		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the common forms of colorblindness (<em>protanopia</em> and <em>deuteranopia</em>) don't really reduce the range of visible wavelengths (at least, not significantly), they just reduce the discriminability of wavelength patterns. the 'missing' cone pigments (so-called Long and Medium pigments for protanopia/deuteranopia, respectively) are so similar that they mostly overlap in their spectral sensitivities.</p>
<p>a protanope might report more difficulty seeing pure very-long-wavelength light, like a red LED or laser light. but they should be able to see it if it's strong enough.</p>
<p>a rare form of colorblindness is <em>tritanopia</em> (lack of short-wavelength pigment), in that case short-wavelength light will be relatively invisible, so the visible spectrum really is significantly reduced (the short-Î» pigment covers a really different range to the L/R pigments). but tritanopia is not what we typically refer to when we say 'colorblind'.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The normal human eye is very good at picking out slight distinctions between spectral red, green, yellow, and orange.  It does this despite the red and green cone cells having a spectral sensitivity peak very close to each other;  These two pieces of wetware are very different from blue cone cells or from the nearly-unrelated rod cells (motion/darkness tuned), but very similar to one another.   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell#/media/File:Cones_SMJ2_E.svg" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone\_cell#/media/File:Cones\_SMJ2\_E.svg" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone\_cell#/media/File:Cones\_SMJ2\_E.svg</a></a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There is a tiny spectral range in between, where the red and green cells are getting equal signal, that we term 'yellow'.  We don't see in spectral colors or in primary colors, we see in ratios of signals perceived in the three different types of cones, based on how the available combination of spectral light excites them.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Around 1% of males lack red cells entirely.  Another 1% of males lack green cells entirely.  In another 1% of males, the red cells have a spectral response that's shifted left a bit so that they're indistinguishable or poorly distinguishable from the green cells.  Lastly, in about 6% of males and 0.4% of females, the green cells have a spectral response that's shifted right a bit so that they're indistinguishable or poorly distinguishable from the red cells.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Because green and red cells are so similar to one another and there's some degree of redundancy in the blue channel, for the most part these don't cause great handicaps;  At worst, deep red colors can get cut off in protanopia and protanomaly, causing colors near the longer-wavelength end of \~400nm to \~700nm human perception to be barely perceptible;  These people genuinely see a little less of the color spectrum than we do.  Show one of these people a 697nm LED or laser, and indeed they won't see anything.  Fortunately for us, these are not common spectral colors in 'red' lasers/LEDs;  Mostly they're much further down, at 635nm or so, where the green cells are perfectly capable of picking up enough light to see.   <a href="https://www.arrow.com/en/research-and-events/videos/led-colors-by-wavelength" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.arrow.com/en/research-and-events/videos/led-colors-by-wavelength" target="_blank">https://www.arrow.com/en/research-and-events/videos/led-colors-by-wavelength</a></a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Show a non-colorblind person a 900nm laser and they're not going to pick up much light;  We actually consider these very dangerous, because you can be staring straight at it without reflexive blinking while it burns away your retina.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Colorblindness is sex-linked because our genes code for red-green color vision in two positions on the sex-determining X chromosomes.  Women have far fewer issues because of the redundancy in their XX chromosome (four positions) that had contributions from each parent; Not only do they have a backup in case one gene gets messed up, if they get one of the variant-peak rather than cone-absence genes, they can even get a (rare) fourth or (vanishingly rare with two different-peak copies) fifth color channel.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Blue color vision is coded for on another chromosome entirely, unlinked to sex.  Variants are extremely rare.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There are also things associated with total lack of color vision;  While this is usually associated with some type of brain damage or abnormality that interferes with perception, a number of genes can interfere with cone cell formation entirely, leaving the eye with just light-hypersensitive, single-channel, broad-spectral-response rod cells to work with.</p>
