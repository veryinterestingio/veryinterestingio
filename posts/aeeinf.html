		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The problem with your question is that it's hard to explain such a large concept in layman's terms... Beyond that, DRM is so large that anything anyone says can likely have someone reply to it with &quot;you are wrong&quot; as they provide some edge case...</p>
<p>DRM or Digital Rights Management is a term used to cover technology and software that attempts to prevent piracy and the sharing of copyrighted materials. An example of DRM is with a lot of computer games that came out between 1990 and 2012 is that you would buy them and they would contain a key (a series of letters and numbers) that you would be prompted for on installation... This meant that if you say bought a copied disk of the game that you couldn't install the game without the key (except that a key could either be shared and a lot of games reused the key so if one person posted it online it was available to everyone). Another type of DRM within the playstation 1 was that they used specific specialty disks that would basically wobble and this wobble was used to determine whether it was an authentic disk or not, however there are multiple ways to bypass this from installing a modchip (difficult) to actually starting the load process with one disk and quickly swapping disks after it does its security check.</p>
<p>So how does DRM work? Depends on the implementation, there are dozens to hundreds of examples of DRM because it's such a broad thing, and this is why if I say something like &quot;DRM works by checking the authenticity of the files&quot; could be replied with &quot;you are wrong&quot; as some DRM implementations don't check for authenticity... Some will allow for a limited number of installations (like iTunes, at least how iTunes used to) where you can only have say 5 devices connected to a single account and each device has to pair with the server before it can be considered connected...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there DRM removal software...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>... That works for all services</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, uhm no... Because not all services are the same...</p>
<p>The easiest way I can say it is that every medium to large company (this includes things like supercell) that produces digital media probably has developed their own DRM implementation, and not all of those implementations are publically available.. Some of their implementations may be server side... So it's very difficult to truly develop a workaround for many of them... Also not all DRM is purely digital, some is mechanical.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All of the other answers are generally correct and very informative, but I want to describe an edge case that demonstrates how problematic DRM methods can be to work around.</p>
<p>The Nintendo GameCube implemented a physical (rather than digital) form of DRM to prevent copying of game discs. Almost all optical disc drives read discs starting at the inside ring and moving outward to the edge. Nintendo designed the GameCube to read discs the opposite way - from the outside edge to the inside hole. This meant that you couldn't put a GC game in a computer disc drive and read the contents, because the computer couldn't recognize the file structure on the disc.</p>
<p>Eventually some people were able to hack the GC and connect it to a computer so that they could use the GC to read out the files on the disc - but this still leaves you with a problem. If you take your copied files and burn them onto a normal optical disc using a normal disc burner, it won't work on a GameCube because the GameCube reads discs outside-in but your copy is a standard inside-out disc.</p>
<p>At one point there was a kit to replace the entire top of a GameCube with a standard optical disc reader in order to easily play illegally copied games, but unless you were really good with electronics you had decent odds of wrecking your GameCube in the process.</p>
<p>It's worth pointing out that this is an example of good DRM. It protects the content but does not affect the normal use of the product. There's no encryption, no nasty spying software (e.g. Sony rootkits), no required always-on internet connection, and not even the inconvenience of having to enter a key code.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>DRM is a generic term for any system designed to prevent you from using media without purchasing it.  There are many forms it can take and each works completely differently from every other.  There's a huge variety and it would be impossible to explain it all.   </p>
<p>But this does mean that the answer to question 2 is no.  They different methods are so different that it is impossible for a single solution to address all of them.  Some of them aren't even wholely software.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>DRM is a lock. It needs the key to unlock what's inside.<br />
That's it! That's all DRM is. A lock.</p>
<p>You say &quot;Great. I have a Skeleton Key that opens any lock it's in.&quot; That's one of your programs. </p>
<p>That's awesome! Except... </p>
<p>It only fits one kind of lock. It doesn't fit those little padlocks, or bike locks with that tube kind of key. It definitely doesn't help those military ones that need two keys turned at the same time. </p>
<p>And then what about combination locks that don't use a key at all? And those new car keys with a microchip in them? Fingerprint locks? Retina scan locks?</p>
<p>Or maybe it's the McDonald's bathroom lock, where someone in another room has to see you on a camera first and then buzz you in. </p>
<p>Every one of those needs a different way to get past the different kinds of lock. </p>
<p>And DRM is inventing new styles of locks <em>every single week</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If software is a door, DRM is the lock. It only lets those who have a key (customers) in, and keeps everyone else out. However almost any lock can be picked (cracked) with time, effort, and skill. To combat lock pickers, companies will make new locks with mechanisms that no one knows how to bypass yet. Lock complexity can be increased for added security but it can cause problems. A door with a hundred locks will keep anyone without the keys away, but can be a rather unpleasant experience even for key holders. (DRM can negatively impact the software it's used in by impacting performance or reducing compatibility.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
