		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not much. Space is mostly empty and with the distances between stars being as big as they are, the chances of an actual collision or short-range interaction between an Andromeda star and a Milky Way star are extremely small.</p>
<p>The gravitational interactions of the merger could result in some stars being flung into a different orbit around the core or even being ejected from the galaxy. But such processes take a very long time and aren't nearly as dramatic as the description implies.</p>
<p>The super massive black holes at the center of both galaxies will approach each other, orbit each other and eventually merge. This merger is likely to produce some highly energetic events that could significantly alter the position or orbit of some stars. Stars in the vicinity of the merging black holes may be swallowed up or torn apart. But again, this is a process taking place over the course of millions of years, so not a quick flash in the pan.</p>
<p>As for Earth? By the time the merger is expected to happen, some 4.5 billion years from now, which is around the time that the Sun is at the end of the current stage of its life and at the start of the red giant phase. The Earth may or may not have been swallowed up by the Sun as it expanded to become a red giant, but either way, Earth would've turned into a very barren and dead planet quite a while before that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To put things in perspective, instead of galaxies let's imagine crowds of people. We've got two massive crowds of hundreds of billions of people running toward each other really fast, and you're one of those people. With that many people it seems inevitable that you're going to hit someone else, right? Well these crowds are really spread out. Like, REALLY spread out. In fact the closest person to you in your crowd is around 750,000 miles away. That's 3 times farther away than the moon!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the Milky Way galaxy will do just about the same to Andromeda, as it's been found that they are comparable in size... Andromeda is NOT twice the size as we once thought (at least with the latest evidence).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.space.com/39751-andromeda-galaxy-not-bigger-than-milky-way.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.space.com/39751-andromeda-galaxy-not-bigger-than-milky-way.html" target="_blank">https://www.space.com/39751-andromeda-galaxy-not-bigger-than-milky-way.html</a></a></p>
<p>Most likely it'll be a mashy mess for many millions of years before it all conglomerates into a giant elliptical galaxy.</p>
<p>And yes, Earth will almost certainly survive... if fact, our entire solar system will likely not even notice the transition (with the possibility that we get through out of the new galaxy altogether).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our Sun is increasing it's output (very slowly, on the order of 1% per 100 million years). But this means when Andromeda encounters the Milky Way, in about 4.5 billion years, our Sun will be about 40-45% more energentic than it is now. Our oceans will have boiled away, life as we know it will be exterminated, and Earth will look more like Mercury than what we know now.</p>
<p>If we, as a species, aren't off the planet and living on new worlds, the encounter with Andromeda won't matter at all.</p>
<p>Regardless, shortly (heh, astronomically speaking) afterwards, about another billion years, our Sun will balloon into a red giant and completely consume the Earth, so we'd damn well better be gone by then.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
