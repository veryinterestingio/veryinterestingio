		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Exercise gets your heart beating rapidly temporarily, which along with other health benefits die to exercise means the heart can beat slower and with less effort when you are not exercising which is most of the time.</p>
<p>Chronic stress has been linked to increases in things like cholesterol, and blood pressure which is not good for your heart at all. Your heart is working harder for a long time, not just temporarily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Exercise releases dopamine, which is happy juice for our brains and bodies. It makes us feel calm, content, and positive. Your heart is beating faster because it's happily working and getting stronger. And it makes our bodies sleep better and crave healthy foods, too, and those things help release dopamine, so it's a good way to create a cycle of feeling good.</p>
<p>Stress releases cortisol, which is scary juice for our brains and bodies. It makes us feel really alarmed really quickly so we'll save ourselves from danger by running, hiding, or fighting. In short bursts, it's really useful. But if we have scary juice racing through our bodies all the time, that's bad. It causes inflammation, which makes us sick and cause disease. It makes our brains think we have to stay alert, so we can't sleep. It makes our bodies want the fastest hit of energy it can get, which is food really high in fat and sugar.  Even one night of bad sleep depletes our immune systems by up to 50%, so we get sick more often. Diets high in fat and sugar create other bad body chemicals that make us feel anxious or uncomfortable. So, stress that isn't addressed in a healthy way (ironically, exercising and eating well and getting good sleep) is a good way to create a cycle of feeling really bad.</p>
<p>Sorry...I tried to pretend I was actually explaining this to a 5 year old, but I should have gone to sleep over an hour ago so my creativity is low. But that's the gist of it as I understand it.</p>
<p>Edit: basically, why your heart rate increases depends on what your brain believes. If your brain believes you're doing something to get stronger, it releases dopamine. If your brain believes you're in danger, it releases cortisol. Cortisol is good...if you're a caveman running from a bear, or a mother lifting a rolled car to get her child out. Prolonged cortisol is bad - it's a heightened state of alarm as a set point. You can't run from a bear forever and ever or hold that car aloft indefinitely. That's just not what cortisol was designed for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Where’s it flowing all the extra blood to so quickly? Rest of the body isn’t moving and doesn’t need that type of action.
Imagine if you were a big cyclist and randomly your right leg pedals around while you’re reading in a chair. It’s unnatural and a sign that something is wrong.
My cars engine goes to 4000 RPM when i get on the highway, but if it goes to 4000 RPM when I’m at a stoplight then there’s a problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Elevated heart rate when excersizing is a by-product of increased physical excersion. How high it rises greatly depends on ones current physical condition; breathing, technique and form. This is typically a concious, deliberate process. The heart needs to send blood and oxygen around the body faster to sustain increased physical activity. </p>
<p>Panic/Stress/Anxiety are usually involuntary and uncontrolled. Theres a lot more going on and elevated heart rate would be more complex. </p>
<p>Getting heart rate up to burn calories or physical activity= good, deliberate and controlled. </p>
<p>High heart rate from stress/panic/anxiety= uncontrolled or brought on with no warning. Often MUCH higher rates then what someone getting in to shape would expierence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe another component of this is the rapid increase in blood pressure and other adverse effects from your heart rate being “out of sync” with the rest of the body. When you exercise, your blood vessels dilate, so as your heart rate increases the blood can get around faster. When you suddenly have a panic attack, the rest of your body isn’t physiologically in “exercise mode” which can cause your breathing and blood pressure to be out of line with a racing heart. Suddenly you are light headed and have tightness in your chest. </p>
<p>I went on beta-blockers for anxiety attacks and they prevented my heart rate from increasing due to anxiety, but also sometimes prevented natural increases due to increased activities. So a slightly fast walk was the max I could do sometimes because my heart rate was in cruise control.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
