		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Someone gave a good response that quoted from Wikipedia, but I'd like to share how Avogadro's constant (N_0) came about.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Avogadro coined this idea in 1811, when he first proposed that the volume of a gas is somehow proportional to the number of atoms/molecules in the gas.</p>
<p>Jean Perrin defined it as the number of atoms in 32 grams of oxygen in 1909, because the contemporaries of the era wanted to make the <em>mass of a mole of X</em> be numerically equal to the mass of X, relative to the mass of a hydrogen atom. Jean Perrin used several methods to calculate this number, but he wasn't the first person to explore this idea.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If we look further back, we find that Loschmidt was the first scientist to measure this number in 1865, albeit indirectly. Loschmidt's constant (henceforth referred to as <em>n</em>) is the number of particles in a mole of an ideal gas. This is related to Avogadro's constant by the ideal gas law, by <em>n</em> = p*N_0/(RT).</p>
<p>Loschmidt deduced his constant from Maxwell's definition of the mean free path (i.e. the average distance between two molecules), which he manipulated into producing an elegant relationship: d = 8*l*V_liquid/V_gas, where d is the effective diameter of a molecule, l is the mean free path, and V_liquid/V_gas is the ratio between the volume of a mole of gas after it has been condensed, and before it has been condensed. Loschmidt initially came up with a crude estimate, but this was quickly refined by Maxwell in 1873, and as we know, Jean Perrin calculated the number we now know as Avogadro's constant in 1909.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Robert Millikan later refined this through Faraday's work on electrolysis, where Faraday defines Faraday's constant as the total charge in a mole of electrons. Faraday's constant is used in Faraday's law, which states that the mass (m) of material electroplated is equal to the total electric charge (Q) multiplied by the molar mass of the material (M), divided by the product of the ionic charge of the ion (z) responsible and Faraday's constant. In other words, m = QM/Fz.</p>
<p>Faraday electroplated silver using a constant current, so this quickly rearranges to m/M = It/Fz. Since the molar mass and the ionic charge of silver is known, and the current and time taken is controlled by Faraday, we can quickly determine Faraday's constant.</p>
<p>Millikan measured the charge of a single electron in 1910 through his Nobel Prize-winning oil drop experiment, where he suspended a precisely weighed drop of oil between two charged plates by balancing the force of gravity and electrostatic repulsion on the droplet of oil. By doing so, he was also able to determine Avogadro's constant to an astounding accuracy.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As far as I know, there were few improvements to this method until the International Bureau of Weights and Measures decided to redefine it as the number of atoms in a mole of carbon-12 in 1971. By defining Avogadro's constant as such, we effectively declare that the mass of a mole of carbon-12 is precisely equivalent to the number of atoms in carbon-12, but this does not necessarily hold true for other elements.</p>
<p>In 2017, the IBPM tweaked the definition of a mole to be &quot;the amount of substance containing exactly 6.02214076Ã—10\^23 elementary entities&quot;. This subtle change meant that the mass of a mole of carbon-12 atoms is no longer exactly 12 grams, but this also put an end to the constant quest of a precise measurement of the number of molecules in a mole of <em>X.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is not the original method of course, but we just did a chemistry experiment to estimate it (with some tail-wagging dog) that actually worked relatively well in my case:</p>
<p>Essentially Avo's number is a ratio of discrete individual 'bits' to a set amount of bits, a mole. What those bits are can vary, but the ratio, which is Avo's number, allows for some easy computing down the road--for instance the interchangeability of AMU's and grams/mole for atomic masses. </p>
<p>Our experiment harnessed the hydrophobic/hydrophilic nature of the fatty acids that compose our cellular membranes: We standardized a stearic acid solution and laid it as a lipid monolayer on an aqueous surface of known diameter. We then used VSEPR to estimate the volume displaced by individual stearic acid molecules and their length. Then, I calculated the surface area of our aqueous surface and dropped height. I then related surface area and surface area/molecule for a total number of molecules forming the monolayer (big number). </p>
<p>Returning to our standardized stearic acid solution, we standardize so we can estimate how many moles of stearic acid we used in forming the monolayer. Relate moles to number of molecules, and you end up with Avogadro's number. My own replication yielded 4e23 or some such, I believe it was 20% error or some such.</p>
<p>Anyhow, that experiment was a bit circular in my opinion because we used molar mass in our initial standardization of stearic acid, which requires Avo's number to work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With the advent of graphene, would it be conceivably possible to measure out 1 gram of graphene, and using basic width * height measurements of the graphene sheets, to extrapolate the exact number of atoms in a gram?</p>
<p>I guess the biggest problem would be measuring one gram precisely enough to know we've added one, or one trillion too many or few atoms to be a gram.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
