		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Having negative Kelvin temperatures is a consequence of the technical definition of temperature. Intuitively, we tend to think of temperature as how much energy the average particle has in the thing you're looking at. However, this isn't quite right. The definition used in technical contexts is how much more disordered the thing you're looking at gets when you add energy. </p>
<p>Case 1: If by adding energy to the system,  particles move around more and more,  then that's the usual positive Kelvin temperatures. Basically, it get more disordered as you add energy. </p>
<p>Case 2: If by adding energy to the system, the particles move less or are behaving more uniformly, then this corresponds to negative Kelvin temperatures. </p>
<p>It's a statement about disorder (or entropy) as you increase or decrease the energy in the system. Most things in the world behave like case 1, which is why 99% of the time it's fine to think of temperature as the average energy of particles in the system. However, there are some exotic systems which can have negative Kelvin instead.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, yeah, the theory is weird but it's possible to have temperatures that are less than absolute zero (i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_temperature" target="_blank">negative on the Kelvin scale</a>).  Those temperatures, it turns out, are actually hotter than anything with a positive temperature.  As an analogy, think of the amount of heat in a system as the speed a car is going but the temperature as the reading on the speedometer.  As the car speeds up, the number on the speedometer increases until you hit the highest value that the speedometer can go -- after that, the numbers on the speedometer don't make sense to us, anymore.  We say that the speedometer shows the speed of the car but that's a simplification -- one that works in the normal range of things.  Similarly, we think of temperature as how much energy something has to impart to something else but that, too, is a simplification -- the actual definition of temperature is more complex.  The actual definition is easier to explain like this:  adding energy to a positive temperature system increases the system's randomness (or, entropy) but adding energy to a negative temperature system decreases the system's entropy.</p>
<p>Let's look at just one of the ways a system can store energy: electron spin.  A normal hydrogen atom has one electron.  In a group of normal hydrogen atoms, all the electrons have the same energy and all of the electrons are spinning (this is a simplified description).  If you put that hydrogen in a magnetic field, though, most of the atoms will move so that their electrons are spinning &quot;with the field&quot; and have lower energy than a few that don't move and stay spinning &quot;against the field&quot;.  Think of this like the atoms are little magnets -- when you bring a bigger magnet near all those little magnets, most of the little magnets align with the big magnet but a few of them will line up exactly opposite the big magnet.  It turns out that we can flip the atoms by adding energy to the system using radio frequency techniques.  Since the system has maximum entropy when half of the electrons are aligned with the field and half are against the field, flipping the &quot;with the field&quot; atoms to be &quot;against the field&quot; adds energy and decreases entropy -- at least for our initial system where most of the atoms are with the field.  After the point where we've hit the 50/50 mixture, though, adding energy decreases entropy.  This corresponds to a negative temperature for the electron spin.  </p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/01/130104143516.htm" target="_blank">Science Daily</a>, &quot;Physicists at the Ludwig-Maximilians University Munich and the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Garching have now created an atomic gas in the laboratory that [...] has negative Kelvin values&quot;.  They've managed to create a system where adding energy to the system decreases the randomness of the system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This is true, &quot;A system with a truly negative temperature on the Kelvin scale is <em>hotter</em> than any system with a positive temperature.&quot; So you aren't going &quot;down&quot;, you are going &quot;up&quot; to get Negative Kelvins.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm no expert, but it sounds to me like what is happening is:</p>
<p>- We found some Quantum Mechanical systems where there is a &quot;maximum&quot; amount of energy that the system can have. (This isn't possible without QM. Normally,  adding energy  just makes everything vibrate/move faster, causing it to be more and more disordered, causing the Entropy and Temperature to go up.)</p>
<p>- In this QM system, adding energy works like normal at first (below 50%). As you add energy, your particles move around more, and your Temperature goes up.</p>
<p>- Until you get to 50% of the maximum energy in the system: At this point, the system is at maximum Entropy, so it's at it's highest Temperature (most disordered) it will ever achieve. This is infinite temperature on our graph because you can't get any hotter.</p>
<p>- Adding a little bit more energy pushes you above 50%. The system starts to have &quot;less&quot; wiggle room (states for the particles to move in to.) The temperature transitions from positive infinity to negative infinity.</p>
<p>- Adding energy (over 50%) now reduces the number of different states.  The &quot;temperature&quot; is increasing, so classically we would say it's &quot;getting hotter&quot;. But it's increasing from negative infinity. In reality it's getting &quot;colder&quot; because  Entropy is decreasing. (Many of the particles are at maximum energy and 'stuck' there with nowhere else to go.)</p>
<p>- As it approaches maximum (100%) energy, there are fewer and fewer ways to move left. All the particles are 'stuck' at their highest energy and have nowhere else to go. So the system &quot;looks&quot; like zero Kelvin. But it's actually approaching zero Kelvin from the Negative side. It can never actually get to zero/positive Kelvins: We are at maximum energy, so adding more doesn't work.</p>
<p>- If you want positive Kelvins again, you actually have to remove enough energy to get to the 50% energy point, then you will be back to positive infinity Kelvins.</p>
<p>- From &quot;outside&quot; of the QM system, the &quot;Negative Kelvins&quot; don't matter, they are just energy. So when the &gt;50% QM system comes into contact with 'normal stuff' the energy will move from the QM system and heat up the the 'normal stuff' in the normal way. Since normal stuff doesn't have an energy limit, it can only get hotter, and will never reach Negative Kelvins.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In reality, temperature is the &quot;wrong&quot; variable.  In the past, we have only seen systems where &quot;adding energy&quot; increases Entropy and Temperature, so we assumed they were related. In practice, Temperature is discontinuous, so &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_beta" target="_blank">coldness</a>&quot; (the <em>reciprocal</em> of temperature) is the more fundamental unit. (See the black line in the graph.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a playground full of children.<br />
Gives the children sugary drink and now they are running twice as fast everywhere. This is the basic idea of raising the temperature.<br />
Now give the kids Nyquil. They slow down and get tired and don'
t move as fast. This is lowering the temperature.<br />
Now, notice when they were running fast the were also spreading out chaotically. More Temp equal more movement and Chaos.<br />
Now get the kids to slow down and line up and play the 'Hokey pokey'<br />
They are moving but not spreading out chaotically. This is negative temperature.<br />
If the start doing a big dance routine where they are moving greatly but with tightly controlled steps, this is an even more negative temperature.<br />
The kids being completely still would be absolute zero. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
