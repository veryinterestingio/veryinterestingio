<p>I don't know the exact specifications of a P100 mask, but it's perfectly possible that it is able to filter out &quot;large&quot; objects such as viruses, while allowing smaller objects, such as the regular components of air as well as molecules that trigger a smell to pass through relatively unhindered.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>No it does not. You should know about the types of filtration. There is <em>physical</em> filtration, where particles are blocked, and then there is <em>chemical</em> filtration, where molecules are blocked or are adsorbed onto something / absorbed into something, or reacted with something, and prevented from coming through. Think of it this way: if you mix a bunch of clay into water and stir it up, the water turns opaque. You can run this through fine enough a filter, and all the clay particles (which are tiny flakes) can be filtered out. However, if you dissolve molasses into the water, no amount of <em>physical</em> filtration will get the molasses out. For that, you need a <em>chemical</em> filter.</p>
<p>In contrast, you can chemically filter something, while not really physically filtering it. One example of chemical filtration is activated carbon. If you put water that has a dissolved chemical into a vessel with aquarium carbon (activated carbon), the activated carbon will adsorb (stick things to its massive amount of internal surface area) the molecules of stuff from the molasses and draw it out of the water. But the nuggets of activated carbon won't physically filter your water if it is muddy. You still need physical filtration for that.</p>
<p>Those respirators can be fitted with either P100 physical filters, or the organic vapor filters which have a pack of activated carbon in them to adsorb odors. </p>
<p>Since the kind of threat that will infect you with the virus are droplets and aerosols, physical filtration will suffice. It is not an odor or a molecule that causes COVID-19. </p>
<p><strong>Extra explanation about activated carbon: what is it? And why is it so good at chemical filtration?</strong></p>
<p>Activated carbon can be made of either coal or charcoal. The term &quot;activated&quot; in this sense means that it has been treated to massively increase its porosity and adsorptivity (which some people speak of in terms of &quot;surface area&quot;). (In the case of activated carbon, we use the term &quot;adsorb&quot; with a 'd' rather than &quot;absorb&quot; because adsorption means adhering things to a surface, whereas absorb means to pull something into something else. The distinction may seem a bit arcane, I'm just being technically correct because otherwise an even bigger nerd than me will come by and say &quot;actually...&quot;)</p>
<p>The way charcoal or coal get activated is by being used to carry out <a href="http://www.allpowerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Reduction-Reactions.png" target="_blank">reduction reactions</a>. </p>
<p>CO2 + C --&gt; 2 CO</p>
<p>H2O + C --&gt; H2 + CO</p>
<p>(In this case, &quot;reduction&quot; is the opposite of &quot;oxidation&quot;. We're not using it in the sense of making something less.) When carbon is heated to high temperatures, it develops a strong affinity for oxygen. This affinity is so strong that carbon will pull oxygen right off of carbon dioxide and water vapor, reducing them to carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Charcoal or coal that is to be activated is heated and exposed to super-heated CO2 and/or H2O, and when these molecules collide with the solid carbon, every collision site ends up losing a carbon atom as the carbon at the collision site reacts with the O from CO2 or H2O, coming off as CO (carbon monoxide). The result is that carbon materials that have been exposed to reduction reactions for an extended period of time get nano-perforated from all of these collisions with CO2 or H2O pulling off individual carbon atoms, becoming highly porous at the molecular scale, with lots of sites where chemicals can get caught and can react with open bonds made available through the reduction reactions. This is why activated carbon is such a fantastic chemical filter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
