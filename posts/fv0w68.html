		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most antibiotics work by disrupting bacterial synthesis, whether it keeps them from forming a cell wall, generating proteins, or replicating their DNA, and so it's pretty easy for bacteria to develop resistance to that. But as someone else said, it's hard to develop a resistance to something that completely poisons and obliterates bacterial cell walls and viral capsids, whether or not it's actively dividing. It's like the difference between human skin evolving to be darker pigmented to protect us from the sun's radiation versus developing skin that would protect us from an H-bomb. </p>
<p>Also, we over-sanitized things even before coronavirus. A little extra lysol or hand sanitizer at this point is like a drop in the ocean.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Alcohol kills everything.</p>
<p>It’s a lot easier for antibiotic resistant bacteria to develop, than bacteria that can survive on a surface covered in alcohol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other answers, about how disinfectants and antibiotics differ in their actions upon viruses/bacteria/cells, the current increase in disinfectant use and cleaning measures won't continue long enough for pathogens to become resistant.  Even if the current pandemic lasted for 2-3 years, like historical plagues and flu pandemics, as opposed to the general 18 months they are guesstimating at this point, that's too short of a period of time for the organisms to develop resistance to household products of which a cocktail are used.</p>
<p>Drug resistant strains develop resistance after being exposed to a single, individual antibiotic over and over, for years and years. A sudden mass panic use of a variety of disinfectant products with varying ingredients will only cause a &quot;maybe eventually&quot; scenario if the current high level of usage is prolonged.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>What *I* wanna know is why all of the sudden people have bought out ALL of the cleaning supplies from local grocery stores and big box stores.  What were they doing before this happened, just NOT cleaning their houses?  Makes me concern.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not really.<br />
Sanitizing and Disinfecting isn't like treating with an antibiotic, which is a completely different process that involves our immune systems and causes the drug resistances.<br />
You can sanitize a surface without causing irreparable damage to your body(unless you do it wrong), you can't sanitize your insides without killing yourself in short order.</p>
<p>The bacteria's and viruses were concerned about already have a short life-span and would die off without interaction within a few days.<br />
It's akin to leaving behind and finding fingerprints(just think of how many fingerprints are on you phone right now - those prints are made of mostly body oils from your face and sweating, which of course, contain bacteria). Outside - fingerprints might last a couple of days because of the nature of weather. Inside buildings, without proper cleaning fingerprints can last a long time. But with a proper cleaning schedule, they might be eliminated within hours. </p>
<p>Which is where everyone's saying 'stop the spread', which is fine for rural areas but doesn't actually work in cities because of the sheer number of people and animals.<br />
So the entire point of sanitizing and disinfecting is killing them before it gets into your body. Stopping the next person who interacted with your table, your phone, your desk, the shopping cart. THAT COFFEE CUP YOU LEFT SITTING ON A GROCERY STORE SHELF YOU FILTHY ANIMAL.<br />
Combined with population movement control and proper social distancing, this is usually enough to control most diseases.<br />
It's never been done to this scale before, and some people just simply cannot comprehend hygiene(&quot;because its never been a problem for me before&quot;), or cannot comprehend that their actions effect others(&quot;what do you mean that I hurt you&quot;), and if they do understand that their actions effect others, cannot give one flying f*ck that they have(&quot;suck it up&quot;).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
