		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the term ground is thrown around a lot in electronics but most of the time just refers to the reference point that is 0 volts. for instance, a 9v battery has a hot terminal thats 9v (or should be), and a &quot;ground&quot; terminal thats 0v. if you measure the battery with the leads on a meter backwards (putting the black 'ground' lead on the 9v point) then the ground of the battery will read -9v.</p>
<p>in pc power supplies, theres a -3.3v output, if you measure across the 12v and the -3.3v you would read 15.3v.</p>
<p>the term ground is only really talking about the ground in home wiring. in a power grid you need one reference point for a large geographical area, it so happens that the ground we stand on has a fairly uniform charge and conducts well enough to act as a reference point.</p>
<p>the &quot;ground&quot; on a helicopter is just a point that the electronics will reference as 0v. this is generally the chassis of the vehicle. compared to the actual ground this might be thousands of volts, in which case the heli will just have a discharge when it lands or touches something thats at a different potential.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer that, first I have to go over what it means to &quot;ground&quot; something. So, voltage is intrinsically a comparative measure- as in, voltage is defined as the difference in electric potential between two things. It doesn't make sense to talk about the voltage at one point in a circuit; you have to have something else to compare it to in order to give voltage a meaning. This is where the idea of a ground comes in: if we connect all the points in a circuit that should be a neutral voltage to each other together, we can define all those points as 0 volts and compare all other points in the circuit to the 0 volt rail we just created to get their voltages. </p>
<p>In case that's not as clear a description as I'd like it to be, here's an example: let's say we had a AA battery. The voltage across the terminals on the battery would be perfectly defined, because the terminals are electrically connected by the battery. But the voltage from, say the negative terminal of the battery to the negative terminal of a second battery would not be defined, because they are not electrically connected in any way. There could be a potential difference of thousands of volts between them due to static electricity, or there could be zero volts between them, there just isn't any way of knowing without defining a common voltage between the two batteries with which to compare. You could define this common voltage by simply touching the two batteries' positive terminals together, after which the voltage across the negative terminals would be defined.</p>
<p>So, you need this common ground in order to make voltages across different parts of a circuit make sense. And, because of the effects of static electricity, it's also of practical interest to make the common ground the same for as many different circuits as possible - if your toaster's ground and your blender's ground had a potential difference of thousands of volts due to static electricity, that would be a real safety hazard. So making the actual ground be the ground for all the circuits in your house is just the simplest and most effective way of doing just that, as it also guarantees that every circuit in your neighborhood is grounded to the same potential. </p>
<p>In cars and planes, however, using the actual earth as a ground isn't possible. Instead, they use the next best thing: the frame of the cars and planes themselves. Because they also connect one of the terminals of the main battery to the frame, the frame can be used as a huge wire for circuits to draw power from (this is actually how all of the stuff in your car works). </p>
<p>So, and TL;DR:</p>
<p>The devices in a plane or car can be grounded by simply using the frame of the car or plane as a ground, but the frame of the car or plane is probably not at the same potential as the actual earth - this is why you'll sometimes get a shock from static electricity after you get out of your car.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don't have a 'ground' as such. </p>
<p>Voltage is a measure between two energy levels, 0v is not necessarily the same on every device.</p>
<p>If a sensor sends a 5v signal to a computer, that 5v is only read as 5v if the sensor and computer have a common 0v to compare it to. Not having a 0v tie down is known as a 'floating' voltage.</p>
<p>Most vehicles use the body as the 0v or gnd that all other voltages are referenced from as it reduces wiring due to not needing to run 0v wires to every component.</p>
<p>This is why when having strange electrical issues it is always recommended to check and clean the earth terminals on the body as the reference 0v may be disturbed by the presence of corrosion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just like in a car, the negative terminal of the battery is connected to the frame of an aircraft so that you can establish a return path for any circuit, simply by hooking the return up to the frame.</p>
<p>Any excessive charge an airframe collects while flying is disappeared into the air through static discharge wicks, which are placed on the trailing edges of wings, ailerons, stabilizers, elevators, etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
