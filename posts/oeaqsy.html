		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>rabbits have something called hypsodont teeth that continually grow throughout their lives the things  they chew on wear their teeth out, if the root of the tooth were to fall out they would not regenerate though. this can be a problem for a lot of domesticated animals getting the wrong diet as teeth can overgrow and cause the animal pain when eating and even eventually kill them if we do not intervene. humans have teeth called brachydont teeth that stop growing once they mature therefore they do not keep growing like a lot of the herbivore species</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Theres always an evolutionary reason for these kinds of biological traits. For the vast majority of human existence tooth rot simply wasn't as big of an issue. It's a problem for us now due to increased sugar intake that bacteria thrive on. Rodents evolved to have constantly growing teeth because they gnaw through tough material and wear them down over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of good answers but no one has made the point that our teeth actually last much longer than rabbits’. Decay isn’t a major concern if you’ll be crow food in a few years. </p>
<p>Also, sugary foods cause teeth decay and rabbits don’t eat it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read an /r/askscience thread (that I can't find) a while back focused on why humans can't regrow teeth like sharks. People have covered why rodents have teeth that grow constantly, but I haven't seen a good take on the human end of this. Basically, you develop your second set of teeth before your first set are even in use, and only switch once your entire life. Developing a &quot;tooth assembly line&quot; like sharks have would be a huge evolutionary hurdle, not just on a scale like what would matter to our hunter-gatherer ancestors or other great apes, but something that would be incredibly significant on a scale of 10s to hundreds of millions of years. The issue is that on that time scale there's a good chance that any given evolutionary line needed to be pretty damn good at grinding down leaves for a significant chunk of their total calorie intake. If you're pretty damn dependant on grinding leaves with your teeth, having a tooth or two out of place can have a horrible and potentially fatal effect on the end to end efficiency of your digestive system. Each generation of teeth you grow risks having your teeth so misaligned that you starve, and some intermediate system to having more than 2 generations of teeth would be especially error prone. </p>
<p>Granted, early hominids were not dependant on grinding up grass and leaves to survive, but if your evolutionary line might have needed to depend on that food source more several times in the past 65 million years, it's kinda hard to get a shark-like system up and running.</p>
