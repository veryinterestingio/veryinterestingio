The formulation that I learned in high school (Newton’s law of cooling) assumes that one of the objects stays at a constant temperature. Assuming that these two bodies are completely isolated, is there a formulation that gives change in temperature as a function of time for two bodies whose temperatures are non static?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I understand your question correctly, it isn't a more general law of cooling but rather there'd need to be a set of equations or relationship of energy transferred to temperature rise and fall of the two bodies. The most general form would very likely involve differential equations. </p>
<p>The problem with differential equations is that they don't always (in fact they mostly don't) have a closed form &quot;solution&quot; mathematically. The most common way to get an answer would be to use a numerical/computational method - essentially finding an approximate solution by taking very small time slices and making a simplifying assumption between each time slice to determine what happens from one moment to the next. (ie this doesn't work manually - huge amount of computation)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but it's not a nice function. Instead of describing T as a function of time, we can describe how fast T is changing based on the current temperatures:</p>
<p>dT1/dt=k(T2-T1)/C1
dT2/dt=k(T1-T2)/C2</p>
<p>What this says is that the rate of change of temp of body 1 is proportional to how much hotter body two is, while the rate of change of temo of body 2 is proportional to how much hotter body 1 is.</p>
<p>As other posters have explained in order to actually get temperature as a function of time you need to then solve these differential equations. Which can be difficult.</p>
<p>Note that textbooks probably wouldn't present it exactly like this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people look at a problem like this, see differential equations, understand that somewhere back in their math education there's a way to unpack a lot of differential equations to solve for T(x,y), and when nothing comes to mind because they've forgotten those classes, resort to numerical simulations.  Five minutes with an Excel spreadsheet later, they have a good approximation of the answer.</p>
<p>To design that simulation, you would require the initial temperature of both objects (in kelvins by preference), their mass, and the specific heat of their materials.</p>
<p>In the real world, a lot of materials complicate this simple simulation.  Specific heat may vary slightly with temperature.  All or some subset of the materials used to construct the objects may undergo endothermic/exothermic phase transitions.  Anything that can adsorb moisture, ends up with properties extremely reliant on the current moisture level, and any changes that may occur in it.  Solvents undergo thermodynamic transitions with the level of dissolved solids.  Solids undergo thermodynamic transitions with changing crystal structure.  There's probably more I'm not aware of.  All this gets you is an approximate solution, for simple materials.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The general heat <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation" target="_blank">equation</a> might be an answer to what you’re asking. It is to heat transport as what the navier stoke’s equation is for momentum transport. Mathematically, it is extremely similar, you can use a shell balance and Fourier’s law of conduction to derive it, and use Newton’s law of cooling as boundary conditions to describe the convection. Similarity in momentum transport you would use a shell balance and the Cauchy stress tensor to describe fluid flow. Generally differential equations become unsolvable though, so we have to make approximations or nondimensionalize the equation to get constants that can give us physical insight into the different systems.</p>
<p>Edit:
If you’re getting any answer that’s not this equation or isn’t a differential equation people are trying to dive into specific systems without a full explanation. There’s also one guy who just gave the definition of heat capacity and I’m not sure why, I’m pretty sure he conflated heat transport and thermodynamics.</p>
<p>Also, if you want to get even more general it’s useful to recognize that it is assumed that the any material this is going through is incompressible. If you don’t assume that you can modify the equation, but that will largely come in the form of changing the navier stoke’s equations to solve for a different velocity profile on the side of the material derivative.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
