		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The 60s space program was an all out effort spurred in large part by Cold War thinking. It had the backing of the government and, not dismissing the talent and expertise involved, was very much a &quot;hail mary&quot; effort. </p>
<p>SpaceX, on the other hand, is a private corporation with profit and somewhat long term strategies. Failure brings them huge downsides (especially if it involves lives lost) and the upside while great are not really worth the risk. While the early space efforts could &quot;tolerate&quot; some percentage of lost astronauts (most are armed force personnel) there is no way that SpaceX can afford losing their (private) passengers. </p>
<p>So the emphasis on scalability, repeatability, cost effectiveness, safety and reliability will be orders of magnitude more than past efforts. And going to the moon really isn't the priority (possibly the big prize would be a manned mission to Mars)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We succeeded in sending people to the moon because, essentially, it was backed by the support of the government and the entire country.  Everyone <em>wanted</em> to be the first country to the moon.  The space race, fueled by the wider political climate, really lit a fire under everyone's ass.  And when an endeavor is well supported, there are fewer roadblocks.  Or rather, the roadblocks that exist become less prohibitive.  </p>
<p>Just consider the financial roadblock.  The apollo program spent, like, 30 <em>billion</em> dollars in a little over 10 years.  With inflation, that's like $250 billion dollars today, according to <a href="https://www.dollartimes.com/inflation/inflation.php?amount=30&amp;year=1960" target="_blank">this calculator</a>.  </p>
<p>Plus, companies like SpaceX aren't just trying to go to the moon in the exact same way we already did -- despite being incredibly wasteful and single-use, there's no innovation or advantage in just doing it again.  What would be the point in recreating a 60 year old technological feat?  SpaceX in particular is focusing on reliable, safer, less expensive, <strong>reusable</strong> technology.  </p>
<p>Ultimately, private space companies are focusing on the profitability of space (something NASA never really had to do) -- they're working towards building a space business, in other words, not just spending a bunch of money to beat the Soviet Union.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Apollo program cost was 28 billion, but if you look at the total amount of money spent by NASA from 1960 to 1973 which was during the time of the program it was 49 billion. If you adjust that with inflation that give you 490 billion of USD today. </p>
<p>Company don't have an hard time going to the moon, they have an hard time developing technology that are cheap enough, but also potentially profitable. They don't have a government giving them A LOT of money, so they need to develop technology that can provide them with a profit. Company today don't just want to make a spacecraft that go to the moon, they want to make people pay for Space Tourism. That mean that they need a cheaper, reusable, spacecraft with a large enough cargo so that people are ready to pay to get on it. That's a lot harder to do, even with better technology since the 60s</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Safety.</p>
<p>The short of it is, we were willing to take far more risks then than now. The government could afford to lose a couple people in a training accident.</p>
<p>A private company doesn't have that luxury. A single major accident could completely end their endeavor and thus effectively throw all their investments out the window.</p>
<p>So instead of being able to take 1 in 10 odds, or even 1 in 100 odds that something goes wrong like the first space launches, these guys have got to do it with closer to 1 in 1,000,000 odds.</p>
<p>Plus, just like back in the 60's they're still working with cutting edge tech. New inventions, new systems, new programs, all of it needs to be properly vetted and tested before a human life is put on the line.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
