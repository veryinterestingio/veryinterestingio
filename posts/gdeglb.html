<p>There’s been some conflicting information thrown around by covid protesters, in particular that the US death count presently sits at 37k . </p>
<p>The reference supporting this claim is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm</a> , which does list ~35k deaths. Another reference, also from the CDC lists ~65k <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html</a> . Which is correct? What am I missing or misinterpreting? </p>
<p>Thank you</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It says why right on the first page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Provisional death counts are based on death certificate data received and coded by the National Center for Health Statistics as of May 4, 2020. Death counts are delayed and may differ from other published sources (see Technical Notes). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And a bit further down:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*Data during this period are incomplete because of the lag in time between when the death occurred and when the death certificate is completed, submitted to NCHS and processed for reporting purposes. This delay can range from 1 week to 8 weeks or more, depending on the jurisdiction, age, and cause of death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first page only counts reports that have been fully done, including submission of a death certificate. Other ways of counting (such as reporting by local officials) can be much faster and will therefore give a higher count.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically there is a lag for the 37k number. The CDC publishes numbers on a rolling basis, so you usually have to wait at least 2-4 weeks to get the full dataset for a given week. 65k are tentative, 37k have been fully processed. The CDC is still processing the other 28k (plus any new deaths that continue to come in)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During a disaster, deaths are <em>always</em> undercounted for a variety of reasons. That's why the best number for overall impact of the US Covid epidemic is <em>all-cause mortality.</em> That is, all deaths above expected. You can see in this year's data a huge bump from last year. This number captures covid deaths, deaths from other causes where the person did not seek care,  reduction in deaths due to fewer auto accidents, reduction in flu deaths from the lockdown. </p>
<p>&quot;In the early weeks of the coronavirus epidemic, the United States recorded an estimated 15,400 excess deaths, nearly two times as many as were publicly attributed to covid-19 at the time, according to an analysis of federal data conducted for The Washington Post by a research team led by the Yale School of Public Health.</p>
<p>The excess deaths — the number beyond what would normally be expected for that time of year — occurred during March and through April 4, a time when 8,128 coronavirus deaths were reported.</p>
<p>The excess deaths are not necessarily attributable directly to covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. They could include people who died because of the epidemic but not from the disease, such as those who were afraid to seek medical treatment for unrelated illnesses, as well as some number of deaths that are part of the ordinary variation in the death rate. The count is also affected by increases or decreases in other categories of deaths, such as suicides, homicides and motor vehicle accidents.</p>
<p>But in any pandemic, higher-than-normal mortality is a starting point for scientists seeking to understand the full impact of the disease.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read through a bit of this thread and didn't see anyone mention this document:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/coronavirus/Alert-2-New-ICD-code-introduced-for-COVID-19-deaths.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/coronavirus/Alert-2-New-ICD-code-introduced-for-COVID-19-deaths.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/coronavirus/Alert-2-New-ICD-code-introduced-for-COVID-19-deaths.pdf</a></a></p>
<p>The numbers in your first link are only using NVSS (National Vital Statistics System) mortality from code U07.1 and not including U07.2 which is &quot;for clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 where a laboratory confirmation is inconclusive or not available&quot; and therefore &quot;because laboratory test results are not typically reported on death certificates in the U.S., NCHS is not planning to implement U07.2 for mortality statistics.&quot; This may explain the discrepancy as well depending on if the CDC uses both NVSS U07.1 and WHO's U07.2 while NCHS does not. I will say, they could make that a bit more clear as well if that discrepancy is the reason why and it isn't the delays in processing death certificates.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
