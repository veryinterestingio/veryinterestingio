Does this mean that when you eat over a certain limit of calories you body just puts the rest into waste and some into fat? How does it work?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, your body doesn't actually know how many calories you've consummed. How could it ? Until it's fully digested there's no way to know if what you are is eating premium steaks or cardboard. So it does it's best estimate of how hungry you should be and how much food it can currently process.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Two interesting side-effects are that eating slowly will lead to eating less because there's a delay between consuming food and the feeling of satiety. And eating something very sweet (such as desert) will increase the flexibility of you stomach and allow you eat more (the &quot;there's always room for desert&quot; effect). That's because in a wilderness situation, if you were lucky to find high-calorie foods that require little digestion, it was worth eating even if you were already full of roots and such.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hunger is not directly tied to calorie intake. Your body uses a lot of different metrics to decide whether you should be eating, including nutrient levels and how full your stomach is. That system is tuned to our evolutionary past, when our diets were much less calorie-dense. When you're mostly eating stuff like berries and lean meat, it's not possible to consume 2,000 calories in a single meal, so the body prompts you to eat multiple times per day. Someone who eats all that in a single burger will have enough energy to make it through the day, but their body will eventually start screaming at them to eat something anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
