		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Largely yes, all the major veins and arteries follow a similar pattern in everyone. If its important enough to have a name, everyone probably has it! Your body knows how and where to make these just like it knows how and where to make your bones and organs - it's all described in your dna. </p>
<p>But on a smaller level, your capillary networks will be different because they change depending on what you need. The body is amazing creating new vascular pathways when necessary. For example, if one vessel is damaged, alternative vessels will be created to carry to blood flow instead. We also see changes when people build muscle: that muscle tissue needs a blood supply so you'll be gaining blood vessels as well as biceps. This is also true of tumors which are very good at keeping themselves alive by ensuring that the body provides a blood supply for them, which is one of the reasons that enlarged blood vessels in a localised area can be an indication of cancer</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is an amazing video from Michael Levin from Tufts about how the body might know how to build these complex structures:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/RjD1aLm4Thg" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/RjD1aLm4Thg</a></p>
<p>It’s long but fascinating. TLDR version is that all cells have connections with their neighbours similar to the ones neurons in our brains do. These connections create bio-electrical “maps” for where things go. For example, with a small change to those connections he made a zebra fish’s gut turn into an eye with all the parts of an eye. Not gene editing, not manipulating cell by cell, just changing the bio electrical map. </p>
<p>Quite incredible watch!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>DNA contains sequence of genes which in fact is functional design specification of a body. According to this specificaton  body know how to develop. Basically almost all humans have the same number of veins and arteries, but sometimes deviations may occur due to &quot;typos&quot; in specification.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said: generally large veins are consistent among people and small veins differ and the former is part of your DNA.</p>
<p>What I haven't seen mentioned is two interesting things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sometimes there are surprisingly major changes that follow in family lines - normally we'd class these as genetic defects but sometimes they lead to totally functional people with weird quirks. There's a lot of redundancy in the system so it can handle even major modifications.</p>
</li>
<li>Related to the above, things like major injuries, varicose veins or surgery can lead to your body restructuring your veins. My father, for example, had several major blood clots and had his entire Greater Vein of Saph removed, so several of his other leg veins have changed significantly to compensate for its loss.</li>
