		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is the craft actually “ricocheting” off of the atmosphere, or is the angle of entry just too shallow to penetrate? I feel like the films always make it seem like they’d just be shot off into space forever, but what would really happen and why? Would they actually escape earths gravity at their given velocity, or would they just have such a massive orbit that the length of the flight would outlast their remaining supplies?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Apollo entry module flew through the upper atmosphere not-quite-belly-first: this provided some lift, which allowed it to control its direction of flight and caused atmospheric entry to happen more slowly and safely.</p>
<p>Another factor is that the orbit is less sharply curved than the Earth's surface, so that even without lift, there's the possibility of &quot;punching through&quot; the atmosphere and coming out the other side.</p>
<p>The net result is that with too shallow an entry angle, the spacecraft could return back into a high elliptical orbit.  It won't be going as fast as before, so it won't escape Earth's gravity or even get back out to the moon, but it could be hours or days before it completes the orbit and comes back into the atmosphere again.  \The problem is that by that time, everyone will be dead, since the command module doesn't have fuel or oxygen to spare.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Apollo capsules entered the atmosphere at or slightly below escape velocity and the atmosphere slowed them down further, so there was no risk of getting lost in space. But if you leave the atmosphere again you are not going to land where you wanted to, and not at the time when you intended to, and not necessarily with the right angle to do so safely. Your life support might be problematic, your heat shield might get stressed too much, you might end up crashing on solid ground, you are far away from the experts trained to help you. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_reentry" target="_blank">Skip reentry</a> is a real maneuver, but you don't want to do that unplanned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Apollo Command Module produced some lift, by having a deliberately off-centre mass so instead of flying with the heatshield straight ahead it would fly at a slight angle. The lift to drag ratio was about 0.37, ie lift force 37% of drag force.  By contrast aeroplanes and birds commonly have L/D ratios between 10 and 20, ie lift force ten times the drag force.</p>
<p>By rolling the capsule the direction of lift could be changed. Lift upwards and the capsule's descent rate is reduced, sideways to steer laterally, or downwards the capsule will descend faster. Letting the capsule spin would let the lift forces cancel out. This enabled the capsule to land within a target area of a few miles across; an uncontrolled re-entry would be much less precise.</p>
<p>Apollo was designed to fly a lifting re-entry, but not a &quot;full&quot; skip</p>
<p>But perhaps the more significant factor is the perigee altitude of the re-entry. If it's too high the spacecraft could simply fly through the upper atmosphere and carry on without encountering enough drag to bring it down, especially for something coming back from the Moon and thus on a very elliptical orbit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Does anyone else remember the early &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode where a kid stole an Enterprise shuttlecraft but accidentally started to crash it? Captain Picard told him to enter a steep dive, so the shuttle would &quot;bounce off&quot; the atmosphere.
