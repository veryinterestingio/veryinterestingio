		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It often has to do with the amount of time you nap. The longer you sleep, you fall &quot;deeper&quot; asleep as your brain activity changes. This is until your brain kind of resets and the cycle starts all over again after about 90 minutes. If you sleep for a full cycle (90 minutes), you'll likely be waking in a more &quot;shallow&quot; level and arouse easier. If you don't have that long, limit your nap to 25-30 minutes to stay in the first level and you'll have an easier time waking up.</p>
<p>Additionally, it usually takes about 5 &quot;resets&quot; for your brain to run maintenance, hence the recommendation of 7.5-8 hours of sleep per night.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sleep works in stages and cycles. Usually a cycle would last about 1.5 hours, at the end of the cycle you're back in a relatively light sleep. Waking at this point would feel fairly natural, although for a full rest your brain needs a few cycles.</p>
<p>If you wake up disoriented after a nap, it probably meant that you were in the deepest sleep stage rather than completing a cycle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depending on how long your nap is, you might still be in the REM sleep cycle. This is the part of sleep where one gets dreams. If your alarm were to ring in the middle of this cycle, you'll feel extremely lethargic and hard to get up</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you take a nap your body will go into REM sleep faster vs regular sleep. REM, or random eye movement, is a sleep where you actually get a restful type of sleep where you feel better and rested. Just because you sleep every night doesn’t mean you get REM sleep. Shorter periods of sleep seem to help people more because your body isn’t made to sleep long periods then stay awake for long periods. Before lightbulbs and electricity people usually had 2 sleep periods at night. Most people would go to sleep at dusk and sleep until the middle of the night. People would get up make food, read, do activities, have sex, then go back to sleep again. Usually waking up well rested. Now with electricity we stay up way later, force ourselves to wake up earlier and we don’t do the split sleep cycle anymore. We try to cram it all in at once in a 6-8 hour time frame. Naps seems to be our way of making up for this change is our biological sleep pattern. Short naps make us seem more rested because that’s what we use to sleep like before the modern world made us change faster than our bodies have been able to adapt to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
