		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are companies who do polls and use the data they collect plus statistical analysis to determine a rough estimate of listeners. It's not all that much different than TV and Nielson where they send boxes to certain demographics to collect data on what they watch then extrapolate it based off that demographics population density. </p>
<p>In other words, they make an educated guess.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kind of off topic, but a lot of the local auto shops around me would have their mechanics keep a log of what radio station each car was tuned to when it arrived at the shop. They would then use this data to determine which stations they should buy ad time on. But about ten or so years ago there was a shift to where most of the cars arrived with the audio set to either Bluetooth or AUX, so most of those shops stopped buying radio ads altogether</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to surveys Neilson uses a technology called a Portable People Meter. Basically they pay people to wear this pager like device that detects subaudible codes broadcast along with the radio signal. This allows them to determine what radio or TV station you are listening to. Neilson has been doing something similar with TV since the 50s where they pay people to attach a device to their TV to determine what they watch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With more and more people listening to &quot;radio&quot; via IP, they can exactly tell who is listening at which times.</p>
<p>In the yesteryears they had a quite good idea of how far they are sending. Within this area a market analytics and statistics group was contracted to hand out questionnaires to people, ask them on their way out of the grocery store, and sometimes even installed some technical documentation equipment in the radios of voluntary test groups.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have answered one if these surveys before. I got it in the mail and received some kind of nominal thank you for filling it out, like a small gift card.</p>
<p>It was a small card that hard the 7 days of the week in it, and it asked me to fill out what radio stations I usually listened to durring what hours of what days durring a typical week. I generally listened to the radio on my commute to work, so I took the standard rotation if stations that I listened to and spread them out over the week durring the hours I was typically driving </p>
<p>They could then take data from surveys like this to know what stations are being listened to durring what hours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
