		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are four basic ways to correct a child’s behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Positive reinforcement: Giving a reward for doing something good. “You were very good, so you may have a cookie.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Negative reinforcement: Taking away a disliked thing for doing something good. “You were very good, so you get to stay up past your bedtime tonight.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Positive punishment: Giving a bad thing for doing something bad. “You were bad, so I am going to hit you.”</p>
</li>
<li>Negative punishment: Taking away a good thing for doing something bad. “You were bad, so you’re grounded with no phone, computer, or tv.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Spanking is a form of positive punishment. Studies have shown that spanking gets short-term results faster than other methods. However, long-term it is actually less effective than the other methods. In addition, children who were spanked tend to have more tension in their relationships with their parents, are more aggressive, and are more likely to use physical violence as a solution to their problems then children who are never spanked. </p>
<p>However, it is important to note that these studies tend to be retrospective; that is, they look at whether kids were spanked and how they turned out. Because of this, it’s possible that parents of kids who are more aggressive in the first place are more likely to spank, so we can’t 100% say spanking causes this. Nevertheless, the choice to spank seems to be more related to parenting style and culture than to individual kids’ behavior, so it’s likely true that spanking does cause at least some degree of negative psychological effects.</p>
<p>What we do know from studies on humans and other animals is that positive reinforcement works the best long-term. In other words, Susie will learn her table manners much better if she is rewarded for behaving well than punished for behaving poorly. If punishment is needed, then negative punishments such as time outs for younger children and grounding for older children are preferable to positive punishments like hitting. </p>
<p>Again, this isn’t just true for humans. If you take a dog training class, you will be instructed to give treats when the dog does something desired (positive reinforcement.) You will also likely be told never to hit a dog, as it makes them more aggressive. The same principles have also been shown to work in rats, birds, and other animals we have done behavior experiments on. </p>
<p>In short, the only thing spanking brings to the table is it gets faster results. Other than that, it’s inferior to other methods of behavior correction and has the potential to make kids more aggressive, which is why most modern psychologists and pediatricians are discouraging the practice. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The kids tend to not actually avoid the behavior they're spanked for, they just avoid getting caught.</p>
<p>They're more likely to resort to violence in solving their problems later in life.</p>
<p>It tends to damage the trust in the relationship between parent and child. The parent's role in the eyes of the child is to a large extent to be a protector. When the parent is the one causing physical harm, it undermines the status in that role.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most powerful and influential factor in a child development is called <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/basics/attachment" target="_blank">attachment</a>, it is the powerful but invisible emotional link from a child to their caretaker. Attachment is what makes children look up to parents for guidance and safety and provides them with the emotional oxygen they need for their brain to mature.  The developing brain require a safe harbor of unconditional love and acceptance in order to dare explore the world, which in turn is what creates new connections in the brain pathways. The child's brain is wired to go back to their primary attachment when scared and seek safety there.</p>
<p>Spanking creates a terrible paradox for the child's brain, that they cannot understand nor resolve: the very source of their safety just became scary and insecure.  They suddenly learn that they cannot truly be safe anywhere, that their safe harbor can &quot;turn&quot; on them and become the very source of fear and pain they are wired to avoid...by seeking refuge to it. This wrecks havoc on the child development, slowing down their ability to trust and connect not only with the person who did the spanking, but with anyone they used to trust as they learn that the trustworthy persons around them aren't always reliable safety bubbles.</p>
<p>There are a tons of other arguments against spanking, but when it comes to research and pediatricians, <em>THIS</em> is the primary reason, stemming from developmental psychology. Obviously, regular spanking, or severe spankings are worst, but even one single event will slow down the child's development as it will take a while for them to regain the trust into their caregivers. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So basically, it disrupts the parent-child trust bond, reinforces angry/violent behavior, and also does NOT teach the child <em>why</em> they are wrong or shouldn't do something, but instead teaches them to be <em>afraid</em> to do that thing.  In short, it is lazy parenting with a lot of harmful effects.  It's easier to get the anger out and wack your child than to sit down with them and get them to understand why what they are doing is wrong.</p>
<p>As for <em>how much</em> it affects development, well, the degree of how much is still being researched.  It's hard to tell because of general inconsistent things in subjects, like ACE scores (Adverse Childhood Experience).  The subject's resilience scores also change the outcome (positive things that fight against your ACE score, such as being close with a positive adult figure while growing up).  Frankly put, it's different for every child, because of their unique experiences and connections growing up.</p>
<p>In the question of &quot;is once too much&quot;, it depends on how you restrengthen the bond afterwards.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spanking / angry shouting tends to create a sense of fear and dread.  Sometimes the fear is so great that the child will forget what they did wrong.  They would focus on the pain and the anger the parent has.  They might agree just for the sake of agreeing and escaping the pain, but on the inside, they would not have learned.  If a parent says they love their child, but their voice and action shouts murder, then the child will wonder about where they actually stand.  As concerned and good intentioned the parent is, in that moment of time, the child will be overwhelmed with fear and not remember anything else.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
