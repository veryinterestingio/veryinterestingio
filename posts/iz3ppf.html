		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cause your mind isn't busy doing the stuff it does during the day. Night is a time for reflection. Biologically, we're programmed to spend the day finding shelter and food and such. Translated into modern day, whatever you're doing during the day, your brain is probably focused on work or trying to distract yourself from stress.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's mainly because we have less input going on.</p>
<p>We don't have to concentrate on walking around, conversations with others, pay attention to anything etc. All these little things add up to take up a significant amount of our &quot;CPU&quot; brain power.</p>
<p>In today's society we are becoming more and more stimulated with everything. This results in a difficulty in concentrating on important things. (imagine downtown Tokyo vs rural farm land).</p>
<p>Because when we go to bed, it's usually dark, quiet and low stimulation, our brains can start focusing on important things like;</p>
<p>Hey our health isn't so great, maybe we should eat less and work out more so we can live longer.</p>
<p>Or you know what that person was flirting with us, make note for next time you see that as we would like to create offspring.</p>
<p>These thoughts usually end up tracing back to a base instinct.</p>
<p>Source: I'm quite mad and just follow logic most of the time. Also I'm a nighttime creator that will actually get up and do stuff at 3am if it's important.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Sometimes this happens mostly subconsciously and you're just being left with an idea of 'I should try doing Z'.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
