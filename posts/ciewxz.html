		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is entirely species dependent. There are a handful of mechanisms I'm aware of.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Plant is sterile and produces seedless fruit normally, but can reproduce asexually by itself. Seedless banana cultivars are here, as they are triploid and will never produce seed because of that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plant is perfectly fertile, but will produce fruit without seeds if not pollinated. Pineapples are like this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New sterile plants are made every generation by crossing two non-sterile parents with different chromosome counts, such as watermelon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plants are artificially reproduced asexually, such as some grapes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plants are not normally seedless at all but instead are given hormone treatments to make them produce seedless fruit, such as some other grapes.</p>
</li>
<li>A sterile triploid is created by tissue culturing the endosperm from a seed.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All Bramley apple trees are made from cuttings from one tree. If you were to take an apple seed and plant it it is highly unlikely that the fruit would taste nice. Which is why the original tree is so special because that is exactly how it came into existence in 1809.</p>
<p>Most apple trees are grafted onto the root system of smaller trees to make harvesting the apples easier. And you can even get a combination of varieties grafted onto the same tree.</p>
<p>The original tree is has a fungal infection and due to his historical and scientific importance attempts are being made to save it. You can read more <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-44041617" target="_blank">here.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some “seedless” varieties of fruits actually have seeds, they are just so small we don’t notice them when eating the fruit.  If the fruit is left to continue growing past the point of being edible (or at least desirable looking) the seed develops to normal size and can be used to grow new plants.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>so in case you're wondering what &quot;asexual plant reproduction&quot;  is:</p>
<p>if you cut off a branch (easiest from a non woody part) and expose the cut to water nutrients and air, roots will grow at the cut.  and when those roots are grown and there's the leaves up top, it's now an entire plant in and of itself.  sometimes it's called &quot;taking cuttings&quot; or &quot;cloning&quot; and there are products called cloning powder and cloning gel that help stimulate this effect.  primarily the commercial market for this stuff is driven by weed.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>there is natural asexual reproduction too.  pachysandra, for example, propagates primarily by &quot;runners&quot;.  the root network will spread out and go topside and sprout stems and leaves where it's all one organism but if you cut out a section it can survive perfectly well on its own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most commercially produced seedless fruits have been developed from plants whose fruits normally contain numerous relatively large hard seeds distributed throughout the flesh of the fruit.</p>
<p>By contrast, seedless watermelons are grown from seeds. These seeds are produced by crossing diploid and tetraploid lines of watermelon, with the resulting seeds producing sterile triploid plants. Fruit development is triggered by pollination, so these plants must be grown alongside a diploid strain to provide pollen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
