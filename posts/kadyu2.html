		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming you're talking about free proton decay. The confinement and color of the quarks is not really important since this would not be a QCD interaction (theory of the strong interaction between quarks and gluons), but rather from some physics beyond the standard model- that means a <em>new</em> fundamental force. </p>
<p>Hypothetical bosons that couple to leptons and quarks might make it possible to violate baryon number conservation. In this case, some hypothetical 'X' boson* could allow two up quarks to decay to an anti-down quark and positron, leaving you with a neutral pion and a positron. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_decay#Decay_operators" target="_blank">Feynman diagrams on Wikipedia can be really informative</a> to see how this boson could enable these couplings. Once you see how that piece fits, you can assemble all your little Tinker Toys to make the <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/21kIHm.png" target="_blank">proton decay Feynman diagram.</a></p>
<p>It's pretty clear that the quarks remain confined in the pion, so you don't get a free quark out of it (though that pion will eventually annihilate). Similarly, the usual color rules from QCD will apply. </p>
<p>Footnotes: </p>
<p>*Again, I really want to emphasize that this is just a hypothetical particle. The 'X' is just a placeholder name for some hypothetical particle that has some properties analogous to the W/Z boson.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because in GUT theories baryon number is not a symmetry as it is in the SM, and the proton can then decay through certain mechanisms, such as Higgs. The funny part is that the life-time of the proton is believed to be around 10\^(31) years, while the universe is 10\^(10) years old...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Theories that hypothesize the existence of proton decay usually do it as a consequence of mechanisms proposed on the ground of trying to find a mechanism that could convert antimatter into matter. This is one way of explaining why that, despite a typical pair-creation reaction producing both a matter and an antimatter particle from radiant particles like photons, and that presumably, the Universe, at a very early stage in its history, was basically just a mix of highly-energetic photons and their pair-produced matter/antimatter particles, once it expanded and cooled enough that the photons were no longer energetic enough to recreate new matter and antimatter and that antimatter inevitably annihilated with the matter leaving nothing to replace it, there was somehow a net favoring of matter so that everything wasn't all just photons and we could have the matter we need to have the Universe we see today.</p>
<p>Because the familiar four presumed-fundamental interactions - the strong, weak, electromagnetic and gravitational - are, by themselves, incapable of causing the conversion of antimatter to matter, new interactions must be postulated to fulfill this role. These would be capable of changing the quarks which make up protons and neutrons, and the thesis is that, if the interaction can go one way, it can also go the other way. That's something that's generally the case in other domains: for example, chemical reactions can go both ways, e.g. in chemistry, it is possible to dissociate water into H2 and O2 molecules, as much as to burn H2 and O2 together to form water.  And in theory, this can occur purely by chance, however unlikely it may be: e.g. it is entirely possible that, purely on its own, CO2 and water can spontaneously &quot;unburn&quot; into sugar, as much as sugar can burn. It is tremendously unlikely, but not theoretically impossible. Likewise, at the fundamental level, the forward reaction that produces a net gain of matter can also run backwards to produce a net loss of matter, i.e. proton and neutron decay.</p>
<p>Or to put it another way, under these theories quarks <em>would not be</em> stable even when confined into a proton or neutron. Instead, they would be susceptible to effectively spontaneous back-conversion to antimatter (though as other answers point out here, not in a 1:1 fashion). This would cause the proton or neutron to cease being a proton or neutron, i.e. to decay. The odds would be very small, just like the conversion of CO2 and H2O spontaneously into sugar, but not zero. Moreover, the process is exoenergetic, so will occur even at zero temperature: a more apropos chemical analogue would be the metastability of diamonds, which actually slowly char their way into graphite. The truly stable state would be photons, not matter.</p>
<p>However, none of these theories have been shown to be a proper explanation for the abundance of matter, so such a decay remains purely conjectural.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
