		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The olfactory system is a strong part of fish identification of each other.  Fish will even choose a mate based on smell.</p>
<p>I'd like to find a better reference, but <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/07/180723142842.htm" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/07/180723142842.htm</a> talks about how acidification of oceans is ruining fishes sense of smell and they can no longer identify their own kind as well.</p>
<p>Ok, got some.  So for <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.2307/1543264?journalCode=bbl" target="_blank">zebra fish</a>, not only is chemical sensing (smell) important, but their <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2008.0647" target="_blank">first 24 hours alive</a> they will have imprinting of who their kin is based on the smells they learn.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/z86-139" target="_blank">more papers that go into different fish</a> that also find smell, or chemoreception as it's called is the major factor for recognition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fish have a chemosensory apparatus - they can &quot;smell&quot; themselves, and &quot;smell other fish&quot;, looking for the same smell.  Some fish school throughout their lives, some when they are juveniles only, etc.  </p>
<p><em>While fish have big eyes to help them find prey and keep track of each other up close, they rely on their chemosensory system to track other fish of the same species in the vastness of the ocean, says Dr Ashley Ward, a fish biologist at the University of Sydney.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;A fish can smell itself, and recognises others with the same smell,&quot; says Ward, who studies the social behaviour of fish.</em></p>
<p><em>Fish use smell to sniff out a partner with a strong immune system.</em></p>
<p><em>The smell of an individual fish is genetically programmed by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, which are crucial to vertebrate animals' immunity to disease.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;As a by-product, MHC affects the way we and other vertebrates smell,&quot; explains Ward.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Even though all the fish in a school may look alike, when it comes to choosing a mate, picking one that smells different, that is, not related, will ensure the resulting offspring will have the best range of immune responses.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>But when it comes to choosing who to hang out with, the smell of where a fish lives and what it eats is even more important.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Like humans, who take on smells from our diet such as garlic or asparagus, fish clearly smell which individuals live in their microhabitat and preferentially associate with them,&quot; says Ward.</em></p>

<p>In the wider case, it is not uncommon for animals to &quot;bond&quot; with other subspecies or even species if they are raised together.  I encountered an Apfenpinscher who thought he was a pug, and there are often stories of cats and dogs, goats and sheep, and so on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Common among 'forage fish', juveniles hatch alone... then try to stay alive. Eventually when they encounter a shoal which provides safety in numbers, they join.  This is known as 'recruitment'.</p>
<p>Different species have their own preferred ecological habitats. Some have defined preferences for, say, temperature or salinity, and their own feeding habits.</p>
<p>I used to ship about a thousand metric tons per year of frozen, (headed, gutted, tail-off ), sardinops sagax caerulea out of the west coast of California and Baja California, and inspected the processing before shipment. </p>
<p>It was common and annoying to find mackerel [scomber japonicus] or the local anchovy [engraulis mordax], various other incidental species in the landings; but it was very rare to find herring. Might not have been their best thermocline or halocline; maybe they didn't move at a decent speed to keep pace with the shoal. </p>
<p>For whatever reason, they were notably rare. It can be that they were recruited by aggregations exhibiting behavior my fish suppliers could or would not target.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
