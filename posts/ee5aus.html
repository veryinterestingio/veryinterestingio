		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If your heart needs to get stronger it will, that usually means you are in trouble. </p>
<p>Look into the physiological mechanics of most cardiac problems and you will see that most of them aren't the heart muscles failing the body, it's the other way around.</p>
<p>High Blood pressure? Your heart muscle is fine, the problem is that it is working too hard because your body is in bad shape, narrow arteries, obesity, reduced kidney function. It will keep working too, but your arterial walls aren't strong enough to withstand the extra pressure and over time will weaken. </p>
<p>Heart attack? That's a clot or blockage in an artery that starves your heart of oxygen, again it is your body failing your heart muscles.</p>
<p>Low blood pressure? Hormone imbalances mostly. Your heart muscle is normally fine but it keeps getting orders to beat slower and weaker than it is capable of. </p>
<p>Your heart muscle is so amazing compared to the rest of your body that managing your cardiac health is mostly about getting your body closer to the efficiency of your heart to make its job easier.</p>
<p>Cardio expands your blood vessels and improves your circulation. It improves your bodies efficiency at using oxygen and dealing with the by products of anaerobic exercise. It means that your heart gets to take it easy.</p>
<p>An incredibly healthy cardiovascular system is one you are likely to find in people with low excess body weight, active lifestyle, and a good diet that doesn't tax their metabolic systems. This hypothetical person will have a slow heart rate with a strong &quot;beat&quot; but not high blood pressure. Because the body is up to snuff and will have vessels large enough to allow blood to flow easily and a body efficient in using it.    </p>
<p>TLDR; You heart is so powerful, efficient, and sexy that it mostly doesn't need to improve, it's your scrub-ass &quot;everything else in your body&quot; that fails your heart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everything an organism does costs resources to do. The better you can conserve resources, the better your chances of survival generally speaking, which means that evolution favours those who make the most efficient use of what they've been dealt. Essentially, the body will do the absolute bare minimum it needs to do to keep you healthy (although it is not equipped to deal with the extremely sedentary and indulgent lifestyle of modern humans). If the body doesn't need to reinforce the heart, then it won't do so, because doing so would be spending energy for no perceived purpose. It's important to note that evolution has a very hard time selecting traits that only manifest after reproduction, since these traits have no effect on how likely your genes are to be passed on. Since the negative effects of a sedentary lifestyle only really come out in full after the typical human has already has children, they never get selected out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body seeks a sustainable balance at minimal resources. At a normal heart rate, the body has no reason to make it any stronger.  It's already perfectly suited to beating at that rate indefinitely.  When you put it faster during exercise, however, it it beating at a rate faster than it can sustain indefinitely, so it gets stronger to compensate.  </p>
<p>In a sense we are tricking the body into spending more resources than it normally would but making it think it needs to adapt to a an environment that doesn't actually exist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Increased heart rate is just a side-effect of exercise, its not the goal of exercise.</p>
<p>There are a myriad of benefits to exercise, and one of them is achieved by the increased blood volume that occurs in your body as a response to physical activity. Your heart having to push more blood through the body triggers a strengthening adaptation response similar to working out your muscles, where parts of it get larger and stronger.</p>
<p>This increases your heart's overall blood pumping capacity, lowering your resting heart rate and blood pressure, increased oxygen delivery throughout the body, etc. Sitting there doing nothing with a high heart rate doesn't achieve any of that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Cardio exercise gives it a sustained stimulus to make it stronger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
