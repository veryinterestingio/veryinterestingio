		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are different parts to memory, one of which is memory recall. There are also standardized ways in which the brain can essentially malfunction including a recall error where one's memory is primed but there is a failure to recall the relevant information while the feeling of familiarity still remains. An example of this is the tip of the rounge phenomenon. Your brain knows there is something to recall but fails to recall it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's like when a video game part is so frustrating you rage quit but when you calmly come back later you beat it on the first try. </p>
<p>More specifically, memory likes contextual clues which is why just concentration isn't always enough. When you can't recall a memory we try to imagine the contextual clues like &quot;where was I when this happened? Who was I with?...&quot;. If you get frustrated it's harder to &quot;go back in time&quot; mentally but the clues are still stacking so when you are calmer or when your environment changes it could all click into place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’d heard it was because your brain stores memories and information in “bins” almost like a computer stores it in folders. When you are trying to remember something your brain will go into the related “bin” and look for it...only sometimes it chooses the wrong bin, and accidentally locks you into the wrong one looking for information. So when you stop thinking about it, the brain takes you out of the specific bin, allowing it to access the other bins where the information is actually stored.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your mind is like a pinball machine, when you think intently on something with full focus, the pegs on that machine get closer to each other so the ball don't have much room to move around the brain, while when you're not thinking about that problem, the pegs become less dense and your brain has access to chunks of information that were unavailable to you because of the einstellung effect</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
