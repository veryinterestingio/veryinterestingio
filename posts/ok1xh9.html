		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During the day, sunlight warms the surface of the Earth (and for this we'll kind of lump the actual surface of the Earth and the lower portion of the atmosphere in direct contact with the surface of the Earth). At night, this heat is radiated back into the higher atmosphere and space, and so the portion of the surface of the Earth experiencing night cools (the surface is also radiating heat during the day, it's just that at night there is effectively no source of heat to counteract the loss of heat to the atmosphere and space). At any given spot, the surface of the Earth has lost the most heat from the previous day shortly after the sunrises because incoming solar radiation is not really heating the surface of the Earth effectively until the sun is above the horizon (i.e. until light is shining directly on the Earth). A very simple analogy would be a pot of water on the stove that you heated in cycles, e.g., you turned on the burner for 30 minutes, turned off the burner for 30 minutes, turned on the burner for 30 minutes, etc. In this scenario, when would the water be it's coolest? Basically at the end of the 30 minute &quot;burner off&quot; periods and shortly into the next &quot;burner on&quot; period because it takes time for the water and pot to radiate the heat accumulated during the &quot;burner on&quot; period and a little bit of time for the water and pot to start warming up with the burner back on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The moment before daybreak is the coldest because the sun hasn’t been shining for the longest possible time. The sun heats up the surface during the day, so even at night the heat radiates back into the atmosphere. So the longer the surface goes without constant heating, the more it will cool down. Right before daybreak, the surface has spent the longest time cooling, and when the sun starts coming up again, the angle is still not high enough to heat the surface until a little bit later. That’s why it’s colder at dawn than it is at midnight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: The sun heats the Earth , and at night earth is radiating that heat back to the atmosphere. As the sun barely rises, it heats the layer of air closest to the earths surface, (but not the surface of the Earth), which causes that air to rise. Cooler, denser air drops to fill the void, and remains cool until the sun can effectively heat the surface and the ambient temperature rises.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Temperature where you live mostly depends on how much the sun has already heated the ground/air - not on how bright the sun is right at that moment.</p>
<p>Naturally, the coldest part of the day won't be when the sun is lowest, but when the sun has been &quot;off&quot; for the longest amount of time.  That's just before dawn, when the sun has not been heating the ground all night.</p>
<p>Similarly, the hottest part of the day isn't noon, when the sun is shining brightest, but early evening, after the ground has been heated for even longer.  </p>
<p>And, by the same logic, we get the seemingly counterintuitive, hot summer night.  Even though the sun isn't shining, it's super hot out because the summer sun has been shining on the ground all day, and only just stopped.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
