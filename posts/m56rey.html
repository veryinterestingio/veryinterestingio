		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think anyone knows this. Viruses that are thought to contribute to cancer development (oncogenesis) are called oncogenic viruses. Many integrate into the genome, and in doing so can damage some genes that act against oncogenesis (in one way or another). Others have some persistent active state that changes cell biology in a way that increases the risk of cancer development. However, it's not exactly common for people infected with oncogenic viruses to develop cancer. It's perhaps better to say that they are better than other cellular insults at causing precancerous changes which make a cell more likely to end up cancerous.</p>
<p>For the most part, even if reinfection with identical strains is <em>possible</em>, people get sick with SARS-CoV-2 once and then they're over it and virus is no longer detectable. In most cases where viral genetic material is still detected in nasal swabs by PCR, the same samples cannot be used to infect cells in a dish (which are much less protected than cells in a body), suggesting the virus is not viable. There is some controversy over whether a non-trivial subset of patients see continuous production of viable virus in certain tissues, particularly the gut. If that is the case then if a few other conditions are satisfied there is a theoretical possibility that SARS-CoV-2 could increase the risk of certain cancers in a subset of patients (should vaccines or treatments fail to address this).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s definitely too soon to tell, but my best guess would be probably not. The viruses that cause cancer like <a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/publications/focused-on-health/7-viruses-that-cause-cancer.h17-1592202.html" target="_blank">HPV, Hepatitis-C, HIV, etc</a> are usually chronic infections that we have no cure for. Covid, on the other hand, seems to be a short lived infection in most people, and the “long haulers” will usually test negative for active disease even if they’re still experiencing disease complications.</p>
<p>There has been some concerns that covid may be triggering <a href="https://breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13058-020-01360-0" target="_blank">breast cancer recurrence in some patients</a>, but there isn’t sufficient data there to indicate if this is or is not happening.</p>
<p>The very real and known impact of covid on cancer that is happening is that many hospitals and clinics around the world shifted to covid care and stopped doing routine screening exams for cancer, as well as stopping regular doctor’s visits where symptoms may be evaluated. Some areas the medical system quickly went back to regular care, but others are still not running at full speed. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7599065/#__sec1title" target="_blank">Some estimates</a> show screening dropped by 80-90% from late January to April last year.  I work at a cancer registry (we track cancer at a population level) and we’re only starting to see the full impact of the 2020 cancer diagnoses. And down the road, there may be an uptick of later stage disease cancers from people who couldn’t get screened this year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Short answer is **maybe.** As others have posted, this virus doesn't (as far as we know) act like other oncogenic viruses such as HPV16 and 18 (squamous cell cancers of the head/neck, cervical cancers), HHV8 (Kaposi sarcoma), or EBV (various lymphomas). These viruses, through specific mechanisms, turn on genes that promote cancer formation and turn off genes that prevent carcinogenesis. The COVID virus does not function in a way to induce oncogene expression.</p>
<p>However, as everyone is aware, COVID infection can induce long-lasting, chronic lung inflammation. Any chronic inflammation and scarring (and subsequent tissue irritation) predisposes to cancer formation as the cells of these tissues cyclically die and are replaced by normal cells, over and over again. As these cells now have a high turnover rate, there are more opportunities for DNA mutations as the cells continuously replicate, and when one of these cells accidentally gets hit with the right combination of mutations, it becomes neoplastic (cancerous).</p>
<p>I predict we will see an increased incidence of squamous cell carcinomas and maybe less-so adenocarcinomas of the lung in the future. Whether or not COVID-induced inflammation of other organs (kidneys, brain, lymph nodes, etc...) would increase risk of cancers related to those organs, I don't know. But lung... well - I think the likelihood is there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't know, but it's not likely.</p>
<p>The two major ways viruses lead to cancer are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Directly messing with the cell pathways that regulate cellular growth and programmed death. DNA viruses usually do this if they are a species that needs to hijack the DNA replication biological machinery of the cell, since it is only expressed during a certain phase of the cell life and viruses want to forcedly lock the cell in that state. As they create a big mess in the nucleus, they also want the cell to not read it as excessive genetic damage, an event that would lead to programmed cellular suicide (apoptosys), which is one of the ways pre-cancerous cells are eliminated. Coronaviruses are RNA based so they don't do any of this. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Causing chronic damage or inflammation. The cells replicate more than usual to repair the damage, more replication means more DNA being produced, which means more chances to make mistakes and introduce DNA mutations. While it seems covid can some soemtiems cause long lasting infections it seems to be fairly rare. </p>
</li>
<li>Expressing some factor that leads to higher proliferation of a certain cellular type, which is usually the virus specific target: the virus wants its target to proliferate more, so that it has more targets to replicate within. This generally happens with virures that target immune system cells, which shouldn't be the case with covid. </li>
</ul>
<p>Of course there are other, more niche, rare and specific ways a virus can lead to cancer and then only time can tell: cancers can evolve over decades, so we may not know until the second half of the century.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
