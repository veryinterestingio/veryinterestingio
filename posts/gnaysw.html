		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The money is just moving slower.</p>
<p>Let's say you make $60,000 as a trucker. Normally that money gets split up in paying for housing, food, clothing, and other essentials, some amount going into savings, and then some amount paying for entertainment, like buying a new TV.</p>
<p>When a recession happens, spending drops. You start spending less on frivolities, so you end up not buying that new TV/Home Entertainment System.</p>
<p>But now Best Buy is selling less stuff, so they're bringing in less. The trucking industry sees a loss in freight to haul, and you lose some hours.</p>
<p>Typically there is some industry somewhere with a large slowdown that is triggering the reduced spending, causing the cascade. However, the slowdown of that industry is not necessary for the recession to continue. The impact can live on its own for some time, similar to how someone tapping their brakes on the highway can cause a cascade of people slowing down behind them well after they've taken off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The value of assets (things like homes, ownership in companies, etc) is decreasing. There is no cash money being thrown into a big hole, or aggregating somewhere out of reach. Headlines like &quot;such and such person lost X dollars due to the stock market crash&quot; are misleading. They lost zero dollars. The value of their owned assets simply went down in value.</p>
<p>The reason why this becomes a problem for everyone is that investor confidence goes down, and companies and people stop buying things. If a recession is imminent, a company might choose not to buy a certain machine that they otherwise would have, thus decreasing their productivity. The company that makes the machines might have been counting on that sale (and many other now cancelled orders), so they'll have to lay some people off. Now all the machine manufacturer's suppliers have to lay people off too. And of course those laid of people are going to tighten their belts as well. You can see how this quickly ripples out and causes everyone to stop spending. This is what a recession is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you blow up a balloon, its surface area becomes much bigger. Where does that area go when you deflate the balloon?</p>
<p>Many assets in January 2020 were 'puffed up' - stocks, housing prices, art, etc. Comes the panic, and the air goes out of the balloon. So if you think of the total amount of wealth as the balloon's surface area, it's clear that some of it disappears as the balloon deflates. But it's paper wealth that gets destroyed. You still have your house or your stocks - that is, you physically own them - but their value has been reduced. That's a scary thing for most people. </p>
<p>Since JM Keynes in the 1920's, governments everywhere have been afraid of deflation (generally falling prices), and have instituted policies that actively encourage inflation (generally rising prices). When people feel their homes/stocks/other assets are rising in value, they will spend more, which provides more jobs (and taxes!). When assets are falling - like they are now - people pull in their horns, buy less, and reduce their economic activity. This can lead to recession due to a collapse in demand, and the vicious cycle can be brutal to break.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two factors to this. The “operating” economy and the stock market. While both are interrelated, how they impact the average person differs.</p>
<p>In a recession, the economy, both operating and stock market, slows down for whatever reason. </p>
<p>This impacts the operating economy due to less money circulating. With fewer people buying goods/services (“stuff”), companies start cutting hours or laying people off. Since people are not making as much money, they buy less stuff. Since less stuff is being bought, companies cut hours or lay people off, and so on. This impacts the average person because most people need to work to survive. A reduction in income means they have les money on hand to pay for food, rent, and other stuff. But nothing has changed hands; no one reached into your pocket to take money from you. Simply put, you aren’t earning as much, so you have less money.</p>
<p>The stock market is impacted in the same way. If companies aren’t selling stuff, their earnings reports come in lower than expected. This makes people sell their stock, since the company is doing poorly. Since share price is determined by the balance of buying and selling stocks, the share price decreases. This impacts the average person because many people have some form of savings or investments tied to the performance of the market. When the market performance drops, so do the numbers in people’s retirement accounts. But again, no one reached into their pockets to take the money. The “money” in the retirement accounts is tied to how the companies are valued. The valuation of a company’s stock is driven by what price people are buying and selling it, which is an expression of trust/confidence in the company.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't go anywhere, it just slows down how quickly it moves through the economy.</p>
<p>Let's say I earn $100 and buy a pair of shoes. Then the shoemaker buys his kid a $100 train set for his birthday. The toy store owner takes his wife out to a $100 dinner. The chef buys new pots and pans for the restaurant, spending $100. The kictchenware store owner signs his kid up for $100 worth of piano lessons. The piano teacher pays $100 to the mechanic to fix her car, and that's me.</p>
<p>That $100 generated $600 worth of economic activity... now, imagine that because I don't earn $100, this chain doesn't start. Now that economic activity is lost even if that $100 is still sitting in somebody's pocket or bank account.</p>
<p>The other thing that happens is that asset values fall, but there isn't defined money backing that value -- just what people in general are willing to pay. If a share of stock sold for $50 last year is now only selling for $40, that $10 didn't go anywhere -- it's just a lower amount somebody is willing to hand over in return for that share today.</p>
<p>Similar to the above shoe example... maybe when times were good, you'd pay $100 for a pair of shoes, but now you'd only consider buying them if they're on sale for $60. That additional $40 isn't part of the shoe transaction that goes elsewhere -- it's just money you're choosing to hold on to reallocate elsewhere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
