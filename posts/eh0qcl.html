		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the sock case the additional friction comes from surface tension of the water. This causes the sock to stick to your skin. People saying polarity of the water matter are implicitly implying that oil soaked clothing wouldn't stick to your skin which is untrue.
But why does surface tension matter? When the sock is in contact with your skin water droplets bridge the gaps between the fabric and you. These bridges make capillary forces that attract you to the sock. These are the same forces that make wet sand stick to things. These forces also vanish when the contact is fully flodded (which is why you can't build an underwater sand castle and clothes don't stick to you underwater). </p>
<p>In the case of the car, the scale has changed now the capillary forces are too small to be important compared to the other forces. In this case hydrodynamic forces (forces that move water about) dominate and these are enough to keep the surfaces separated. This means that there is no (or very little) actual surface contact and the friction is dominated by the viscosity of the fluid. Water has a low viscosity so the friction is also low.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water is a polar molecule - one side electrically negative and the other positive. Because of its polarity, water likes to stick to other polar molecules, including itself. Your skin is somewhat polar, too, which is why sweat and water stick to it. A wet sock is a mesh filled with water, which then sticks to you.</p>
<p>Furthermore, wet clothing isn't very permeable to air. It might be able to form a weak seal against your skin, if you squeeze any air underneath it out. That'll require extra force to break.</p>
<p>Finally, wet clothing is considerably heavier than dry clothing. That may provide a higher normal force and thereby frictive force on the top of your foot.</p>
<p>Instead of sliding your entire sock on, I suggest you smush your sock so it looks like a circle, place your toes in, and then roll the rest on like a wet, foot condom. Or forego wearing wet socks at all. They may lead to blisters.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>edit: Some comments.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Morning has come and your replies showed me that I answered a different question. My b. I took a quick shot at the actual question in a reply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As others have pointed out, non-polar liquids would behave similarly. The latter two effects are the most pertinent. </p>
</li>
<li>I am still unsure about the grammar of &quot;wet, foot condom&quot; versus &quot;wet foot condom&quot;. Please discuss.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>so in the example of a wet sock, the fibers in the sock are absorbing the water, making them swell up. this swelling up increased the amount of sock surface area that your foot is in contact with, meaning more friction. </p>
<p>to a lesser extent, in the spaces that the swollen fibers do not fill, there are water molecules that will fill the space which adds to the friction. </p>
<p>in your example of hydroplaning, the key difference there is that the water is not absorbed by the asphalt but rather creates a separate layer that will literally lift your car up off the road. tires have much more friction on asphalt than on water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
