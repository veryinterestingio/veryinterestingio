		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Laws and practices vary by country, the following applies in the UK.</p>
<p>The UK (and the EU) has largely adopted United Nations Economic Commision for Europe (UNECE) regulations, which state that if the true speed is <em>x</em> km/h then the indicated speed must be between <em>x</em> and <em>(1.1x + 4)</em>. This is usually tested at 40, 80, and 120 km/h. This means that if your speedometer reads, for example, 50 mph, then your true speed might be slower but should not be faster. However if your vehicle is faulty or improperly modified this may no longer be the case.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/main/wp29/wp29regs/2018/R039r2e.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/main/wp29/wp29regs/2018/R039r2e.pdf</a></p>
<p>These rules mean that vehicle speedometers will in general have a systematic error, with some being more accurate than others.</p>
<p>GPS is subject to no such rules and will be more accurate. Others have answered this in more detail.</p>
<p>Onto the police. In the UK, speed cameras use a time-and-distance method. The camera must take <em>two</em> photos of your vehicle, both showing the vehicle and a known position and time, and the speed calculated from the distance the vehicle moves. The photos may be a couple of seconds apart as with a GATSO camera, or taken by &quot;average speed cameras&quot; several miles apart. Radar or laser speed measurement is used to trigger speed cameras but in the UK a radar measurement by itself is not enough for a fine or conviction. </p>
<p>If you are pulled over by a police officer for speeding, the police car will have been following your vehicle for some time. Traffic police cars have their speedometers calibrated regularly to ensure accuracy. By the police office maintaining a reasonably constant distance, the speedo reading on their own car indicates the speed you are doing, and the whole thing will be recorded on video. Again, a police officer may use a radar gun to detect speeders, but must follow the speeding car to get sufficient evidence.</p>
<p>CORRECTION: As per /u/SynAck_Fin, radar is not approved but <em>laser</em> devices operated by an office <em>are</em> valid evidence, meaning following the car isn't needed.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A LOT of car manufacturers add about 5-7% of your real speed to speedometer value snown to you. Tested on VW Polo, Hyundai Solaris / Creta, Kia Rio / Soul, Skoda Rapid / Octavia, some Renault, Smart, BMW and even Mercedes. Everytime their speedometer showed 80 km/h, my (and not only mine) GPS showed 75 km/h. Straight line, no acceleration, good GPS satellites signal. So car speedometer may be more accurate in some cases, but as far as I know, it is designed to show a bit more speed for some purposes. (I can say only about cars in Russia and showing speed in km/h, this may be not true for some other countries and speed units)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First... Both have downsides. Your speedometer is more precise, but potentially less accurate, if it's either poorly calibrated (rare) or if you've changed wheel/tire size or if your tires are improperly inflated, etc. This is because it measures speed based on rotation of the wheels (actually the drive shaft, but conceptually it's almost inconsequential), along with calibrated assumptions about tire circumference.</p>
<p>(EDIT: cars have started using wheel sensors rather than drive shaft sensors for some time now, it turns out.)</p>
<p>GPS of course uses satellite triangulation, and measures your change in location over time. However, each position is plus or minus as much as several meters, so at any given moment your speed measurements could swing more wildly (less precision) but over longer time with more data points, the average speed is very accurate (close to the real speed) regardless of wheels and tires. Most GPS speed readouts are smart enough to not remeasure your speed based on each pair of position points, but rather average them over a short time with several measurements, to account for error that can arise in single measurements. Still, not necessarily accurate to know your real-time speed.</p>
<p>(EDIT: several people have pointed out I am wrong about how GPS speed measurements work, at least for high end devices. Turns out in more and more devices it's based on Doppler shifts, so the precision is likely much better than I thought. Still, don't try to get out of speeding tickets by claiming your GPS says you weren't too fast!)</p>
<p>Now, cops will use neither of these. They measure your speed externally with radar or laser, which give them very good results (most of the error - sometimes cited up to 10% legally speaking - arises from user error, or non-ideal conditions like multiple vehicles in close proximity, etc). They will not accept your promise that the speedometer or GPS says you weren't speeding. Moreover, I think you'd be hard pressed to use either as evidence in a court, due to the possible issues or manipulation in both cases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
