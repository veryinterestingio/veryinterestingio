<p>There are additional gains depending on the material of the ball, for example if the material is somewhat elastic, then pre-stressing or pre-stretching the material keeps the tension forces closer to the impact area, which more efficiently converts the momentum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short version, the collision with the ground is more elastic, so the ball retains more energy.</p>
<p>If you drop a perfectly elastic ball and negate wind resistance after it hits the ground, it will come up to the same height you dropped it from. If the collision is less elastic, you lose height. That's what's happening. The ground is absorbing some of the energy as heat.</p>
<p>Edit: changed &quot;the gate&quot; to &quot;negate&quot; because voice to text, apparently, hates me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Better coefficient of restitution aka how much useful energy is lost when 2 objects hit. Ranges from 0-1. 0 means all the energy gets wasted and 1 is a perfect transfer of energy. A better way to think of it is by deformation. 0 has very high deformation and 1 has no deformation. Putting more air into the ball decreases how much the ball deforms upon impact making it bounce higher as more energy is transferred. A steel ball should bounce the highest of all because it would deform the least.</p>
<p>Less deformation = better bounce.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Of all shapes with the same surface area, a sphere has the largest volume. Since the surface area of a ball is <em>relatively</em> constant (squashing the ball does not stretch its surface very much), anything you do to deform the ball is necessarily <em>decreasing its volume</em>.</p>
<p>Boyle's Law states that, in a closed system, pressure and volume are inversely related. So as the volume of our squashed ball decreases, the pressure in the ball increases. This increase in pressure applies in all directions, but because the material of the ball isn't particularly stretchy, in aggregate it acts to return the ball to a spherical shape.</p>
<p>So when a well-pressurized ball &quot;bounces&quot;, it is deformed against the ground, the internal pressure dramatically increases, and upon returning to its lowest-possible-pressure and highest-possible-volume state, the ball pushes back against the ground (with whatever deformed surface area is in contact with the ground) and the force applied through the ball material from that air pressure supplies the acceleration of the &quot;bounce.&quot;</p>
<p>When a deflated or underinflated ball hits the ground, the deformation still occurs, but because the &quot;initial&quot; pressure was not as high, the &quot;after&quot; pressure is not as high either. With less internal pressure working to return the ball to a spherical shape, its pressure cannot supply the same amount of force to the ground, and so the bounce is weaker.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simple answer is 'conservation of energy'. And more technical answer is 'hysteresis'.
Ball with less pressure would lose more energy during the collision with the ground. The reason is hysteresis. Generally, a ball has to deform (read as compress) when it hits the ground. When it lifts off from the ground then it would regain its shape but in the process it would lose some energy. The material rubber losing energy during compression-uncompression cycle is called hysteresis.  Intuitively, the ball which compresses more would  lose more energy. Thus, bounces less height.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
