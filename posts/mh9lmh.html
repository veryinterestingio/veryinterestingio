		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wine has a lot of aromatic compounds that hit the nose when drinking. Different varieties of wines, even if they’re made from the same grape, can have different compounds. When you cook with wine, most of those aromatic compounds either evaporate, burn, or denature. So when you cook with wine, the variety of wine is what usually matters. Any dry white can be used in a recipe that uses a dry white wine because they all have similar flavors that survive cooking. Same thing with recipes that call for reds, although if you’re making a tomato sauce, sometimes you might want to use a red wine that’s sweeter to give a little extra sweetness to your sauce.</p>
<p>Edit: Thank you for the awards! This thread really blew up. I’d also like to address something that I’ve seen in a few replies and on some other comment chains. “Don’t cook with a wine you wouldn’t drink” isn’t necessarily a rule you should follow. You can use cheap wines or wines that have gone a bit off from staying unused for too long in most things. I personally use the Charles Shaw (2 buck Chuck) Sauvignon Blanc for recipes that call for dry whites (not saying I wouldn’t drink it, Charles Shaw is probably the best cheap wine). I wouldn’t open a $20+ wine only to pour a splash into my pan or a cup into my sauce. Sure, if the wine is putrid tasting, it might ruin your food, but an unimpressive cheap wine can still be used to make an excellent sauce. Buy a 2 buck Chuck, and use it over the course of 1-2 weeks. Save your favorite wine for when you want to drink it. Having that open bottle might encourage you to experiment more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many of the flavor compounds that are present in wine will burn off when cooking.  If you took two red wines that tasted fairly different to you, boiled each of them for a few minutes, let them cool, and then tried them again, you'll find that they now taste much more similar - lots of the subtle flavors that made one wine seem light and fruity but the other rich and earthy have burned off, leaving only the major flavor compounds in all wines - acidity, sweetness, and savoriness.  You can get somewhat different results if you used wines at some extremes - like using a very sweet wine with low acidity versus using a wine with high acidity with little residual sugar, you'd probably taste a difference in the final product.  But in general, and since most of us are just using a splash of wine in a dish, there's not a huge difference in varieties.  Don't use the most expensive wine on your shelf, but use something that tastes good that you'd like to drink anyways.</p>
<p>That's also part of the reason they say not to cook with expensive extra-virgin olive oil, or other oils with lots of flavor compounds, as well.  Extra-virgin is awesome for dressing salads or drizzling on a finished dish, because it tastes so much better than cheaper grades of oil.  But if you were to cook with it, all of those flavor compounds that you're paying extra money for will burn off.  And in the case of cooking oil, since it's getting to the highest temperatures, those compounds will literally smoke and burn, and can lend some bad flavors to your food and create some harmful chemicals that you don't want to eat.  So use cheaper oils with a high smoke point for cooking, and save the fancier stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some do, high end restaurants often use specific wines in the dish. But most use a grade of &quot;cooking wine&quot; which is quite low quality but gives you the distinct wine taste. Good wines often spend a lot of effort getting intricate flavours just right, which is very noticeable when drinking it alone. Once it's mixed in to food those subtle and intricate flavours are often lost to the other iningredients, or can be achieved by changing the recipe slightly which would be the cheaper option.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another answer talks about how the complexity is kind of burned off or otherwise destroyed by cooking: I'd wager it's also simply covered up by all the other flavors as well as being diluted by the other food in the dish.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
