		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That would be...almost impossible to determine. We only know of about 700+ dinosaur species and we’d be shooting in the dark regarding how big of a dinosaur population the various ecosystems throughout all of the Jurassic, Triassic and Cretaceous eras could support. We don’t have the information needed to really accurately guess that. It’d be tough to even ballpark it. </p>
<p>We could probably assume their peak population was just before their mass extinction but there’s the real possibility of that being inaccurate. The big limiting factor here would be how many plants there were and how many herbivores could they support? Then we’d use that base as a guess into carnivore populations. The biggest problem here is we have no idea what percentage of the dinosaurs we have discovered as fossils and the same holds true for plant fossils and non-dinosaur fossils, which could also be prey items.</p>
<p>Any guess would be just that, a total guess.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add what was already stated, the life span of the brontosaurus is estimated to be ~80 years.  The techniques used to date dinosaur fossils arent that accurate, and certainly can't tell us the age within 80 years.  So for all we know, none of the brontasauri that we have found fossils from were alive at the same time.  Same logic works with any dinosaur.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have a specific answer. We only have a consensus of any species populations due to advanced technology... we understand nearly everything we know from dinos due to fossils. Even if we dug up the earth, I don't think we could ever know the &quot;peak&quot; because it would be so hard to determine and it would only be guesssing as many factors must be considered.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Impossible to tell. We probably only have fossils of a fraction of the species for any period of time. There was a decline in species numbers towards the end of the Cretaceous but whether that was reflected in numbers of individuals is hard to tell. </p>
<p>New species are being unearthed every year so it's impossible to say when we will have discovered every species, let alone estimated numbers of individuals</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like others said, impossible to determine for sure. </p>
<p>But probably now or in the not so distant past. Passenger pigeons numbered up to five billion, there are at least 10 million sparrows, 200 million European starlings in the US alone. Dinosaurs are doing very well for themselves these days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
