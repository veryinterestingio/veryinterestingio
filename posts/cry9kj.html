	<title>ELI5: Why is it that sometimes when you swallow something like a lozenge or capsule of some kind, it feels like it’s stuck in your throat for some time after? I mean, it can’t actually be, because it feels that way long after the thing would’ve dissolved, so what is giving that distinct sensation?</title>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your throat is very sensitive. That feeling of something 'stuck' is actually a generally universal feeling that your body signals to indicate 'irritation'.</p>
<p>When you swallow a medicine cap, tablet or suck on a lozenge, your throat may just not be that used to swallowing something that isn't as soft as chewed food. The texture and dryness may also play a part, and it registers as a sign that you may have swallowed something unnatural.</p>
<p>Another thing that causes the 'something stuck in throat' feeling is acid reflux, where your stomach acid comes back out and gives you burns in the esophagus. The irritation can feel like a mild blockage to having a ball there that no matter how you try you can't 'swallow' down and can get extremely infuriating.</p>
<p>In other words, that feeling is triggered for ANY time your throat has discomfort and irritation. You're just used to associating it to stuck food because that's happened the most.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Sometimes the tablet feels like it’s still in your throat because it really is, just waiting for its opportunity to escape.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is mostly because your throat is sensitive, but I remember reading somewhere that dry swallowing medicine can actually give you ulcers as it scratches down your throat, so make sure you drink some water with it!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just had this with my eyd. There was some teeny tiny bug right on my pupil, and it was sticky so it was there for days. Whenever my really sensitive eyelid went over it and off it again it felt like there was some actual gravel stone under my eye lid, which is what i thought it was. Sooner or later, the bug itself barely bothered in fact i didnt even notice but because the eye lid was so sensitive i went to the doctor and said there is something big under my eyelid, where there in fact wasnt anything.</p>
<p>Long story short: its the same concept, your throat is sensitive and might get sore on the inside from solid things</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally when this feeling occurs the pill or tablet is actually stuck in your throat or esophagus.  It is best to take medications with a full glass of water to prevent this.  But when it does happen you’ll want to continue sipping water and possibly eat some food to dislodge the medicine from the side of the throat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
