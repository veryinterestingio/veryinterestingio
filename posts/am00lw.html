<p>They seem to show that Methane has pretty small absorption peaks in the terrestrial radiation spectrum compared to something like CO2 or water vapor. Since it's also much less prevalent in the atmosphere it seems unintuitive that it should have such a disproportionately large global warming potential(Over 28 the GWP of CO2 according to the EPA website).</p>
<p>So what's going on here? Does Methane have other peaks in it's spectrum outside the range of the graphs that account for it's high warming effect? Are there other factors our models need to take into account to properly describe the heat trapping abilities of gases in the atmosphere? Am I misunderstanding what global warming potential actually means? Are the graphs just wrong, or incorrectly labelled/interpreted?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good question.  Two-part answer, but first an important background concept: greenhouse gases only absorb certain wavelengths of light, and each GHG is active in a different set of wavelengths.  </p>
<p>1) The more of a greenhouse gas you add, the less effective it becomes.  Once you've added enough to strongly absorb the wavelengths where it's most effective, you get diminishing returns by adding more.  You can't squeeze blood from a stone, as they say.  This is called &quot;band saturation&quot;. Generally, absorption is proportional to <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=log\(x\)+from+1+to+100" target="_blank">log(concentration)</a>.</p>
<p>2) Methane absorbs in a wavelength range very different from other GHGs like water and carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>So because there's already so much H2O and CO2 in the atmosphere, adding more of those gases does relatively little compared to adding more methane, which is very scarce in the atmosphere. (<em>relatively</em>: they do still have an effect.)  The small amount of methane absorbs in a wavelength range that isn't saturated yet, so its effect is relatively strong.</p>
<p>If the atmosphere had a lot of methane, and only small amounts of CO2 and H2O, the situation would be reversed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems that it’s both due to the absorption in the more energetic part of earth’s spectrum as well as the propensity for methane to produce other greenhouse gases such as water vapor and CO in the upper atmosphere, where they normally would not be concentrated otherwise. While water vapor has a higher degree of absorption, it also has a tendency to condense and precipitate, so it removes itself from the atmosphere, while methane extends its atmospheric lifetime.</p>
<p>This was a really good question, and it is by no means intuitive that methane should be a potent greenhouse gas. </p>
<p>Full disclosure, my primary source is Wikipedia greenhouse gas webpage, third paragraph under indirect radiative effects in particular. I am also an astrophysicist with a background in photon science.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few years since I did any climate change stuff, but from memory the issue with methane is that its peak absorption frequency for infra red is in a region where there is no absorption by CO2 - so it's an extra chunk of IR that is being trapped by the atmosphere; and that the peak absorption for methane is very strong - almost all the infrared of that frequency is trapped in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's also worth remembering the GWP is usually associated with a time-frame, so the warming potential for methane is something like 105 on a 20 year timeframe, but as the gas is oxidised to CO2 it falls to only 28 for a 100 year timeframe.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But great question - let's hope an expert rocks along soon!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
