<p>If you ever come across a trauma victim-</p>
<p>1- keep yourself safe, donâ€™t become another victim.</p>
<p>2- talk to the person, and make them spit out any gum, teeth, etc.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a natural end of life situation, the focus of care is generally around comfort. If talking is difficult, usually in the last few days, it makes little sense to be encouraging someone to keep talking.
As someone has already mentioned, in emergency situations we know that someone can breathe if they are talking, so a lot of effort goes into keeping the person awake and alert in an attempt to keep the airway open. Once the airway is lost you have a lot of other problems to deal with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Talking was too much and we often told her it was ok not to. She wanted to talk but it was hard.  We asked yes or no questions for her to nod too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's also not just about the physicality, but the mental aspects of dying too. In the last few moments, often people are trying very hard to say things they wanted to say but couldn't; regrets, apologies, last &quot;I love you&quot;s. Sometimes it's about the living person reasssuring the dying that they don't need to say these things, their love is known, their apologies unnecessary, nothing to regret. It can be about trying to give them mental peace and reassurance at the end too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
