I would imagine some stick around for a long time &amp; some disappear as soon as a particular astronaut leaves.</p>
<p>Is the air and dust in the ISS just as alive and diverse as on earth? If you took all the people out of the ISS what would the ecosystem look like? If you left food out would one or two strains ultimately dominate or would there be constant flux?</p>
<p>I'm just curious about what microflora might do on a spaceship. Is every nook and cranny going to be overgrown with fungus after 10 years? I'd love to hear any speculation, wild or not.</p>
<p>Thanks askscience</p></div></div>

The little known secret is that microbially speaking, it's a very dirty place, with fungal and bacterial outbreaks cropping up every now and then. When I spoke to them, they had not conducted any environmental microbial sequencing - they where looking for proposals and funding. So other than a couple of studies listed by other posters, we know that there are complex microbial systems, but they are not well characterized. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>EDIT: Found the paper I describe below -- <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2832349/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2832349/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2832349/</a></a></p>
<p>Going to space also makes bacteria much more resistant to antibiotics. I'm guessing that has something to do with gravity as well, with antibiotics ending up &quot;walled in&quot; by clumps of dead cells that then don't wash away as they would in an earth environment.</p>
<p>---End Edit</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Can't find the exact paper, but in addition to those articles, bacteria that had been to space was found to be more aggressive, more virulent, and more deadly than it's earthly equivalent. It also spreads much more quickly, because a bacterial colony can easily grow in 3D without having to deal with gravity. The samples maintained their increased virulence for some time after returning to earth.</p>
<p>Based on my own logic, I would assume that space-bacteria colonies would have issues with waste elimination (no gravity to make it flow away), but I am not certain that this would be a big issue for bacteria. It might be that they grow those column-and-canopy (described in the first link) structures specifically for waste management reasons. Bacteria are, after all, simpler than humans.</p>
<p>By the way, speaking of waste management, one of the first things discovered in space was that the feeling of needing to go to the bathroom requires gravity. I read an interview with a (recent) astronaut, I wanna say the guy that posts youtube videos playing guitar from the ISS, who described &quot;an odd bloating sensation a few days after arrival, which I soon deduced was the result of me not going to the bathroom for some time&quot; as there was no gravity to make the poop push against the inside of his butt and trigger the &quot;I wanna go&quot; feeling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I actually just finished a internship at NASA Ames studying the microbiome of space. I worked at GeneLab, which is making the data from NASA sequencing experiments available to the public. If your interested you can find the raw data at <a href="https://www.genelab.com" target="_blank">www.genelab.com</a> in the data repository, And if your adventurous GeneLab has a Galaxy server with all processed data and the workflows we used to process the data. You could even take the processed BIOM files in galaxy from say, GLDS-126: Analysis of dust samples from the Russian part of the ISS, and put them in phinch web veiwer and look at all the taxa that make up the microbiome of the ISS. Also check out papers published by Kasthuri Venkateswaran, he does the majority of the microbiome research of the ISS</p>
<p>One of the more interesting datasets I worked on was GLDS-69, which was a time series of location across the ISS. I noticed that between the timepoints there were major disruptions the the microbiome of the ISS. The majority of microbes were being displaced within two months, entire phylums were disappearing and being replaced, think snails replacing rabbits. While the microbiome of the ISS isn't stable its hard to say why. NASA doesn't collect the microbiome of the astronauts, so we don't know whats going up. I have hear antidotaly that there is a signature of the microbiome of Florida swamps on the ISS. And I have seen that the microbiome the ISS has a profile that is a mixture of microbiomes that associate with humans, plants, mice, and food.  All four of which are primarily the major sources of energy rich carbon and other macronutrients for microbes on the ISS.</p>
<p>I think if you left food out it would be primarily dominated by one genus, more so than it would be on earth. One if the interesting sampling locations was the dinning table of the ISS. Which when under some of the most radical changes in microbiome. Presumably because it is cleaned often and the microbiome of the food the astronauts eat repopulates it.  I'll actually bet a astronaut ate rice around the 5th of May, 2015, because 43% of the bacteria on the table were Bacillus cereus, which is common in leftover rice.  Also, watch a video of the dinner prep in zero g,  food is floating around everywhere.</p>
<p>There is fungus on the ISS, there even has been problems with some of the plants being infected with fungus. I imagine alot of the fungus we have down here has hitched a ride up, and just waiting for its opportunity. I also saw metal reducing bacteria, that might cause biocorroision to the metal of the ISS.  </p>
