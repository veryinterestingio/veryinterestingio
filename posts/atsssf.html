		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few reasons. Medicines for mood generally (all that I know of, but I'm not licensed, just mentally ill, so) work by increasing some of the chemicals your brain uses to talk to itself. This starts right away, but it can take a while for the levels to get to normal numbers. Also, when you have the wrong levels of chemicals, you start thinking thoughts that aren't true, and they hurt you. The more you think these thoughts, the easier it becomes to think them, and the faster you can do it. It becomes a habit, like brushing your teeth. Because you do not have the normal chemicals for your brain, it is really hard to break that habit - you usually feel bad, and the thoughts make you feel worse, but because you felt bad already it can be really hard to think good thoughts. So even though the chemicals are usually at normal levels before you feel all of the effects for them, it takes a while for you to learn to think good thoughts. The good news is that any kind of thought can be a habit - so if you notice yourself starting to think bad thoughts again, you can redirect yourself to the good thoughts instead, and the more you think them, the easier and faster they will be. The thoughts and medicine work together so you can be healthy.</p>
<p>(Scishow actually has a great video on this on YouTube btw, and they do a great job of breaking things down to a layperson level, fact checking, and correcting themselves, historically, so I definitely recommend them! They talk a bit fast, so you might have to slow the video down slightly, but YouTube actually has that built in, and I would be more than happy to explain how if anyone needs it.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the case of antidepressants, it's because their mechanism of action is neurogenesis in the hippocampus. This process takes roughly two weeks to have an effect on serotonin levels.  </p>
<p>The fact that antidepressants act via hippocampal neurogenesis is relatively recently discovered by science - within about the last ten years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is stuff in your brain called serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine (neurotransmitters). Depressed people often have too little of this, or the stuff is weirdly distributed where it's sometimes too high and sometimes too low.</p>
<p>There are a few categories of antidepressants but the ones you are taking about are blocking the destruction of the stuff or improve the re-use. This will slowly raise the equilibrium, to a higher yet steady level.</p>
<p>Drugs usually force the body to directly create the neurotransmitters which will make you feel happy in as little as a minute. But this will further shorten the shortage of neurotransmitters in the future.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for asking this, OP. I’m making my first foray into the world of SSRIs and although I generally feel fine so far, I get really touchy/super sensitive in the morning, usually a couple of hours after I’ve taken half a tablet (just in time for work!) In the afternoon I feel much more even-keeled. Hoping it’s not too long before I get that feeling all day. Cheers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have to go through the placebo 'wow, it's working straight away' phase,</p>
<p>the 'ohhhh, maybe I just imagined that' phase,</p>
<p>the authentic blink and you miss it, working-but-subtly phase (day 7),</p>
<p>before giving up hope (day 14) and then</p>
<p>sort of adjusting to the fact that I do feel a little numb I guess plus I've got side-effects so  they might be working now but really I just can't remember how I felt before I had the side effects,</p>
<p>then you forget to remember to ask if they are working,</p>
<p>and now they are working (week 3)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
