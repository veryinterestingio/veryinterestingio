		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wind is caused by the difference in air pressure in different places. Warm air is less dense than cold air, so it wants to rise up and cold air wants to fall down. Cold air will push warm air out of the way, typically upwards where the warm air will be pushed away, cool down, and fall down elsewhere to continue the cycle.</p>
<p>Those different air temperatures pushing each other around is wind.</p>
<p>During the day, the Sun is warming the ground, which is warming the air. Air doesn't absorb visible light very well - obviously, that's why you can see through it. At night, the Sun...isn't. So there isn't as much energy warming the air. There is less of a difference between the warm air and the cold air, which is why there is less wind at night <em>generally speaking</em>.</p>
<p>Also, if it's been windy all day that means the air has been mixing and moving and shoving other air out of the way <em>all day</em>. That particular weather front may have simply pushed the other front out of the way already and there's not much left until the next one moves in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends where you live.  Near the ocean or a large body of water, you will get a diurnal sea breeze.  Imagine being at the beach on a hot sunny day.  The sand gets blistering hot but the ocean stays cold.  The air directly above the sand is heated and rises while the air over the ocean cools and sinks. This creates a giant engine (a convective cell) where the air goes up from the beach, out over the ocean, down to the surface of the ocean then back to the beach.  It is the last part that you feel as the sea breeze.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Meteorologist here: most of these answers are missing the point for one reason or another. For most of the planet, most days, you get what's called an inversion (a shallow layer of air warmer than the air above and below it) at or just after sunset. This is when the air a couple hundred feet above the surface is warmer than the air right at the surface, because the ground (no longer heated by the sun) cools quicker than the air above it, and when it cools the heat emitted is absorbed by that air and rises slightly. This forms what we sometimes call a 'cap' that keeps higher winds aloft from mixing down to the surface.</p>
<p>For lots of reasons that don't really fit into an ELI5, this doesn't happen every day everywhere, but it's common enough that we just call it the 'nocturnal inversion' and that's all the forecast reasoning necessary for why the winds drop overnight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
