		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is an actual reason that I don't see here but I'm late to the party!</p>
<p>As people have said previously, hairs grow from follicles, inside your skin. Some do indeed grow forever, like your head hair (if you're lucky.) They age and fall out due to a lot of different reasons including what you eat and how healthy you are.</p>
<p>Hairs that don't grow forever get their length determined in the genes of the cells in the follicle. But how do they sense their length?</p>
<p>Longer hairs wiggle! Cells in the follicle can sense mechanical stress as well as grow hairs.</p>
<p>Say we talk about a hair in your leg, just above your ankle.  As it grows, moving in life causes it to wiggle a certain amount. Just a little bit at first.  Then as it gets longer it's more likely to catch air currents,  rub on things,  and get pulled more.  The follicle knows how much wiggle is associated with how long the hair is. If it wiggles just a little it'll hang on to the hair.  If it wiggles to much it stops growing the hair and may even let it go after a certain amount of time.</p>
<p>Incidentally you can see this work,  especially around the ankle when people wear socks for a long time. The constant movement of the sock on the ankle can sometimes make hair growth finer or even stop it entirely.  This happens in athletes.  Now on the other side of the spectrum,  people that wear socks for to long but don't move, say when they're in a coma, usually grow very long ankle hairs because there is no wiggle.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> TLDR at the bottom. I am so excited to see all the interest in my answer for why we have funny hairs! I came back to see a number of comments expanding upon my explanation, but also some that rightfully sought further explanation, hopefully with evidence based research. After about 10 hours of intensive investigation (this covid thing has done weird things to me) I've come up with a couple points that may or may not be of interest. I thought I'd break it into different contents.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>As a Human Journey:</strong> I swear to God I thought I had it right. I was honestly surprised that I didn't see the obvious only right answer posted here. I <em>knew</em> I learned about this in histology. Absolutely <em>knew</em> without any doubt at all. As a result I wrote it up without second guessing. I didn't include sources and didn't double check anything afterwards. Everyone, be careful what you think you <em>know</em>. I'm a pretty educated person but I'm not always right. The worst is embarking on a 10 hour research quest through available literature to <em>make</em> myself right. At the very least I was hoping I'd be able to absolve myself of totally making something up. I still don't really know if I did but suffice to say I can't find where I came up with this explanation as I described it. I swear I've know the &quot;wiggle&quot; explanation for years. Weird, but okay.  <em>Mea culpa</em> for sure. Bs can happen to (or be made up by) the best of us. Lastly, I absolutely loved hearing all the anecdotes and appreciate the interest in just a ELI5. I'm so glad I learned about people's watches, toes, wizard eyebrows, and pooping habits.</li>
<li><strong>As a Scientist:</strong> Always include sources where you are able, especially if you endeavor to teach others. u/Darthskull and u/marklein had exactly the right idea. That being said, no one who believed my explanation at face value should feel like a bad scientist. It's still a kick ass explanation that appears to have testable effects. It is a pretty neat hypothesis for sure. Buuuuuut I guess it hasn't been tested specifically. I'll get to that below. Early moral is to be careful quickly accepting explanations that sound like the right answer immediately. Late lesson is again that I went searching in order to prove my hypothesis correct when I was called on it. That is so, so dangerous in science. We cannot look for articles and information that tell us what we want to hear. This applies in every aspect of life but especially in science.  Find your data, interpret it, then decide what you think. Any other order carries with it the potential for misunderstanding, bias, and concerning inaccuracies. After albeit too much research, the last moral may turn out to be that not all BS is worthless. Some of the best ideas come from the nugget of <del>corn</del> truth yielded by BS. I do think there is potential for actual honest to God real scientific testing.</li>
<li><strong>As a Brand New Hair Researcher:</strong> (This is decidedly <strong>not</strong> ELI5 and requires some pretty good foundational biochem. Also a good handle of other top answers.) Many of the other answers in this thread have indicated or hinted at where the current body of research regarding hair growth has brought us. Hair growth science is of particular interest to experts in evolutionary biology, pharmaceuticals, and nearly every field of medicine, from dermatology to oncology. That being said there is a huge amount that is not known. I think I still might be wrong, but there's a chance in all that vague &quot;black box&quot; process &quot;wiggle theory&quot; might come out okay.</li>
</ol>
<p>As many have stated (and copy and pasted [only throwing gentle shade]), the most generally accepted and well tested explanation for OP's original question entails a temporally limited cell cycling within the follicle. Anagen, Catagen, and Telogen have been measured numerous times in both in vitro and in vivo models. They appear relatively stable within individual follicles. The length of these cycles and, by extension, the general growth of the hair can be altered appropriately based upon physiologic need at initial cell line differentiation. These are frequently geographic distributions. These basic blueprints would be subject to varying biochemical marker gradients and gene expression.  <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S108700241530294X" target="_blank">Hair Cycle Clock</a>. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470434/" target="_blank">Follicular Cell Cycling</a></p>
<p>Both hormonal regulation as well as localized gene expression can alter the length of the anagen stage in particular. Otherwise, these stages progress rather autonomously with or without extrinsic stimuli. From what we can tell, differing hair types, and likely their maximum lengths become set. As we age or undergo stress, there can be measurable and dramatic changes in the cycling time but there isn't an indication that there is significant plasticity due to extrinsic stimuli on the follicle itself. MAYBE.</p>
<p>So many aspects of localized cellular behaviors are dictated by biochemical milieu and equilibrium it would be nigh impossible to exclude cytokine and chemotactic processes from affecting follicles. The oft attributed TNF, TGF, and FGF may play a large role in actually causing cycling but, hell, they play a large role in a lot of things. What can be said is that at some point anagen activation must outweigh inhibitory mechanisms lest catagen begin and the follicle begins to atrophy.</p>
<p>We don't know what stimuli could cause increases in localized biochemical inhibitors. Some may prove to be tactile in nature, but it has not been characterized as of yet. Could repeated abrasion from a sock, or continued tensile stress influence follicular cell cycling? Could be. This would have to be distinctly different than previously characterized pathology (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470434/" target="_blank">traction allopecia</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4606321/" target="_blank">Stress induced hair loss</a>, etc). This would have to be physiology! This would be characterized as extrafollicular skin signalling. There is obvious indication that this does exist but again seems to affect larger regions or groups of follicles rather than individual follicles. Again, there does not appear to be an intrafollicular process for this known at this time.</p>

<p>TLDR: I accidentally thought this was an easy question that I could easily answer, and did. Turns out everyone was right to question my answer despite other seemingly promising anecdotal applications and ostensibly sound reasoning. I didn't have the data or the research to back it up. I researched for 10 hours through primary literature review in an effort to find out where I came up with it and maybe to make me right. Probably am not right but learned a lot about hair. The other answers represent the most widely accepted explanations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Asked and answered in 2015: Actually, all hair stops growing after a certain length! Leg hair, arm hair, eyelashes, eyebrows, head hair, and even the hair on your butt will stop growing after a certain period of time. Exactly how long your hair can grow depends primarily on your genetics, but age, hormones, and general health can all play a part.</p>
<p>Hair growth occurs in three phases. The first phase is called the anagen phase and it is during this time that the hair actually grows. About 85% of the hair on your head is in this phase at any given time. This phase can last between two and six years for head hair and the duration of this phase will determine just how fast and how long your hair can grow.</p>
<p>The second phase is the catagen phase. During this phase, the hair follicle separates from the hair strand itself and does some things to prepare itself for the next phase.</p>
<p>The third phase is called the telogen phase and it's known as the resting phase. Around 15% of your hairs will be in this phase at any given moment. Once this phase is over, the cycle begins anew with the anagen phase.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_hair_growth" target="_blank">You can read more about Human hair growth at Wikipedia.</a> Take a look at the sidebar for information about the different kinds of hair, too!</p>
<p>It has been five years since I've had my head hair last cut and it's stopped growing about mid-way down my back. That's a pretty typical length for males. Female hair tends to stop somewhere around the buttocks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
