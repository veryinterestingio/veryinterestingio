		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple factors at play. The one that no one thinks about but has been proven, buildings trap a lot of carbon dioxide. I know it seems obvious, but the amount they trap is surprising. Often times throughout the day the levels of carbon dioxide will rise to the point that medical proffesionals determine cause headaches, irritability, and slight impairment of cognitive ability.</p>
<p>That's not to say all buildings are like that, and some are worse than others. However the data supports it. More CO2 means less oxygen and more work per breath. So when you step outside your lungs have instant relief.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All of the reasons mentioned are good, but also consider that it's not the fresh air, it's the sunlight. Humans need sunlight or they will literally be unhappy without it, so the satisfying feeling you get from being outside could likely be that you're soaking up some rays</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can be for several reasons. If you were stuck inside working or at school all day then when you go outside you know it's finally over. Another reason could be because after so long inside of the same place the air inside can get stuffy from being recycled all day, as well as being trapped inside with certain smells and dust/dander.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
