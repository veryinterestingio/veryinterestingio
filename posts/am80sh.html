		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, there are many different things that can cause these games to not work.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>First of all, when your game is trying to work on a newer system, it was equipped with a map of the older hardware, this allows the game to find all of the different pieces inside your console to run, whether it be memory, processors, video processors or even where the controllers are. When newer consoles come out, the map changes, and it was programmed on the older maps. Your program doesn't know where anything is. It gets lost and feels scared.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Next, older consoles may have had only a single processor. Think of it like a little person doing things inside your console. Newer consoles have more little people working inside of them. Older games, if they sent out a person to go do jobs, the jobs always came back in the order they got sent out, because there was only the one guy. Newer consoles have more people, so sometimes, the jobs come back in a different order and the game doesn't know what to do with the completed job. It is used to only getting one thing back at a time. This can make your game have a panic attack and shut down.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also, there are other programs that are on your console that also do work and help your game work. Think of them less like little people and more like the school you go to. These programs are filled with rules, whether its handling how your game looks, or what buttons do when they are pressed, or what sounds are supposed to play. Just like your school, these programs have rules. Your game was written on the old rules, and doesn't know what the new ones are. It may try to do something it thinks is fine and a hall monitor pops up and yells, &quot;You can't do that here!&quot; Or, maybe your game is allowed to do something that would make it's day easier, but doesn't know that it's not against the rules.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for all the appreciation and gildings!. A couple of things:</p>
<p>I am not a programmer as a job. I had to drop out of college when I ran out of money. I wanted to work on video games, but it didn't pan out. My wife (who is much smarter than me) helped write the post. I am a locksmith. Also, there are apparently some caveats on weird wordings that didn't come across quite right, but others have responded below with far more technological information that I have. I encourage you to look through the responses, they are quite good. We tried our best for an ELI5, so the metaphors are imprecise. When I told my wife the prompt and what I was going with, she gave me an exasperated look and said, &quot;Oh my god, so much.&quot; Apparently it can be really hard, but some programs are written to not utilize the hardware in weird and quirky ways are much easier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Each gen of a console may have very unique hardware tied together in a very specific way with unique capabilities that help it perform as fast as possible. The way the components work together may be very tightly coupled, and the code the games run may be so optimized that e.g. the time it takes for some routine on the graphics chip to complete might be highly interdependent on the CPU getting some other task done fast enough to even run a game stable.</p>
<p>The new gen might be called e.g. the PS4, but inside the hardware is nothing like the PS3 at all. To make the older code run on the new hardware, the newer device has to intercept everything the old code thinks it's doing on the old hardware and make it work on the new hardware instead, with no discrepancies in behavior. This is called emulation. That's usually very hard to do and the emulator code itself takes time to process too.</p>
<p>The result is that unless the new hardware actually contains a lot of same the chips that the older hardware also had, or the manufacturer abstracted away the functionality behind an easily re-implememted API (like DirectX), you need a much, much faster processor to have any chance of emulating the old system fast enough to make it perform well.</p>
<p>Especially in older generation devices, before the likes of XBox with it's more standardized directx-like API, coders used to write code that talked to hardware directly. It means emulators have to interrupt almost everything that code does and pretend to do the same thing on the newer hardware.</p>
<p>Imagine writing an emulator: Your program has to read hundreds of thousands of instructions per second, transform them into instructions that can be understood by the new hardware, translate instructions for the video and audio and I/O chips, keep all their work in sync like on the original system even though the performance of the new hardware is totally different, and do it all fast enough to keep everything running in real-time as far as the user can tell.</p>
<p>Even today there are still devices from 25 years ago (like Amiga) that still don't have perfect emulation and where code still runs better on a 7Mhz original device than a 2Ghz PC running an emulator.</p>
<p>The performance cost of emulation can be so great that some consoles that can run games from older generation systems go as far as including most of the older generation hardware to be able to do it. For example, older PS3's have chips in them that are compatible with ones from the PS2 and can play PS2 games. Newer model PS3's don't, and can't.</p>
<p>tl;dr: Your PS3 makes beef burgers. Your PS4 is vegan. These are not compatible. It takes a lot more work for your PS4 to make a vegan burger passable as beef.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they were reinventing the wheel with every generation of console instead of using a standardized architecture.</p>
<p>If we're talking about PlayStation, CPU and GPU in every console before PS4 had different architectures, they weren't using standard &quot;computer&quot; x86-64 architecture that can run any standard computer program, so this is why they can't just run games written for older console on a new one. They can emulate older CPU inside a more powerful CPU, but this a silly exercise to begin with.</p>
<p>Now you know why standards are a good thing.</p>
<p>The situation is better nowadays, PS5 will have backward compatibility with PS4 games (just as PS4 Pro does with PS4) because they will use a CPU and GPU based on the same standard architecture in it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's usually not cost effective. There's usually a tradeoff between having the highest possible performance and being compatible with your previous generation's hardware. You are often compromising your performance by sticking to your previous architecture, than switching to whatever is top of the line at the moment.</p>
<p>The Wii was the same architecture as the Gamecube, at the cost of the console's performance.</p>
<p>The PS3 used a different architecture than the PS2/PS1, so it couldn't natively support PS2 games. So Sony put the additional hardware of a PS2 inside the PS3 to enable reverse compatibility, which was expensive. That's why the first generation PS3 was $600 and they took out reverse compatibility for the price reduction model.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
