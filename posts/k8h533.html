That is my understanding at least. Or say Hepatitis B, 3 doses and then you're done.</p>
<p>But tetanus? Needs a boost every 5-10 years... why? Influenza I can dig because it mutates, but I don't get tetanus. Is it to do with the type of vaccine? Is it the immune response/antibodies that somehow have an expiry date? And some don't? Why are some antibodies short-lived like milk, and others are infinite like Twinkies?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tetanus is actually interesting because the reason you need boosters every 10 years is actually because the studies done show that it is effective up to ten years and they didn’t do longer studies. For all we know the vaccine lasts a lifetime but it wasn’t tested so we don’t know that. The reason for why they didn’t do the study is obscure. Maybe there’s just no incentive since the boosters don’t hurt and drug companies make money. Maybe it’s hard to change guidelines due to bureaucracy. Who knows. You should still get the boosters if you get a puncture wound though because again, we don’t know how long the vaccine lasts. </p>
<p>Looking this up again for the first time in awhile I’m finding this study that says it probably actually lasts at least 30 years. </p>
<p>Edit: link to study was broken. Here is article link instead: <a href="https://news.ohsu.edu/2016/03/22/study-shows-tetanus-shots-needed-every-30-years-not-every-10" target="_blank">https://news.ohsu.edu/2016/03/22/study-shows-tetanus-shots-needed-every-30-years-not-every-10</a></p>
<p>Edit: Obligatory thanks for the awards! Glad I could point out one of the little funny idiosyncrasies of our scientific world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Immunology is a complicated topic. Your main source of viral immunity isn't really antibodies. They are just the easiest thing to measure. Antibodies are more for fighting off infections. Cells are created to generate the new antibodies, and eventually die off. For viruses, T cell immunity is a huge factor. Your body gets trained to hunt down and destroy its own cells when they are infected before they have a chance to propogate. This t cell immunity lasts for your life usually. It's why people can be immune to small pox or chicken pox for most/all of their life. </p>
<p>In the case of Tetanus, the shot is actually good for much longer than 10 years for most people, but 10 is a safe number where nearly everyone will be adequately protected. You actually develop a resistance to the tetanoid toxin produced with the shot. Bacteria and toxins aren't affected the same way by t cell immunity and require antibodies to suppress. These antibodies drop off much faster and therefore require boosters more often. For example, Typhoid fever vaccinations are only good for about 5 years or so. Even then, they are nowhere near 100%. While you never will need another hepatitis A or Measles vaccination.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's odd, but I took two immunology classes and they never really explained this either. As I understand it, your body does make &quot;memory cells&quot; that remember immunity, but for some reason, some of them die off over time when you are not re-exposed to the pathogen. </p>
<p>tl;dr it's kind of a medical mystery, but there are several possible reasons, including the type of antigen that initiated the immune response, possible re-infections throughout your life, and other factors.</p>
<p>Here is an article on LiveScience that goes into it a bit: <a href="https://www.livescience.com/why-lifelong-immunity.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.livescience.com/why-lifelong-immunity.html" target="_blank">https://www.livescience.com/why-lifelong-immunity.html</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the reasons is the different types of vaccines.  That is, live attenuated pathogen based vaccines - e.g. MMR, smallpox, yellow fever - tend to give the strongest immune response and therefore longest lasting (sometimes lifelong) immunity.  Other types of vaccines, whether inactivated pathogen-based (e.g. current Hep A, typhoid and cholera vaccines), subunit (e.g. HPV, HIb, N. meningitis, and S.pneumonia vaccines), or toxoid (tetanus and diphtheria vaccines) don't typically induce such a strong immune response and therefore boosters are required.</p>
<p>As for what mechanism governs the duration of antibodies, as well as memory B and T cells, afraid I don't know that in detail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tetanus is caused by the toxin released by a bacteria that grows particularly well in puncture wounds. The vaccine is a &quot;toxoid&quot; vaccine, which delivers an inactivated version of this toxin to develop an immune response. After receiving the full schedule of tetanus vaccine, most people would not develop tetanus. However, if an adult gets a puncture wound and it's been a while since their last tetanus shot, a booster is insurance in case they are among the few whose immunity fades over time. And while boosters aren't routinely administered every ten years, they are highly recommended for people travelling to remote areas where getting a booster after an injury may be challenging.</p>
<p>Big picture: imagine that getting the disease or getting the immunization colonizes you with little immune response warriors. With some diseases, the little immune response warriors get bored, lazy, or just go away if they don't get to fight a battle. A booster gives them a little something to do, and keeps them in the fight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
