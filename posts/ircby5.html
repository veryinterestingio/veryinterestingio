		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before we could use satellites to take pictures from space, if we wanted to see what was going on in enemy territory, we had to take pictures from a plane.</p>
<p>Enemies didn't want us taking pictures so they would try to stop the plane - usually by blowing it up with missiles.</p>
<p>We didn't have &quot;stealth&quot; technology yet to keep from being seen, so if we wanted to avoid getting hit with missiles, we needed a way to avoid them. The best way we could come up with was to go so fast they couldn't catch up.</p>
<p>Being really high in the air helped this, because it's easier to go fast up high, and because it would take missiles so long to get up to you, you could be out of the area before they reached that height.</p>
<p>As a result, the SR-71 was designed to go as high and as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Since then, we learned to build space satellites to take our pictures, which can't be hit with missiles. We also developed &quot;stealth&quot; technology for planes, which keeps them from being seen on radar. This means we no longer need to develop planes for high and fast work, so the SR-71 remains the best at that.</p>
<p>(Edited to remove error related to a missile strike)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The SR-71 could evade air defenses with raw speed and altitude.  Air defenses have improved to the point where it would take a truly revolutionary leap to make an airplanes that could use its speed and altitude to do so.  Couple that with satellites and stealth and the cost/benefit/practicality doesn’t make sense.  </p>
<p>At least on paper.  Who knows what remains classified.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the “why hasn’t something faster been built”: </p>
<p>There’s no need for anything as fast or faster. Flying at M3.2 requires Ramjet engines, custom fuel that won’t spontaneously ignite when the aircraft gets hot and a shit ton of maintenance time on the ground. </p>
<p>Theoretically, a Ramjet engine is good up to Mach 5 at which point the intake temperature exceeds the working temp of all known materials. The SR-71 showed that even getting 2/3 of the way there requires buckets of money, R&amp;D and maintenance, so we’re pretty much at the limits of that technology.</p>
<p>The next step up requires a new generation of engines, either a Scramjet (Supersonic Combustion Ramjet) being developed by NASA on the X43-A) or the Sabre engine being developed by a British company. Shit like this takes a looooong time to develop and test, when I was studying aerospace engineering in the late 80s I wrote a paper on the design and development of both engines. They’ve only started testing them in the last few years!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
