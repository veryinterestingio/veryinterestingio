		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That’s not quite what the article (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6" target="_blank">Clinical and immunological assessment of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections</a>) said. It found that people who had been <em>asymptomatically infected</em> lost antibodies more quickly than those who showed symptoms. Importantly (and this will certainly be lost in the media reports) the majority of both groups (60% and ~90%) still had detectable antibodies at the 8 week mark. </p>
<p>First, there are several odd things about this article that make me a little skeptical. For one thing, this study also saw a drop in antibodies 8 weeks after symptomatic infection, whereas several larger studies have tracked symptomatic patients for at least this long and seen no such drop. For example, in <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.07.20124636v2" target="_blank">Dynamics of IgG seroconversion and pathophysiology of COVID-19 infections</a>: “<em>Antibody responses do not decline during follow up almost to 2 months</em>”.  And “<em>In our survey, we did not find evidence for a decrease in IgG antibody titer levels on repeat sampling.</em>” (<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.30.20085613v1.full.pdf+html" target="_blank">Humoral immune response and prolonged PCR positivity in a cohort of 1343 SARS-CoV 2 patients in the New York City region</a>). </p>
<p>So those two studies, looking at nearly 500 patients, find no evidence for antibody decline, while this study, with just 37 patients, does find evidence. We can’t ignore it, but we can discount it and wait for more evidence. </p>
<p>Still, it’s entirely plausible that asymptomatic patients would have a weaker and less durable response than symptomatic. Inflammation drives immunity, so a less inflammatory disease would be expected to drive a less durable response. Again, we need to wait for larger, longer-lasting studies. </p>
<p>Is this typical of antibodies? Yes and no. Antibodies do fade away rapidly in the blood.  But with many, if not most, infections, new antibodies continue to be produced for months or years after the initial infection. That is, the B cells that produce the antibodies don’t immediately shut down or die, but keep on making more antibody, so that in many infections you can see antibodies present for a long time afterward. </p>
<p>With SARS and MERs, the closest cousins to SARS-CoV-2, the antibody response lasts for a reasonable but not extraordinary time. SARS antibodies have been shown to last for several years, with between 2 and 3 years being the most common claim (<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc070348?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed" target="_blank">Disappearance of Antibodies to SARS-Associated Coronavirus after Recovery</a>) although one recent preprint claims “<em>IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV can persist for at least 12 years</em>” (<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20021386v1.full.pdf" target="_blank">Long-Term Persistence of IgG Antibodies in SARS-CoV Infected Healthcare Workers</a>). </p>
<p>MERS antibodies might last a little shorter, but that’s mainly because MERS patients haven’t been followed for as long, so a study that follows patients for a year can only claim “<em>Robust antibody responses were detected in all survivors who had severe disease; responses remained detectable, albeit with some waning, for &lt;1 year.</em>” (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5512479/" target="_blank">MERS-CoV Antibody Responses 1 Year after Symptom Onset, South Korea, 2015</a>). </p>
<p>So (1) several studies find that SARS-CoV-2 antibodies stick around for a couple of months without fading, (2) SARS and MERS antibodies stick around for a year or three, but (3) one small study claims that asymptomatic patients have short-lived antibodies. This seems like a good time to say that more research is needed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's common for them to drop off. Some antibodies stick around for quite some time though as your body makes them constantly. You can measure this, and it's often done to prove that someone was vaccinated if they've lost their vaccination records.</p>
<p>Even if you don't have antibodies around, you often can quickly make them upon re-infection. Around 15-20% of people in this study never made detectable antibodies in the first place, and they all were alive 8 weeks later showing that you can get better even without antibodies detectable by this test.</p>
<p>Keep in mind the numbers they quote. They say that the rate of neutralizing antibodies--the ones that work--only drop around 10% (although there are serious issues as how they determined that). The 70% number is also misleading because the antibodies are measured on a logarithmic scale. For example, one patient dropped from 100 million to 10 million. This seems like a lot, but someone not exposed has a level of 1.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh cool, a subject I know something about!</p>
<p>The answer is no, not all antibodies drop off quickly, and if we knew why it could be super helpful for designing vaccines against some diseases like malaria, which requires persistent high levels of antibodies to remain immune. </p>
<p>If you get infected with some live viruses like mumps or rubella, your antibody levels hardly drop at all. Mathematical modelling shows them to have a half life of 100s of years. In comparison, tetanus vaccine, which is just a protein made by the virus rather than a whole virus, gives you antibody levels that halve every 10 years or so. Some are even shorter. </p>
<p>It seems to be a complex interplay between a few different factors. Some pathogens may have bits that hang around in your body for well after the infection has finished, constantly stimulating you to produce new antibodies and so keeping levels high (so called antigen persistence). Other pathogens perhaps stimulate the production of long lived plasma cells (LLPCs). LLPCs are antibody producing cells which hang around in your bone marrow, pumping out specific antibodies for decades. </p>
<p>In contrast, some pathogens only result in short lived plasma cells. SLPCs only make antibodies for a short period of time, before disappearing, along with your antibody concentrations. But the response might also leave behind so called memory B cells, so even though your antibody levels are low, if you meet the same pathogen again, these memory B cells quickly cause more of the antibody to be made to fight it off, before levels drop again. </p>
<p>The thing is, for some diseases, you probably don't need high levels of antibodies all the time. You can beat the infection by ramping up production when it first takes hold before it becomes established. However, diseases like malaria seen to require you to have high levels on standby, because the parasite quickly multiplies if not controlled, and making more takes too long. This is seen with the efficacy of the RTS,S malaria vaccine - it initially gives high levels of antibodies and good protection, but the antibodies quickly drop off and the protection with it. If we could figure out how to make them last, that would be great. </p>
<p>A nice paper that describes some of these differences is in the NEJM <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa066092" target="_blank">here</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my experience, this isn't atypical. There are several key concepts here. Each individual antibody has a half-life on the order of weeks. So individual antibodies will be degraded by your body but the plasma cells that were activated will produce more so your titers will remain overall stable. However, even the plasma cells can become dormant/die so that immunity can wane over time - fewer antibodies will be produced. This is likely what's happening here, although the study sample was small so it needs to be taken with a grain of salt. </p>
<p>The other key concept is that in the adaptive immune response, you also form memory B cells that, upon re-challenge with the antigen, can differentiate into plasma cells and start mass-producing antibodies again. This is the key part that the study does not look at and will be key for sustained immunity if the study findings are to be believed.</p>
<p>Now, it's not uncommon for antibody titers to go down over time. If I checked your titers for measles, mumps, rubella, Hep B, etc. it is likely that one or more of those may have decreased below accepted thresholds. However, this does not mean that you're not immune. It just means that your body has decided it no longer needs to produce antibodies to these pathogens but memory cells may still persist. So then when we give a booster, we do see a massive response, indicating that your immune system remembers and if you were challenged with the actual pathogen, you'd see a similarly large immune response from the memory cells despite not having high titers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Protein half life for antibodies (lets say I label the antibodies with something and just inject them into you) is about 28 days.  So this would imply essentially zero production of antibodies post-infection and that it is just the existing antibodies decaying down resulting in the drop in ab levels.</p>
<p>of course, your B cells that made the antibodies might just be hanging out waiting for re-exposure and a chance to make a shitton of antibodies in the face of a new infection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
