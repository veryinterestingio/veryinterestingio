<p>I always assumed this was for monetary exploitation, and to not demolish the sales of the previous console on the pre-owned market.</p>
<p>But I'm also interested in knowing if there's an actual technical limitation behind this decision.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unlike PC games, console games can be really tightly integrated and optimized with the console hardware because the game authors know *exactly* what hardware they're going to run on. This is part of why a console can pull off more intensive games than a computer with equivalently powerful hardware.</p>
<p>But...this means that the game is written assuming all that hardware is available. The whole point of a new console is to give the developers new, more powerful, more capable hardware to write their games on. To make a PS4 game run on a PS5 you have to include an extra &quot;layer&quot; in the PS5 to translate for the PS4 game. The PS4 game doesn't know it's on a PS5 and it expects PS4 hardware; the PS5 needs to handle those requests and make the fact that it's a PS5 invisible to the PS4 game. This means, at bare minimum, a bunch of extra software to write &amp; test. If there was a format change or specific hardware functionality that isn't used at all on the PS5, you might also have to install the extra hardware (and related software to run it) just to support the PS4 game. </p>
<p>That's all doable but you have to do it as an explicit and intentional effort to run backwards compatible games, it can't just happen by accident.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answers so far kind of hit the point, but it's more than hardware, it's also software.</p>
<p>MS has worked hard to keep the basic engine used for all their Xboxes similar, which makes backwards compatibility simple, even with changing hardware.</p>
<p>Sony did not do this. With each new console, Sony utilized a different engine, which makes backwards compatible much more difficult.</p>
<p>The PS4 and PS5 supposedly are designed similarly, which makes backwards compatibility simpler, but the PS3, PS2 and PS1 are all different, which means sony either has to go with software emulation which is definitely resource intensive, or build in the hardware for the older console, much like the launch PS3s did for PS2 backwards compatibility.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The chipset changes from console to console. To support backwards compatibility often times the CPU in the machine no longer understands instructions the same way the last console did. </p>
<p>In these cases you need to add emulation to your console which require either additional hardware or development time. Both of which increase cost.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s why you frequently see compatibility only supported early in a consoles lifecycle and they often remove it later to reduce prices when the new console is more popular.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The PS5 should support all PS4 games in theory. But there are
roughly 2800 games for the PS4 on the market; it's simply
impossible to manually test each of them to make sure it also
runs on the PS5. So Sony just tried out the 100 most
popular titles and made sure they work well. So probably most
games will work out of the box, Sony just cannot guarantee it.</p>
<p>And while profits are of course a reason for missing
compatibility now and then there are also technical reasons; the
PS3 had a very unusual processor, making emulation very hard.
However, the PS4 and PS5 use the same architecture, just like
two different gaming PCs would, so the only thing that would
prevent compatibility between them is software.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unlike a PC, modern console hardware is very streamlined for the specific console. This allows them to actually get more processing power out of what is more or less the same equipment compared to a general purpose computer.</p>
<p>If they wanted the PS5 to support PS4 games, they would either have to have a second set of hardware in there to run PS4 games, as they have in the past with backwards compatibility, or to use Software Emulation to run a virtual PS4 on PS5 hardware. Software emulation has a huge performance penalty, so it isn't really feasible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
