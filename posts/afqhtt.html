		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m not a doctor, but I do work in healthcare. I rarely get sick, and I suspect it’s due to 2 things: 1) exposure/immunity 2) hand washing/masking/PPE. </p>
<p>Anecdotally, new employees tend to get sick more frequently, until they develop immunity to the <em>local</em> everyday sicknesses. </p>
<p>In healthcare, “safe practices” are drilled into our heads, so we’re less likely to be exposed to uncommon illnesses (that being said, I was recently tested for TB because I was exposed at work). For example, a family member is considerably more likely to catch c. Diff from an infected person than a healthcare worker is, because the healthcare worker is going to be wearing gloves and a disposable gown when in contact with the patient and will thoroughly wash their hands after having contact. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a hospital/critical care doctor.</p>
<p>I would say this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>we have high vaccination rates which is of course protective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>exposure to illnesses no doubt builds immunity. You can see this when people first start working in Paediatrics where there seems to be different strains of viruses prevalent, and they become unwell much more frequently. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We take a lot less sick leave than many other professions. But that doesn’t mean we don’t get sick. There is unspoken pressure to not call in sick unless you are on your deathbed (figuratively speaking), because patients don’t stop coming so your colleagues have to pick up any slack if the team is one person short. I remember having a sick day once and on return my boss half jokingly said he checked ICU when I was away and was surprised that I wasn’t admitted there.</p>
</li>
<li>it’s possible that we are a bit better at treating illnesses or symptoms early because we (a) know what to look for, and (b) have easier access to prescription remedies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally though, does anyone have data that shows Doctors don’t get sick less often? This may just be an urban myth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
