		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nasopharyngeal Swabs “Brain-Ticklers” are the go to because of the highest chance of getting a good quality specimen that can be tested and give reliable results.</p>
<p>If a Covid test needs to find 10 particles in a specimen to be called positive, you want to make sure that your specimen collection can deliver that if collected from a person that is positive.  Poor collection can make the test appear to be negative by not capturing enough virus.  </p>
<p>You are correct in that the virus is exhaled when you cough, but it’s really hard to capture air and then get it into a liquid state without a lot of effort, and most Covid tests require some form of liquid media to function.  In the case of swabs, all that I have worked with have been placed in transport media or buffer solution, taking everything that was on the swab and suspending it in a liquid that can then be tested.</p>
<p>There are some other Covid test systems that do allow for Spit or BAL specimens but they are more difficult to process.  In order to get as many people reliably tested as possible, the swab is path of least resistance even if it is really uncomfortable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>PCR based assays are very susceptible to contamination, which is the current testing methodology. </p>
<p>Viral transport media where the swabs are stored contain antibiotics and fungicides to kill off any bacteria and fungi to maintain the viability of the virus. </p>
<p>Also no specimen processor wants a lunch bag full of your spit lol</p>
<p>I haven’t done a COVID test but I’ve used some of the commercially available PCR tests for other viruses. Swabs are vortexed in reagent so I think the difficulty of applying the sample to the reagent would have to be considered too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a COVID nurse in Boston, I can anecdotally speak to this. I've been seeing false negative results if the people doing to swab didn't go far back enough. Patient A got a quick swab around the inside of the nostril opening in the ED, and a second deep swab &quot;brain tickling&quot; one 12 hours later on the inpatient side of things. First one negative, second one positive. The swabs are known to have about 70% accuracy, so that's why we need to be sure we are getting a quality sample, and then repeat it for the high risk populations. Lastly, the microbiology techs would be more likely to contaminate themselves if it's just in a loose bag rather than a self contained test tube of viral medium, plus I would worry that the virus would die before the test was processed, leading to false negative results.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you swab the back of the nasopharynx with that swab, it's a big gunky piece of concentrated saliva/mucus/virus. </p>
<p>If you were to swab the mask, it would be a lot less concentrated and a lot less likely to be detected.</p>
<p>If your thoughts are... well if they are so small then why does it affect the person that you breathe onto? ... because inside the person the virus grows and multiplies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
