2: their backs are not strong enough for riding.
It's technically possible to tame a zebra and ride it but it's more of a headache than it's worth. If you see someone riding zebra in a movie - it's a horse with paint on it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Lastly, they don't have family structure that we can manipulate. Horses have a social hierarchy and, if you put yourself as Top Horse, you can control an entire herd. There is no Top Zebra. It's every zebra for itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, when it comes to domestication, you need to start with something already close to what you want, then refine it.  You can't add genetic traits (although if you are lucky you'll find a new mutation to exploit) so you have to chip away the less useful stuff, meaning you have to work with what was already there to begin with.</p>
<p>Wolves were already pack animals that could bond with things other than wolves as pack members, are naturally obedient to the pack leaders and have the speed, strength and fighting abilities to be useful, while also having the intelligence and self restraint to learn when to use it.  In other words they were already 95% where we needed them.  Breed out the most aggressive, stubborn traits and make them more friendly to people by nature and you are there, and the fox domestication experiments show that this can been done in a few decades if done on purpose.  Probably took longer in real life, but still relatively easy.</p>
<p>Likewise, Red Jungle Fowl were already tasty, laid an unusual amount of unfertilized eggs, could eat a variety of things that humans could not eat, and unlike most birds could be contained within a simple fence. Like with wolves, they are mostly there, so breeding them into chickens wasn't too hard to do.  Get them to lay eggs even more quickly and breed them a big larger for more meat and you had a very useful food animal that could turn things we couldn't eat into tasty, tasty meat and eggs.</p>
<p>The wild ancestor of horses would likewise have already had most of what we needed.  As others have said, the herd instinct where they follow a leader is useful, the fact they try to throw riders off instead of just crushing them, and they fact that they deal with danger by running from it rather than fighting it, gave us the ideal materials to work with.</p>
<p>Zebras just don't.  They are the right shape for riding and are fast and even more resilliant to disease, but their instinct make them very hard to capture, and must more dangerous.  They fight instead of just run.  They try to crush riders to death(and succeed) instead of just throwing them off.  They don't have an instinct to obey a leader.</p>
<p>You can't just breed things into them that don't exist.  You have to have something to work with, and they just don't have enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
