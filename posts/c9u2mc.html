		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is feasible to use solar sails as a boost to move around the solar system, but there are issues with diminishing returns using them more interstellar travel. As they get farther from the sun, the radiation pressure gets weaker and weaker as the sun appears smaller and smaller. Additionally, as the sail builds up velocity away from the sun, the incident radiation becomes Doppler shifted and the momentum transfer gets less and less efficient. There was a proposal a few years ago to develop super strong focused lasers to blast a radiation sail towards Alpha Centauri, which a physically possible but somewhat outlandish idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The further you are from the sun, the less benefit you can get from a solar sail.  Also, you start getting 'head wind' from other stars... this is actually good as you want to start slowing down at the half way point anyway, but a solar sail is not the answer to interstellar travel.  Ion drives or nuclear rockets are better options.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Writing on mobile, so excuse the abbreviations and inevitable typos.</p>
<p>I think this thread is missing some fundamental physics of solar sailing.  The forces acting on the craft are gravity and solar radiation pressure (SRP). (Note pressure, not force). Gravity pulls you in, SRP pushes in a direction related to its reflection (not directly outwards). The magnitude of SRP is related to some craft properties (reflectivity, flatness of the sail,  etc.) But more importantly, the photon flux (i.e. photons per square meter). This is a function of the solar luminosity and your distance from the sun. </p>
<p>Here is the cool physics bit that everyone should take home with them. Both gravity and photon flux are inverse functions of distance from the sun. Take the ratio of these and you end up with the golden ratio of solar sailing, in units of kg/m^2 (assuming some constant reflectivity).</p>
<ul>
<li>If you make a craft with a planar density heavier than this golden ratio, you can fly spiral orbits, a.la. electric propulsion orbits. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>if your craft has a planar density equal to this ratio, you can fly in a straight line, usually tangent to your initial orbit. </p>
</li>
<li>if your craft has a planar density lighter than the ratio, your orbit can be hyperbolic away from the sun. </li>
</ul>
<p>The issue with solar sail only crafts is you can't do mid course corrections easily.  Hope this helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. You can also use light sails and a ground based laser to accelerate your satellites. They have to be very lightweight though. <a href="https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/initiative/3" target="_blank">Breakthrough Starshot</a>'s goal is to send thousands of nanocrafts to Alpha Centauri using that method.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>No, attaching a solar sail to a spacecraft such that it no longer is in orbit makes it a probe, not a satellite.</p>
<p>Legit Reply:
Theoretically yes, but there are problems - solar sails impart so little force that the actual spacecraft would need to be incredibly lightweight, giving little room for scientific experiments, let alone radios. Making solar sails out of photovoltaic cells could work, however, the increase in mass and diminishing returns as you get further away from the star means you get little benefit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
