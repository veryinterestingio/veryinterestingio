The concentration may be too low for the disease to be detected, however it might not be too low to infect a person - remember than not that many particles are needed to start an infection.</p>
<p>Using a swab, on the other hand, basically guarantees a pristine and trustworthy sample, and it is therefore much more reliable, if a bit uncomfortable.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many occasions where you may want to diagnose a patient with early disease (viral load may come up later). A negative result with specimen obtained at the site of (presumed) highest viral load would be much more reassuring than a result obtained from a specimen collected from a less satisfactory site. </p>
<p>That said, the specimen requirement sometimes makes people avoid sampling because of the discomfort associated. At a time where people will outright refuse even masking, there probably exists a degree of compromise one can make in terms of specimen requirements to increase the uptake rate if wider testing is beneficial to epidemiological management of the disease...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A  small number of viruses can infect a person because they infect human  cells and replicate creating more viruses.  But they can't replicate  within a test kit to create more, you need to get a bigger sample to be reliably detectable than you need to infect someone.  Wouldn't want to give someone a false negative.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s because that’s where the virus is most concentrated so it reduces the likelihood of a false negative or positive. The most accurate testing requires it to be done that way, there are other tests but not as accurate.</p>
