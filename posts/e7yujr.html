	<title>ELI5. Why are large passenger/cargo aircraft designed with up swept low mounted wings and large military cargo planes designed with down swept high mounted wings?

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Military cargo aircraft use high mounted wings because it allows them to use unprepared or hastily prepared runways. Keeping the engines up high helps with not sucking in a bunch of dirt and rocks. Passenger aircraft operate pretty much exclusively from well maintain airports, so that isn't a big deal for them.</p>
<p>Upswept wings make a plane more stable in a roll. The aerodynamics work out so the plane's natural tendency is to want to roll back to wings-level. This makes the plane easier to fly, and generally more comfortable, but limits the rate at which it can roll.</p>
<p>High-wing large transports usually already have quite a lot of roll stability, so downswept wings are used to give them slightly more responsive handling, which helps when landing in adverse conditions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>also they are used sometimes on bad quality runways which may contain dirt and gravel, so again there is a desire to pull the engines up away from debris.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Military transports have a high-mounted wing in order to get the bottom of the fuselage as close to the ground as possible, so you can drive vehicles into them via a built-in ramp. It also reduces the obstacle clearance requirements on crudely-built forward-area runways.</p>
<p>The higher the wing is on the fuselage, the more stable the aircraft is in the yaw and roll axes. Airliners have dihedral (upswept wings) to take advantage of this. Military transports, with their high-mounted wings, would be <em>too</em> stable with dihedral -- so they have anhedral (downswept wings) to offset it.</p>
<p>There is one airliner with high, anhedral wings, the BAe146. Many of its passengers can't see the scenery because the engines are in the way -- worse, its only emergency exits are at the ends, because if you tried to abandon it amidships you'd run into a hot engine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>About &quot;dihedral&quot; and &quot;anhedral&quot;:</p>
<p>Those words just refer to the wing design shape you're talking about. Wings bent down is anhedral and wings bent up is dihedral. Dihedral is good because it improves the plane's stability while flying while anhedral makes it worse. We like our civilian passenger planes nice and safe and stable so we design them with dihedral. Military planes, like the c-5 and c-17, use anhedral not because they are made to be unstable, but actually because the wings create so much lift to make such a heavily loaded plane fly that they actually bend upward and have a slight dihedral while in flight</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
