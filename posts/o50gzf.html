		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Related, cancer rates also decreased. We donâ€™t think that this is a true decrease in cancer incidence, but rather that it reflects a decrease in cancer detection and diagnosis because routine screenings declined. Cancer rates are expected to spike this summer as people start having all the routine screening (mammograms, colonoscopies, etc) they had been putting off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I'm sure the data exists, but might not have been aggregated and published yet for 2020... these things take time).  If you scroll about halfway down the page, you'll see a graph showing annual US measles cases from 2010 through the end of 2020.  You'll see the annual count varies quite a bit but that 2020 was nonetheless significantly lower than any other year included in the graph, despite following after a record-high year.</p>

<p>Slide #9 here [<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/downloads/measlesdataandstatsslideset.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/downloads/measlesdataandstatsslideset.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/measles/downloads/measlesdataandstatsslideset.pdf</a></a>] shows some measles data going farther back in the US (but doesn't include 2019 or 2020), to give some context for the trend over the past two decades.  You can see a general rise in cases in line with rising anti-vaccination disinformation in the US.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
