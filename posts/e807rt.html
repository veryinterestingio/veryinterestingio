		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;nothing seems interested&quot; boring type have many people with depression. I know from that it's bc a lack of the &quot;good feeling hormones&quot;, so even if you do something you normally like, your body don't produce the hormone that much that it feels so good that you completely enjoying it.</p>
<p>But I don't know if this is for healthy people the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's actually a function of the brain designed to essentially help you focus on tasks efficiently and one to help you regulate your emotions, in really basic terms when you get depressed, the part of your brain to help you complete tasks stops working efficiently and this is a similar process for procrastination and I'm suspecting boredom, it gets harder to do tasks which restricts dopamine which means that your cells are not becoming efficient at distributing it so less is released.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Boredom&quot; is very subjective, has multiple variables, and is different from person to person because we are all just a little bit different from each other. </p>
<p>In order for each brain to be functioning &quot;optimally&quot;, we all need various levels of sleep, hydration, nutrition, exercise, and even sun exposure (kind of like a plant! Some plants need a LOT of sunlight, others need a shady corner. All are different) or even human interaction! If these are out of whack for that particular person, that brain (and body) will not perform as optimally. </p>
<p>Once those basics are covered, we can move onto: mental diets. What are we feeding our brains? All of our brains have all of these different neuronal networks, kind of like highways, streets, and even back alleyways or country roads based off the learning and experiences we give it. The more you travel a certain path, or if you have a higher interest in a certain path, the easier it is to access that path, and the path will become bigger, stronger, more connected. So, over time, a country road can turn into a super highway depending on how frequently you travel that path. This doesn't mean all roads/behaviors we travel are healthy. Sometimes we may confuse boredom with trying to avoid feeling something. </p>
<p>Some people find certain things more interesting than others (partially due to all of our different mental maps and roads we've created, and partially because we are all different, er, plants), so it's easy to pay attention to things we are interested in or have the experience for. </p>
<p>Other things are just plain boring because it doesn't interest us or we don't have the level of experience in order to appreciate it, so we have to call on our mental reserve to practice sustained attention on that boring something. This mental reserve runs out for all of us if the activity is too long, and we get grumpy or impatient, etc. So, try to sandwich those really boring activities with rest breaks, and reward yourself AFTER you've completed that activity with something you enjoy to give your brain that boost you need to continue to do that really boring thing.</p>
<p>If you find yourself bored, there's a few things you can do: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>see if you need to rest or relax or take care of the basics (hydrate, eat, sleep, exercise, etc.) We are more likely to become bored or disinterested (or even impatient) if our basics aren't being taken care of. It's kind of like your bodies way of saying &quot;I need something.&quot; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>do something you enjoy (go down that super highway you know you love!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>do something new (make a new road!)</p>
</li>
<li>check in with yourself. A lot of modern culture thrives off of that &quot;need&quot; to do something new. We have created a culture that is addicted to dopamine. Boredom isn't necessarily bad.
