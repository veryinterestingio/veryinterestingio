		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR Modern lenses of both the soft and rigid variety are made with hydrogels and other gas permeable materials that are very &quot;wet&quot; so they don't irritate your eye as it just kinda blends into the fluids already on the eyes surface, while allowing gas exchange to occur with your eye (which doesn't receive oxygen via blood). However eventually due to degradation the lens will start to cause you problems at which point it must be discarded and replaced. The comfier and lens, the shorter it will last (with the softest, thinnest ones lasting only a day)</p>
<p>Eyelashes are hard, solid objects not coated in liquid and thus irritate your very sensitive eyeball that only likes to be touched by wet things.</p>
<p>Long explanation: </p>
<p>Contact lenses are extremely wet, to the point water molecules is used in some lenses construction. I have astigmatism which is one of the most common causes of vision problems, it means my eyes aren't perfectly spherical. So if I wish to use contact lenses I gotta buy special ones that are something like 70% water and super soft. They're made of a silicone-hydro gel I believe and they just mold to my eyes particular shape.</p>
<p>The reason they don't hurt (if you put them on the right way), is they're extremely oxygen permeable (they let gases pass through them). See due to the fact your eyeball must be transparent, it doesn't have blood vessels running to the cornea. So your eyes receive the oxygen they need via gas exchange directly with the air. So contact lenses must allow gas to flow past them into the eye and out of it. </p>
<p>Early on the only lenses that we had were Rigid lenses, which are still a thing. The early ones were NOT permeable and caused a lot of eye irritation. They've now developed much like the soft mostly water ones, and become a lot more gas permeable while still been stiff. With the rigid one you will feel discomfort for a short time as your eye doesn't want it there, with rigid lenses often you have to have an &quot;adjustment&quot; period where your body gets used to them but these days its not much of an issue cause they're made using similar hydro-gel techniques, but before the 1970's they weren't very comfy.</p>
<p>BUT the key factor is they still inevitably end up irritating your eye. Contact lenses come in varying duration. The thinner and lighter your lens is the more comfortable it will feel but the shorter its lifespan. So you have lenses that last only a day and then need to be discarded and there are some very rarely used varieties that can last years but come with lots of comfort drawbacks. </p>
<p>As you remove and replace a lens, it gets slightly damaged, it gets germs and irritants and even if you store it in cases and wash it in its special fluid eventually it becomes a risk to your eyes health.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
