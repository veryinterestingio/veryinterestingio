		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a little bit complicated, and still being actively researched.</p>
<p>The basic concept is that when you are reading or thinking about something, your mind actually does almost all the same things as if you were going to speak it. When you read this sentence you mind is actually doing 90% of the same things as if you were going to speak it.</p>
<p>Older <a href="https://curiosity.com/topics/what-is-the-little-voice-in-your-head-curiosity/" target="_blank">studies</a> found that the larynx is making tiny mico movements when you hear the voice in your head. Newer <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/263428.php" target="_blank">studies</a> have found that the mind anticipates the noises you make when you actually speak, and thus filters them to avoid sensation confusion. When you read or think in your voice the mind is making that same anticipation reflex which is why you hear it in your own voice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It appears to be related to language, considering that deaf people don't &quot;hear&quot; an inner monologue, but have a <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/the-voices-within/201401/do-deaf-people-hear-inner-voice" target="_blank">signed inner monologue instead</a>. In fact some linguists believe our capacity for rational thought and abstract problem solving is related to language as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>But goes beyond that. We have two voices in our head. While you are reading this you mimic the speaking process but at the same time you are thinking other things. You are reading and at the same time saying to yourself, he is right I’m reading and thinking about this and other things. And if you speak, reading in you mind another sentence in a text, you speak, read in your mind and think at the same time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not just deaf people, but what about people who existed before language? How would they have heard their own inner monologue? If people speak multiple languages, how do they choose which to think in? And how do animals relate to this? One would assume they too have an inner voice but without language how does that work? </p>
<p>Thank you. It’s a very interesting topic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
