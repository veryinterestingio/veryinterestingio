		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL; DR - commercial/retail banks take deposits. Investment banks create securities. [oversimplified]</p>
<p>First off, most banks are commercial banks (aka retail banks). In general they take deposits from individuals and make loans, as well as offering services like credit cards. </p>
<p>Investment banking works more with the markets directly relating to financial securities (stocks, bonds, derivatives, etc) and financial advisory services. But investment banks do not take deposits. </p>
<p>Want to have your company go public and be listed on a stock exchange? The can determine a listing price and distribution. Need to issue $10B in bonds, they can partner with other firms to create the terms and get them sold. Want to merge with another company? They help with due diligence and the terms and the funding (loans, stock conversions, etc.).</p>
<p>Traditionally (at least since the 1933 Glassâ€“Steagall legislation) these were separate institutions. Many banks collapsed (for instance) when they used deposits to speculate on the markets. These functions are still separate but can be housed in one corporation. And most investment banks chose or were pressured to become commercial banks (at least from a regulatory perspective) after the crisis of 2008.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most ELI5 interpretation of them is that investment banking has one job, and that job is to help their clients find money for their business. They find investors. They help companies merge etc.</p>
<p>By definition,  <strong>Investment banking</strong> is a special segment of <strong>banking</strong> operation that helps individuals or organisations raise capital and provide financial consultancy services to them.</p>
<p><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/investment-banking" target="_blank"><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/investment-banking" target="_blank">https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/investment-banking</a></a> </p>

<p>Investment banking sells services. They can help you whether you want to buy something, or sell something. They aren't the buyers or sellers themselves, they are advisors. All investment banking activity is classed as either &quot;sell side&quot; or &quot;buy side&quot;. The &quot;sell side&quot; involves trading securities for cash or for other securities (e.g. facilitating transactions, market-making), or the promotion of securities (e.g. underwriting, research, etc.). The &quot;buy side&quot; involves the provision of advice to institutions that buy investment services. Private equity funds, mutual funds, life insurance companies, unit trusts, and hedge funds are the most common types of buy-side entities. taken from  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_banking" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment\_banking" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment\_banking</a></a> </p>
<p><strong>DO NOT CONFUSE INVESTMENT BANKING AND INVESTMENT TRADING.</strong> They have touching points but they are not the same. Investment banking will help you get your company on the open market so you can sell your stocks (1st hand). Investment trading will buy your stocks, sell them forward (2nd hand), and also deals with many more financial instruments (option trading, bonds, FOREX etc.)</p>
<p>P.S. if you wish to lose all knowledge of investment trading and descend into madness, go to r/wallstreetbets and leave your sanity at the door.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think real estate agents. Every time you want to buy or sell a house, you get an agent that does the heavy lifting for you and takes a percentage cut. </p>
<p>IB does the same when a firm needs to buy, sell or IPO. The process to do these require a lot of specialized knowledge on the area and market conditions and firms are better off outsourcing these fairly difficult and niche tasks (like buying or selling a house, only really happens a couple times in the life of a firm) to experts who who do this day in and out. Just like making a bad real estate investments, a bad M&amp;A (mergers and acquisition) or a bad IPO could be ruinious to the firm in the short - medium run, so firms are willing to pay the massive fees that these IB firms command. [2-3% of $1B raised is a lot of money]. </p>
<p>I think the real estate agent analogy holds for a lot of these. Some clarifications: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Yes, IBD does only mergers, acquisitions, and IPOs. For other related activities like raising debt capital, there are other related teams in the capital markets division of the banks. IB sits under capital markets as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is it so lucrative? Surface reason, money. 2-3% of $1B being earned by a team of ~10 IB is a lot of revenue per employee for the bank. They get bonuses accordingly. Also, the work you do is incredibly impact. You can be working on the biggest deal in the industry that year and advising on where $1B+ of capital is going to be deployed!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it a lot of work? Yes. These deals are usually massive and have a lot of work that needs to be done before. It is also extremely time sensitive. So during crunch time its not uncommon to put in ~100 office/week at the office. </p>
</li>
<li>Usually called the sell side of the deal because it is usually the seller who bears the 2-3% fee that bankers charge (just like real estate agents again!)</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say you own a bakery. You need money to expand. So you go to a normal bank and get a loan.</p>
<p>Now let's say you own 10,000 bakeries and you need money to expand each one. You could go to a regular bank and get a loan, but you might not like the terms or they might not be able to lend you all that money. So instead, you go to an investment bank. The investment bank finds a bunch of investors who want to lend you money, and helps you issue bonds to those investors (a bond is essentially a promise to pay someone back for a loan they made you). Or, the investment bank helps you raise the money by finding investors who want to buy part of your business, and helps you navigate the various requirements for you to issue stock to them in exchange for the money.</p>
<p>Investment banks also offer advisory services, like helping you analyze whether to purchase that other chain of bakeries who is your main competition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Investment banks are companies that work with investments - for example, they help companies to issue stock and bonds, advise on buying other companies or assets, create derivatives based on the value of underlying assets or indices, trade financial instruments, create structured products like securitized mortgages or loans, all that fun stuff. They also donâ€™t traditionally take deposits - you arenâ€™t supposed to be able to open a chequing account with an investment bank. They work purely in the world of capital markets, mergers and acquisitions and sometimes wealth management.</p>
<p>Investment bankers basically are people who work for investment banks or investment banking arms of full-service banks. The career is typified by very long hours and high pay.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
