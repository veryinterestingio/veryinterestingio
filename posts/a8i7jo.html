		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Shutting down the government means that a spending bill was not passed. </p>
<p>When the government is shut down, non essential projects and personal get furloughed. Essential workers and department with appropriated funds still go about their daily business.</p>
<p>It’s essentially a hostage tactic to get your way. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think if it this way... Husband and wife sit down and try to build a budget.  They know how much money they have, the real question is where and how to spend it.  Some categories have been decided upon already.  Mortgage is paid, utilities are paid, and car insurance is paid.  Now, we need to decide on food... He wants half the food budget to be on restaurants and the other half on grocery store.  She wants to be conservative and spend less in general with only %25 going to restaurants.  They are at an impass and there for nobody gets any food.  I.e. the governance when it comes to food is shut down.</p>
<p>Now for the folks discussing employee pay, yes we are on furlough but the money for pay exists and is not in contention so it will be paid to the employees when the government opens. In fact, a bill is in the works to guarantee this.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and he wants a security system installed because he thinks too many people who weren't invited are eating his food.  She's not having any of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well I can't explain it all but I do know that many of the employees that don't end up working that day get back pay for the lost wages...but the &quot;essential employees&quot; that do have to work get paid the same and have to go to work. </p>
<p>So the shutdowns end up costing nearly the same as keeping the government open but no work gets done, a net loss. </p>
<p>Here's a question, what is Congress doing during this shutdown? Going home for the holidays and collecting full salary. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a side-effect of the US having a very badly designed budget system where they stop spending money on everybody (except themselves) if the politicians can't agree on the budget plan.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every year congress must pass and the President must approve a budget which defines how much money the government will spend. If this doesn’t happen only the very most essential functions continue and everything else stops because the government isn’t allowed to spend money. </p>
<p>In this case leaders in congress had a deal to pass a budget that would fund the government into February but Trump convinces republicans in the Senate to push for his pet project, the Border Wall. </p>
<p>So what does this accomplish? In this case Trump and some Republicans are betting that the shutdown will cause congress to give in to his demands. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
