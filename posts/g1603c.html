		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They get absorbed by the surroundings! Photons are electromagnetic waves, so when they come to matter, they &quot;wave&quot; the electrons in the matter around, so the photons lose their energy are are absorbed. This is why a wall in the sun feels hot! The light is being absorbed by the wall and all energy goes into the wall feeling hot.</p>
<p>As a side note, this is a simplification. Like mirrors don't absorb light, they reflect it. For that matter, most materials reflect some amount of light, that's why we can see them. But all materials absorb light, even in small amounts, so eventually all the light would be absorbed by the material.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>when the light is turned off the photons already in the room will eventually collide with a particle in the wall/air/furniture. That particle will absorb the photon. This particle's speed will now increase (vibration, rotation, linear, or combination off all 3). Now theres 2 options. either the particle will re-emit a photon and lose speed OR bounce into another particle and transfer   some speed to it. Since the particles in your room are always bouncing and rubbing up against one another, after a few repititions of absorb-&gt;re emit-&gt;reabsorb, all the photon energy in the room will have eventually just been converted to speed energy. This happens super fast. Thats why it kinda looks like the light just disappeared instantly.  </p>
<p>Another word for average speed energy of all the particles in a room is  Temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can someone explain how colors works with cones  and rods. When a room is dimly lit colors appear washed out and almost grey. They are still the color they are but our perception almost makes them black and white. The light itself doesnâ€™t give things their color, but the intensity of the light changes our perception of the object. </p>
<p>Is color more dependent on the light source/intensity or our eyes?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
