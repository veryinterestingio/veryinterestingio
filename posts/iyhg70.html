I tested to see if I could taste it 'forever' by just leaving it in my mouth, but after a few seconds it kinda stopped tasting like anything. But as soon as I went to swallow it, I could taste it again.</p>
<p>Moving it around in my mouth seems to get the taste working again, but it doesn't work quite as well as swallowing it or taking a new bite.</p>
<p>Why does this happen? Does it happen to anyone else? Does our body have a mechanism to prevent &quot;taste cheating&quot;?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plug your nose and take a sip. Tastes like nothing, right? Chewing food and moving it in your mouth allows aromatic particles to become airborne. Those aromatics are a huge contributor to things having a taste. That's also why you can &quot;taste&quot; your food/drink again briefly after you've just swallowed some. I'm not a biologist, but I know the body does also have ways of normalizing itself to stimulus. I would assume a part of that may also be a play here, since your brain tends to ignore stimuli that become normal. Like how you go nose blind to the smell of a bathroom, or how you might stop hearing a clock ticking in a room when it is quiet. Those stimuli are still there, but your brain phases them out because it is constantly adjusting itself to stimuli to try and keep you from spending too much energy on unnecessary details.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm curious now, though. If you took a sip of your chocolate shake, then agitated it in your mouth with your tongue while breathing through your nose, you might be able to &quot;taste cheat&quot; it. Maybe you've stumbled onto a new diet fad!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the taste buds get tired after sending your brain flavor signals. Moving the flavors to a new part of your tongue means new taste buds that are rested can send you the signals again.</p>
<p>Your body does have a mechanism to prevent &quot;taste cheating!&quot;</p>
<p>Swallowing tastes the best because that way you send food to your stomach. If the best part of eating was holding food in the front of your mouth, you would just take one bite and sit there enjoying it. You have the most taste buds at the very back of your tongue, and the only way to hit them is swallowing. No taste cheating! Mother nature caught that exploit millions of years ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you've saturated your taste buds and so your brain is filtering out their signals. That's why moving it around in your mouth brings the taste back- you're exposing new taste receptors to the food while giving the others a chance to reset.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how, when playing a game, you can sometimes get drift on a control stick, or motion controls can get off center, and for software that allows proper calibration, you can “recenter” the controls, thus telling the game that whatever inputs it is currently receiving should be treated as default?</p>
<p>Your body is constantly doing that to some degree with all of your senses. Keep one stimulus going for too long with no change and it’ll start being treated as default and get tuned out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it is mostly due to our senses really are great at noticing change.  Our brains seem to filter out things that are constant, like smells, tastes, sounds, touches.  If someone rests their hand on your shoulder for a long time, you forget it is there until they move it off.  If you are in a smelly area you notice it at first (like a tuna processing plant or something) but after a while you get &quot;used to it&quot; and it becomes a norm, but if someone new comes into the room they'll comment on the smell.  Even our eyes are great at noticing movement, but if something is unmoving we tend to not notice it.  I think it is just our brains being efficient with the input it is receiving from all of these senses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
