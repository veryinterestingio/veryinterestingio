		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ul>
<li>
<p>The engine is updated as development progresses. For example in RDR2 maybe they didn't add their volumetric lighting and weather effects until the end of development. </p>
</li>
<li>Not all development even needs a fully functioning game engine. Years could be spent simply on world design, making models, writing scripts, recording dialogue, motion capture etc. before they start to assemble it all into a virtual world.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>game devs often interact with hardware devs and have access to development kits, with features not yet available to the public</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/22-years-3-developers-only-2-games-the-fascinating-history-of-the-prey-series/" target="_blank">projects have tanked because of poor communication/choices between devs and the hardware folks</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Timing and industry changes turned to trouble for Prey. It was mostly developed on the 3DFX card and the Glide API (&quot;It was the hot shit API of the day,&quot; Schuytema says) but internal troubles at 3DFX hit just as the Prey team was ready to go all-in with Glide. Meanwhile, Microsoft was getting its Direct X API off the ground. The team moved away from Glide, and ended up going with Direct X instead.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They lock themselves into an engine API, but they don't spend 7 years working with the same version.  Every few months, they baseline a better version of the game.  Sometimes that version just has more &quot;game&quot; in it and sometimes it has migrated to a better version of the engine.  It's not a 7-year straight line, that wouldn't have likely been funded.  Rather it's an iterative process that just took 40-ish iterations to get a game that was great enough to release.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The great thing about using game engines in the first place to make games, is that it keeps the &quot;data,&quot; and the &quot;engine,&quot; pretty separate. This means you can have one group working on making models, textures, level scripting, etc. and another team can work on improving the engine and keeping up with modern tech. As long as the team working on the engine don't change the way the engine reads data, then it will just load in the same data the way it always has, just with better graphics or whatever. Only if there is a breaking change would things have to be re-done.</p>
<p>This is also a big reason (not the only reason though) why we see &quot;fake,&quot; E3 trailers and such. When a game is announced really early, they are running on a PC that's light-years ahead of current tech, using models and maps that would never run on a modern system, simply because that's where the devs <em>think</em> tech will be in 7+ years. Sometimes they get this wrong and have to scale back</p>
<p><del>-------------------------------------------</del></p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I'm getting the same questions a lot about the &quot;fake,&quot; E3 trailers and such, so I'll post the answers here:</p>
<ul>
<li>It happens</li>
<li>Game devs aren't stupid. They know nobody looks good when the released game doesn't live up to the hype.</li>
<li>Devs that have a more corporate structure are more susceptible to this, as they have to pitch games to more &quot;business types,&quot; who don't understand how games are developed and it's more effective to show flashy graphics than 15 power-point pages explaining your revolutionary game-mechanic or technology. Same deal when you're making an E3 trailer.</li>
<li>Games that fall into the &quot;cross-gen,&quot; release window are especially susceptible to this as you are targeting still-in-development hardware which you want to push to it's limits, but those limits are frequently changing. You guess at what you think you'll be able to get running, and then you cross your fingers hoping you actually can by launch.</li>
<li>There <em>is</em> a level of responsibility of the devs to communicate early on that the game is changing, however game development is so incredibly turbulent that it's difficult to even know when to cut your losses. The general audience also needs to understand that features are cut because they don't work out, things change, that's development.</li>
<li>The situation with CDPR was the perfect storm of failures in PR and management, combined with the points above that it failed so spectacularly and ended up an outlier and an edge-case.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would really recommend everyone who is interested in game-dev to give yourself a 2-month limit and make a small game. It's extremely fun and rewarding, but it will really shatter your understanding of what actually goes into making one of these things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's easy to forget, but a game that released a year ago may have started development even before RDR2 did, so in a way we're seeing today the results of industry trends 5+ years ago in games releasing now. </p>
<p>Beyond that, major game releases like this tend to communicate their needs to Nvidia and AMD, and those GPU companies take that information and will often tailor their upcoming GPU architectures to suit various industry trends, within reason, of course.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
