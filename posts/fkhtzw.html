		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of the leaked blood will coagulate and help to form the clot / scab to stop the bleeding.</p>
<p>Macrophages will come and clean up any &quot;loose&quot; blood, or debris, or old scab material - they take it in, digest it, and spit the digested remains out into the blood stream where it's filtered out in the kidneys.</p>
<p>The iron (I think) attaches to iron-transporting-proteins that are floating around in the blood, and eventually makes its way back to the red bone marrow where it's used to make new hemoglobin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Macrophages digesting the blood is why bruises go though a number of stages of colour. </p>
<p>First you get a red bruise, this is fresh blood.</p>
<p>Second it becomes a dark blue/purple bruise.</p>
<p>As macrophages digest the blood they break down the haemoglobin and create a byproduct called biliverdin this is green and causes the next stage, green coloured bruise. </p>
<p>This is then broken down to form a yellow/brown bruise. This fades as the broken down materials are reabsorbed by the body. </p>
<p>If the blood collects into a pool within the body, this will not get broken down, this is called a haematoma and requires draining.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body has two systems which transport fluid, the circulatory and the lymphatic. The circulatory system is where the blood is and which carried nutrients. To get the nutrients to the body tissues, it must be a little porous. Fluid must be able to pass through its walls but not allow the red blood cells out. This means that there is a constant movement of fluid smaller than cells in and out of the blood vessels. This rate can vary depending on the composition of the blood, but should always result in a net movement of fluid out of the blood vessels into what is called the interstitial areas. This would cause accumulation of fluid and swelling if it was not drained which you can see in patient who have malfunctioning lymphatic systems. The lymphatic system is what collects the fluid and transports it back to the blood vessels. The lymphatic system also works as a sort of filtration system for things in the fluid. </p>
<p>A bruise forms when some blood vessels get damaged and blood leaks into the interstitial space. Firstly, that leak must be stopped. Secondly, that spilled blood must be cleaned up. A type of white blood cell called macrophages arrive at the scene to swallow all the debris, some of which is red blood cells. Now red blood cells are valuable. They contain three parts, a complex called heme, some iron atoms, and some protein. The proteins are digested in the macrophages down to amino acids to be reused. The iron is fixed to a transport protein and delivered to the bone marrow where it can be recycled. The heme however is broken down into a byproduct called biliverdin, named for its greenish color. This is what you see when a bruise changes color to green. The macrophages then take the biliverdin to the liver where it is broken down again into bilirubin, named for its reddish color. The liver excretes the bilirubin in bile to the digestive tract for disposal. This gives stool itâ€™s reddish brownish color. If bile is not properly excreted, stool will take a chalky whitish color.</p>
<p>The remaining fluid from the leak in the bruise will be drained by the lymphatic system, and the blood vessels will regrow where they were severed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
