		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neurotransmitters are critical in the process of creating neural &quot;pathways&quot;, the transmission of electrical signals from synapse to synapse to synapse.  Part of that process is for the neurotransmitters to &quot;bind&quot; (attach) to certain types of receptors on the synapses.  LSD and other hallucinogens disrupt how this process is supposed to work, as they can bind to the receptors but don't work like the natural neurotransmitters are supposed to.  </p>
<p>In this way, they actually create spurious pathways in the brain that would not otherwise occur.  In addition, in some parts of the brain they appear to inhibit the operation of the normal pathways, reducing the function of those areas. Part of that action seems to inhibit some of the sensory filtering that normally occurs in the thalamus (IIRC), so other areas of the brain are bombarded with information they usually doesn't have to deal with.  This may cause the formation/use of more pathways than normal, or at least, different pathways.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Why do hallucinogens make you hallucinate if they are just binding to the same dopamine and serotonin receptors as other drugs</strong></p>
<p>The short answer is that they <strong><em>don't</em></strong> <em>bind to the same receptors</em> as other drugs; there are many serotonin receptor types that have different effects when activated.  Keeping in mind this is a bit of a simplification:</p>
<p>Classical psychedelics are often defined by their activation of 5-HT2A serotonin receptors specifically.  They activate other receptors, too, but (except LSD) they don't generally target dopamine or even many other serotonin receptors.  That's why many 'designer drugs' made to mimic illegal psychedelics are highly selective for 5-HT2A.</p>
<p>Cocaine, for example, is serotonergic to some extent but it doesn't affect the same serotonin receptors as classical psychedelics - 5-HT3 and some 5-HT2, but not the same ones as LSD, mescaline, mushrooms, etc.</p>
<p>(Serotonin in particular is a very complicated neurotransmitter in terms of all of the effects it can have)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>LSD and psilocybin mostly stop your brain from filtering out extra information. </p>
<p>Most of the colors and patterns you notice are actually there most of the time, but your brain has learned that they arenâ€™t useful, so they are filtered out. (Your eyes and ears are messy, wet, error prone things, they have a lot of weird tendencies... did you know your ears can act as speakers and MAKE sounds?)</p>
<p>Similar things happen between processing centers of the brain. Usually processing centers do not talk to each other much (why does the part of my brain that controls my right hand need to know what I am smelling right now?). Hallucinogens allow/force these regions to talk, and as you might expect, the smell of rosemary confuses the hell out of my pinky.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The fact of the matter is that <em>we just don't know</em> exactly why and how hallucinogens work the way they do in our human brains, in much the same way that we do not really know how consciousness works, or even what it is. Maybe we will someday, but for now it's a mystery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
