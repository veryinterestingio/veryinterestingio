		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot more parties, so we usually have like 6-8 candidates on the ballot. Only Democrats and Republicans get a reasonable number of votes though.</p>
<p>For why they each put forward just one candidate... Elections (or Caucuses) are held for voting within a party to narrow a field of potential candidates for the general election. The thought is by only having one candidate for the party, you consolidate your votes and have a higher chance of your party winning.</p>
<p>Overall the party setup we have is stupid and the first president warned against it. We've had parties since the second president though...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other people do run but because of the way the American elections are set up and the fact that the two largest parties have so much money and influence, the other people will never win, so are largely ignored by the media and everyone else. The fact that they are so ignored then contributes to their inability to win as it is harder for them to reach an audience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's caused by the way american elections work. The country is divided into little areas and each area gets a certain number of points. To win the presidency you need the most points. Each area votes independently from all the others and all the points go to the one candidate with the most votes.</p>
<p>This makes people afraid that if they don't make someone else win, that the candidate that they <strong>don't want</strong> is going to win. So people gather behind the candidates that is most likely to win - instead of the candidate that they feel best represents themselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
