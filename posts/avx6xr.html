		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wage stagnation.</p>
<p>Since the late 70s, businesses have worked hard to limit the rise in wages from the ground up.  This has been aided and encouraged by Republicans in Congress, fighting any kind of increase in the minimum wage.</p>
<p>There was a time in the 60s where a guy could work a 40 hour a week job, base level, and have enough to pay the bills, and his wife could stay home and raise the kids.  That was the NORM.  There was even 2 weeks every year for everyone to go on vacation if they wanted, and they generally did.  </p>
<p>But, that's long since gone.  The moneyed interests in the US have ensured that we're all poor or the working poor.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there are two things to address here. The first is real wages and the second is home values. </p>
<p>But first, let's get some simple facts on the board. Quick googling shows that the median janitor makes about $24k (2k/month), and the median house price is about $225k. A mortgage calculator says that house would have a payment of $1,065 per month. That's well in excess of the &quot;you should pay 1/3 of your income to housing&quot; rule-of-thumb, but it's not unusual today for people to pay closer to 1/2 (more on that later). So it seems like the average janitor today can maybe afford the average house today.  I don't have the historical data at hand to say how true this was 50 years ago. How much do these averages matter? More on that too. </p>
<p>So, real wages. Real wages are wages after accounting for inflation. Nominal salaries basically always go up, but if they rise slower than inflation, <em>real</em> wages are falling. Economists think that for some segments of the labor force, real wages have maybe been falling for the past few decades. The main explanation they have for this is technological change. Computers and machines haven't actually changed the job of a janitor that much, but they have wreaked havoc on the jobs of lots of other people (factory workers, clerks, and others whose jobs can be easily automated). Those people still want to work somewhere, and some of them have become janitors. This increased supply of potential janitors has kept the real wage of janitors low. </p>
<p>Housing. In many parts of the country, the price of housing has risen much faster than inflation, so even workers with flat or slightly rising real wages are being priced out of some housing markets (the most obvious example is San Francisco). There are a couple of reasons for this. Lots of people are falling out of love with suburbs and moving back into dense urban cores where land is expensive. The housing stock continues to become larger, safer, and generally nicer to live in. Productivity increases elsewhere have made other aspects of living cheaper. That is to say, a janitor today may have trouble finding an affordable house near his job, but many of the things he buys day-to-day (food, clothing, consumer electronics, entertainment) are relatively cheaper than they used to be. There's an argument to be made that this is all just about people rationally shifting their spending from consumer goods to housing, buying bigger/nicer/better-located houses in the process. </p>
<p>It all gets more complicated when you add in the facts that a janitor needs to be physically present to do his work, janitorial services are needed where there are lots of people, and the places where we have lots of people are getting more expensive to live in. This is why the math at the top may not be particularly relevant to a real-world janitor who isn't inclined to commute hours to his job. These are problems that could probably benefit from a targeted policy solution like mixed-income housing developments in urban cores. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
