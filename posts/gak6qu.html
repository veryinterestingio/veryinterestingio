		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most furry animals that live in cold climates have different layers of fur, which helps them dry up quickly once out of the water.</p>
<p>Basically, double coat animal fur has three layers which work in thermoregulation, keeping cold air and moisture out and warm air in (next to the skin) in the cold, as well as shedding water that falls onto the fur.</p>
<p>The <strong>undercoat</strong> is the layer closest to the animal and it's wavy or curly, acting as an insulator keeping the warm air that comes from the animal in a &quot;pocket&quot; next to the skin. The second, middle layer is the <strong>awn hair</strong>, which is a mix of undercoat and guard hair (next layer), having a double function: the part closest to the skin is wavy like the undercoat, sorta as a &quot;backup&quot; undercoat keeping the heat inside the fur, while the tips are stiff and straight like the guard hairs. And finally, the <strong>guard hairs</strong>, which are the longest and stiffest part of the coat, the outer layer. One of it's functions is being effectively waterproof and helping guide water out of the animal's fur as it shakes itself dry.</p>
<p>This wintery coat is so effective that animals can actually lick themselves dry, given that their fur repels so much water, that their tongues can &quot;pull&quot; the water out of the strands.</p>
<p>(also completely anecdotal, I have a double coat dog and it takes longer to get him wet than it does getting him dry lol)</p>
<p>Sorry for any confusing words, english isn't my first language and I'm quite tired</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They generally stay near the water after getting out. The springs lend some heat and humidity as they dry out a bit. Looking at my photos, I only have one or two that are noticeably wet. One of them is near the barley bin they use to get them to hang out a bit longer. I believe he's there because of the food in particular. But you can get a sense of the huskesque fur they have.   </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something nobody else has mentioned is that the Japanese Snow Monkeys are trained to use the hot-springs, and that it's not a natural behavior. The monkeys are at a single small nature reserve in Nagano prefecture called Jigokudani Monkey Park that is basically a zoo/tourist attraction. The employees are known to coax the monkeys into the hot springs when visitors are there so the tourists are able to take photos and leave good reviews. </p>
<p>Nature documentaries make it seem like the monkeys are secluded from civilization and can only be reached by wildlife experts and guides, like gorillas in Congo, when in reality tourists are bused there daily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No expert but I imagine it's the same way that any animal in that type of environment does.  Seals, penguins, bears usually have an undercoat that insulates them and repels water along with a combination of being warm blooded and having an insulating layer of fat just works.  Polar bears even have hollow hairs that increase heat retention.</p>
<p>Some of the smarter monkeys just carry instant heat packs that they buy at the monkey store.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
