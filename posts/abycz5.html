		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two important properties of a high-quality hashing algorithm are the Avalanche Effect (whereby a small change to the input should have a massive change to the output) and Collision Resistance (whereby it should be computationally difficult to find two inputs that generate the same hash code).  Based on hashing alone, use of a proper and secure hashing algorithm should ideally make detecting whether or not two passwords are similar impossible.</p>
<p>Sadly, the truth of the matter is that in all too many cases, the best practice of storing and comparing password hashes is often not implemented.  <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/7xdeby/t-mobile-stores-part-of-customers-passwords-in-plaintext-says-it-has-amazingly-good-security" target="_blank">Some big companies still store passwords as plaintext</a>, while others <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_ibm_i_71/rzahy/rzahypwdencrypt.htm" target="_blank">still use password encryption</a>^0.  Chances are very high that if you're encountering a site that can determine whether or not a new password is similar to an old password, they're either storing your password as plaintext (or partial plaintext), or are encrypting/decrypting your password.</p>
<p>That said, there are methods even with hashing that could be used to detect when two passwords are too close together.  While researching this response, I came across an interesting paper^1 that details a method of monitoring keystroke dynamics when entering a password.  By measuring <em>how</em> a person types their password, you could generate a bunch of subsets of the keystrokes in the password and compare that to a stored set of dynamics to determine if some subset of those dynamics appears to be for the same set of keystrokes.</p>
<p>You could also conceivably store a password as a series of hashes for various password character subsets.  Unsalted, this would be almost as wildly insecure as storing a password in plaintext (as there are only roughly 24 million hashes for all sets of four characters^2, making it easy to pre-generate them all and rebuild the password by just looking them up in a database).  Adding a decent length salt would help, and would provide a way to test for n-lists of identical characters in a row using only hashing.^3</p>
<p>However, as noted above, any site that provides such a &quot;feature&quot; probably isn't storing your password using a cryptographic hash (or at least not <em>solely</em> as a cryptographic hash).  The Avalanche Effect should make determining password &quot;closeness&quot; from a secure hash alone impossible, without resorting to tricks like keystroke dynamics.</p>
<hr />
<p>^0 -- it's important to note that whereas <em>hashing</em> is a one-way function (put password in, get a hash out) that can't be reversed, <em>encryption</em> is defined as a pair of functions, one of which can <em>encrypt</em> a password, and another which can take the encrypted form and <em>decrypt</em> it back to the password again.<br />
^1 -- Jenkins, J. L., Grimes, M., Proudfoot, J. G., and Lowry, P. B. (2014). Improving password cybersecurity through inexpensive and minimally invasive means: Detecting and deterring password reuse through keystroke-dynamics monitoring and just-in-time fear appeals.  Information Technology for Development,41920(2):196â€“213.<br />
^2 -- I'm assuming here a fairly standard sets of acceptable password characters [A-Z][a-z][0-9] and some punctuation to get a rough estimate only.<br />
^3 -- note that I haven't done a full security analysis of using such a mechanism, so even salted, please don't use this system in something that requires good security.  However, this might make an interesting avenue of research for an advanced Honours student or a new Masters student to look into, even if only to determine that it's a terrible idea that should never be implemented in practice!  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
