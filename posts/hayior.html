		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is they do have inbreeding problems, but they go away after a few generations. It ecology it is known as the bottleneck effect. Basically a species is almost wiped out and then it recovers but the genetic diversity is much lower. It can lead a species to be particularly vulnerable to certain diseases. As for inbreeding issues keep in mind that even close relatives only have a higher chance of mutation not a good chance of mutation. I dont remember the numbers off the top of my head but I think in the most extreme situations the chance for mutation is less than 10 percent. And that number drops lower than 5 % when inbreeding with first cousins and almost identical to normal mutation chances once breeding with third cousins. Eventually after a bottleneck the risks of mutation from inbreeding even out to normal levels. But the lack of genetic diversity is the real threat to the species. If a virus comes in or a climate shift happens it can lead to complete extinction very quickly</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&quot;And unfortunately, those are exactly the circumstances faced by cheetahs today. As a <a href="https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/glossary/glossary_popup.php?word=species" target="_blank">species</a>, cheetahs have famously low levels of genetic variation. This can probably be attributed to a population <a href="https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/glossary/glossary_popup.php?word=bottleneck" target="_blank">bottleneck</a> they experienced around 10,000 years ago, barely avoiding extinction at the end of the last ice age. However, the situation has worsened in modern times. Habitat encroachment and poaching have further reduce cheetah numbers, consequently snuffing out <em>even more</em> genetic variation and leaving cheetahs <em>even more</em> vulnerable to extinction. &quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An example of extreme inbreeding would be the Thoroughbred horse breed (racehorses). The breed originated from only three sires (males) and less than 50 foundation mares (females). The level of inbreeding in these horses is insane and there is very little variation within the species due to every horse being descended from the three sires. Even with this extreme inbreeding though there is very little negative effects in the thoroughbred horses as the majority of deleterious genes have been bred out of the line. In all honesty the worst thing about it is that the inbreeding has led to the mares having higher rates of having twins which in the horse industry is a pretty big negative.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
