		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is kind of hard to answer because the question is probably somewhat more philosophical than you intended it to be.</p>
<p>Consider the following questions. Are you your personality? Are your thoughts part of you or something you do? If your thoughts are part of you, what about your impulses? What about sensations, is hunger part of you or is hunger something that describes you? What about touch, is the part of you that feels the computer you're typing on you or is it something you do?</p>
<p>Depending on how you answer those questions &quot;you&quot; could be somewhere between a fraction of your brain, and your entire body. I lean towards the entire body description but I think the most popular answer would probably be most or all of the brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no specific spot on which consciousness resides, or at least not one that scientists are able to determine. In fact, we don't even know why or how anesthesia works. When you have surgery, all the regions in your brain that process specific signals, such as vision, hearing, pain etc. still work.</p>
<p>It's just that anesthesia 'breaks' this connection between those regions, and somehow blacks out consciousness. As soon as those regions are able to communicate with each other once again, you start to regain consciousness.</p>
<p>So, consciousness seems to somehow emerge out of this orchestrated feedback of signals between various parts of your brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're really curious, I'd recommend reading &quot;consciousness explained&quot; by Daniel Dennett.</p>
<p>His answer, so far as I recall, is that it (the ego, the inner &quot;I&quot;') is something of an illusion. It's not a fixed point, but a phenomenon distributed over many parts over the brain, generated as they communicate with one another over time. Some bits are fully autonomic, and we never feel aware of them, but fundamentally there's an error in expecting a &quot;real&quot; unitary entity to be moving around in there. There is no unified &quot;I&quot;. It's not like an inner observer shines a spotlight on certain bits of the brain as they become active, for example.</p>
<p>...also be aware that his book is sometimes referred to as &quot;consciousness explained away&quot;, and a lot of people find his answers unsatisfying. I liked them, but I left philosophy before the postgrad level so my opinion is likely quite naive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
