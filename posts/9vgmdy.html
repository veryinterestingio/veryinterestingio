		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quoting this fantastic comment posted by /u/pixel_of_moral_decay in <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9ntph5/flight_attendants_what_are_some_things_we_as/e7p66ni/" target="_blank">this thread a few weeks ago</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ashtray is actually one of my favorite engineering bits on an airplane.</p>
<p>The design parameters for aviation all center around one thing: redundancy. If something fails, you don't want it to cause a problem. That's why planes are designed to be able to fly if an engine fails (ETOPS), there's secondary hydraulics (you'll lose functionality, but not enough to crash), there's secondary everything. Landing gear doesn't deploy? It can drop with gravity. Electrical goes out? Ram Air Turbine (RAT)! Every thing critical to flight and safety has an alternative. You're effectively flying a plane inside a plane, but don't realize it.</p>
<p>The ashtray follows that engineering mantra perfectly. The primary method of avoiding fire is to not have cigarettes and open flames in the cabin. The secondary method is to not have flammable materials in the cabin when possible and things like an ashtray, so if someone does light up, there's less of a risk of them causing a fire (like dropping it in the trash with all the tissues). There's also smoke detectors for early detection and fire extinguishers.</p>
<p>Even something as mundane as a no smoking policy is engineered with the thinking &quot;what if our primary defense doesn't work?&quot;</p>
<p>Brilliant when you think about it. Even the smallest detail like that is thought about, and the solution is simplistic, which is the best kind of solution for an engineering problem when safety is involved.</p>
<p>That's why an airline can't take off without an ashtray in the lavatory. They will actually delay a flight over it. It's a redundancy and another thing to make flying safer.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who works for an aircraft lav company, I can explain it. </p>
<p>Just because smoking on an aircraft is not allowed doesn't mean it doesn't happen.  Also, those planes fly all over the world, and some countries are not as forceful about smoking bans as others.  </p>
<p>Second, the lavatory has an ashtray because a butt thrown into the toilet may not be extinguished.  An aircraft toilet uses very little water to rinse. It flushes through vacuum pressure between the fuselage and the outside air. Also, the bowl is made of plastic.  it's not going to burn, but it's not COMPLETELY fireproof. </p>
<p>Third, and most important, someone smoking in the lav killed 23 people in 1983. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Canada_Flight_797" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Canada_Flight_797</a></p>
<p>Since then, aircraft lavs have smoke detectors, oxygen masks, automatic fire extinguishers in the waste bins, and fire containment engineered waste bins. </p>
<p>Good thing, too, because there are still idiots out there.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to think it was cause plane toilet doors were really old but that doesn’t make a lot of sense so, I asked a flight crew member one time, she told me it’s there by law. In case a person DOES ignore the law, cabin crew need an approved container to put a cigarette in. I imagine it has to do with aircraft safety but also insurance. </p>
<p>As others have mentioned, flushing, and waste baskets aren’t built for the purpose of taking potentially hot ash. You’d have to be a special kind of idiot to put a cigarette butt in a bin full of paper towels but, there’s a lot of very special people out there.. and for some nicotine addicts, a 12+ hour flight is just too much.. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
