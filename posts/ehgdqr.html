		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's actually the same process they recommend you do at home just more sterile. They will use saline or distilled water to &quot;irrigate&quot; the wound, which is just a fancy term for wash out. If the foreign body is really embedded they may have to physically extract it with some forceps (tweezers) or other instruments, then they irrigate the wound. From there they apply antibiotic ointment or iodine around the wound and close it with bandages, sutures, staples, etc.; Whatever is as minimally invasive and still effective.</p>
<p>Tl;Dr it's the same process you do at home for something minor, just with more technical names and sterile tools.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the wound.</p>
<p>If it's a simple scrape, I'll take a stack of 4&quot;x4&quot; gauze, wet some of it with saline and rub the wound. It hurts, unfortunately, but the rubbing helps scrape away big pieces of dirt, gravel etc. It also makes the wound bleed a little, which helps push out smaller debris. Then very lightly scrub with mild soap and water, bandage to control any extra bleeding/oozing.</p>
<p>If it's a cut or a deep scrape then I'll do something similar to the above, but with less active rubbing and more direct irrigation. I'll have a liter of saline solution in a bottle with a special cap on the end that allows me to spray a thin but pressurized stream of water directly into the wound with a protective splash guard to prevent blood/gunk getting everywhere.  Pressure and volume are important, \~5-8 PSI is sufficient to remove most debris and a liter is typically good enough to really flush out the bad stuff.</p>
<p>If it's an open fracture, then you're coming back to the operating room where we'll open the affected area surgically and do what's called a washout. Typically that'll be 3-5 liters of warm normal saline, not too dissimilar from the above, just a greater quantity and with surgical exploration. Other interventions will happen then too, of course, to address the fracture.</p>
<p>If it's a massive scrape with significant surface tissue loss that exposes bone, we'll do the above surgical 3-5 liter washout with wound exploration plus we'll put in something called a wound vac. This is sterile sponge material packed into the wound and sealed in with a plastic adhesive covering and a 1 way valve that can be hooked up to suction. That'll help speed and promote healing until a graft can be done with healthy tissue.</p>
<p>And then of course are antibiotics and tetanus shots as indicated. Antibiotics are usually reserved for more severe cases, but there are some exceptions like puncture wounds that extend through boot soles etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>“The solution to pollution is dilution.” You have to flush the wound with lots of fluids. This is true for superficial cuts, abdominal surgery, etc. </p>
<p>Also antibiotics, and potentially debridement surgery depending on how severe and what type of trauma has occurred.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They can do a debridement operation utilizing anesthesia if the debris invasion is severe enough. If not they may utilize irrigation of normal saline and suction. The patient will also be prescribed antibiotics if infection is a concern. Stitches will be performed to promote healing of the tissue underneath and to close the wound as to not allow further debris entry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Really though, we don't.</p>
<p>We get out the larger stuff. Smaller particles often get embedded and cannot be physically removed. The body will push these out secondarily. We try and minimize chance of infection, however.</p>
<p>Larger embedded particles will be referred to a surgeon if necessary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
