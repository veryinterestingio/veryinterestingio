		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>chips used to be just 2 dimensional.  The structure was called MOSFET. The node size was the gate length.</p>
<p>The transistor was then reinvented as FINFET.  From that point on, the node size became a marketing term.  10nm means:  &quot;This process is as efficient as 10nm MOSFET would be&quot;,  but in reality, the structures are much bigger.</p>
<p>In this 2 nm process, there is nothing physical that measures 2nm,  not even close. The structures are just as big as they were before.  And yet, they are able to pack a lot more transistors per square millimeter than ever before.  How do they do it?</p>
<p>They use a new structure called Gate All Around,  in which many transistors are stacked on top of each other,  vertically.  Look at this picture:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/media-1304795-gaa-fet-500.png" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/media-1304795-gaa-fet-500.png" target="_blank">https://www.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/media-1304795-gaa-fet-500.png</a></a></p>
<p>the ovals in the little towers are the nanowires that connect the source and drain of the transistor, the stuff around them is the gate, which is significantly bigger than 2nm.</p>
<p>So effectively this chip is as efficient as 2nm MOSFET would be,  but there is no such thing.</p>
<p>watch this video to understand the differences between MOSFET, FINFET, and GAAFET:</p>

<p>bottom line: there is nothing in the 2nm process from IBM that measures 2nm or even close.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Practically nothing on this chip measures 2nm - that measurement is barely within the error bounds for overlay accuracy. </p>
<p>The claimed gate length is about as short as it's likely to go for some time but that's still 12nm. The expected gate length for the &quot;3nm&quot; process is around 16nm. Things like the distances between transistors are some way larger than that, on the order of 30nm. </p>
<p>It's small but no that small. What's happened is that foundries have extrapolated from when these node numbers actually meant something because effective transistor density has increased at each step by reducing the space between them, but that's been by doing things like reworking how the transistors are wired up to each other (contact over active gate and self-aligned processes for forming the contacts) and making the transistors narrower (fin removal in the case of finFETs). The nanosheet gives you a potential extra push on this because you're stacking some things on top of each other to save some extra space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's important to realize that process node numbers (2nm, 5nm, 7 nm, etc.) don't actually refer to the size of the transistors. Process node numbers reflect more the <em>generation</em> of the technology, like 3G, 4G, 5G in cellphones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quantum effects always exist. Quantum &quot;noise&quot; in the Signal to Noise equation is detectable and present all the way from 0.13 or 130nm process, it's just that it's not highly influential. They could have used field effect transistors, multigate transistors, longer gates(remember 2nm refers to the technological square step of a minimal feature size, not actual functional element size).</p>
<p>The difficulties with smaller processes is lower yield. Top-tier process yields can be as low as 36% - that is only 36 percent of the circuits being usable due to manufacturing defects. So far we have seen nothing about their yield.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
