		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nope. Livers are different among different species, and not all species can process ethanol equally.</p>
<p>The human liver produces and enzyme called ADH4 which breaks down alcohol.  Most primates have the same enzyme, but Orangutans have a different version.  Humans can digest ethanol 50 times more efficiently than orangutans. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-02/chemist-re-enacts-evolution-alcohol-metabolism/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-02/chemist-re-enacts-evolution-alcohol-metabolism/" target="_blank">https://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-02/chemist-re-enacts-evolution-alcohol-metabolism/</a></a> </p>
<p>And the further we get from primates the more differences there are in livers.  The shark, for instance, uses their liver to store oil and fat to help them maintain buoyancy.  If a human liver stores too much fat then cirrhosis develops and the human dies.</p>
<p>Polar Bears store so much vitamin A in their livers that it would be lethal for a human to eat it.</p>
<p>And there are other animals that process ethanol better than humans.  Surprisingly, the smaller the animal the higher it's alcohol tolerance: <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/2/100209-drunk-bats-fly/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/2/100209-drunk-bats-fly/" target="_blank">https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/2/100209-drunk-bats-fly/</a></a> </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're getting some great answers, but one thing to add here is that not even all <em>humans</em> have livers that process ethanol the same way. Notably, a pretty large segment of the population has ALDH2 deficiency, which leads to a much lower clearance rate and much higher chance of acute toxicity at a given intake relative to an individual with ALDH2 sufficiency.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALDH2" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALDH2</a></p>
<p>Given the variance there is even within our species, it's unsurprising to see the larger variations across big taxonomic units. Small amounts of alcohol are prevalent across biochemistry for all sorts of processes and so it's going to be very common for <em>some</em> level of metabolic elimination to exist, but humans are definitely on the higher end relative to many other animals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm currently reading Amy Stewart's &quot;Drunken Botanist&quot; for the third time or so, and she mentions classic historical tales of animals becoming drunk.  Most were made up, as something like an elephant would need 350lbs of a certain plant to become intoxicated, but she noted that specific types of parrots in South America would become intoxicated on naturally fermenting fruit and become unable to fly.  Wildlife professionals had to care for the drunken, temporarily-flightless birds as they were prime targets for predators.  Great book - I highly recommend it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Side question, what percentage of ethanol does fallen fruit contain? Beer is typically 4.5% ABV but the strongest alcohol is almost 70% ABV. I'm sure most fruit cannot reach that % unless put under specific circumstances.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
