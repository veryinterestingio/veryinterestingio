Now i can somewhat understand how fast moving molecules can damage cells, but what causes the skin cells to be damaged after being in contact with slowly moving molecules? Does the water in cells and blood freeze? If so what happens to the frozen cell when thawing?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The slow moving molecules in contact with your skin steal the kinetic energy of the relatively fast moving molecules of your skin. This slows down the movement of the molecules in your skin. When those skin molecules get too slow, the liquid water within the cells freeze into ice, rupturing the cell.</p>
<p>On the other hand, fast-moving (hot) molecules in contact with skin transfer kinetic energy to your skin molecules, making your skin molecules vibrate faster. If the skin molecules vibrate too fast, the liquid water within the cell can phase change into steam which will rupture the cell (among other things).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the crystallization of water, freezing changes protein folding and lipid binding. The central dogma of life is that DNA codes for protein synthesis, proteins then catalyze chemical reactions. Proteins are long streaks of amino acids that are then &quot;folded&quot; into whatever shape they need to be in to do their job. The classic example is that a key has to be the exact right shape to turn the tumblers in a lock--if you change its shape the key won't open the lock. Same for proteins. Changes in temperature or pH cause proteins to unfold or bunch up more tightly (that's what we do when we cook meat). So every single process in the cells halts. Then the proteins don't automatically go back to the same shape when the temperature rises again, bc the microenvironment around each protein has changed. </p>
<p>To top that off, the lipid bilayers-the external, nuclear, and those surrounding other internal organelles-are in constant flux. Freezing stops that movement, making them hard and brittle instead of soft and flexible, so they would be easy to shatter even without the ice crystals. Moreover, as the various proteins in the outer membrane change shape, they would probably create holes in the membrane that don't self-heal as would normally happen because the lipid membrane isn't fluid. So the internal cell contents would be leaking from multiple places on each cell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The damage is very similar because in both heat burns and cold burns the mechanism is that the cells rupture. Freezer burns happen because ice crystals form inside the cells and pop the cellular membrane, or form extra-cellular and the sharp edges rupture the cellular membranes.</p>
<p>Heat causes cellular damage by destabilizing the lipid membranes, which are basically a type of oil wrapped around the watery cellular fluid like a bubble, so the cellular membrane pops...</p>
<p>Hence, very similar effects, for different causes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You get 2 injuries from frost bite.</p>
<p>The first is from the disruption of your skin and other tissues because of the fluid between your cells freezing.  The second is because upon rewarming, those areas have damage done to their blood vessels which leads to your platelets aggregating and coagulating inappropriately and leading to poor blood flow to the area making it die off.  Of course your also at risk of further injury because as your cells die, you mount an immune response to clean it up and that can cause further cells to be damaged and further clotting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
