		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Telemarketers (legitimate or not) use what's called a predictive dialer. The most common one is called ViciDial <a href="https://www.vicidial.com/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.vicidial.com/" target="_blank">https://www.vicidial.com/</a></a>. There is a pool of telemarketing agents calling a long list of numbers through this dialer. The dialer is called predictive because it constantly sets its dial level (amount of calls it places per second) based on how many telemarketers and the answer rates. So let's say there are a hundred telemarketers, if the human live answer rate is 33.3% it needs to make 300 calls to keep all the telemarketers busy. (I am way over simplifying, programs like Vici account for average telemarketer conversation time and much more). The idea is to make enough calls to keep all the agent busy without over or under dialing. The problem becomes that the answer rate sometimes varies. For example, answer rates will spike around noon and 5pm local time as people get a break from work and can answer the phone.   </p>
<p>When this happens the dialer is left with more calls than agents while it adjusts to the new answer rate and the dialer is trying to find an agent to take that call during that silence. If nobody ever answers it's because it didn't find anyone available. This is the tell-tale mark of a predictive dialer or ATDS as it's called (automated telephone dialing system) which is now illegal to use for unsolicited calls. A properly (and legally) configured ATDS is supposed to play you a message and place you on hold while it looks for an agent to take your call, but none of these guys ever do that since the law is unenforceable as they operate offshore and it's cheaper to just dump the call after X amount of time.  </p>
<p>You should know that these dialers have the ability to place millions of calls per hour and the settings reflect the costs in aggregate of those calls.</p>
<p>These applications have sophisticated AMD (answering machine detection) built in that can accurately determine if there is a voicemail. They make calls at such a high rate that not detecting voicemails can get very expensive since the telemarketing outfit pays per minute. The dialers are programmed to hangup when they have a positive match for AMD. AMD works in a few ways but mostly by listening for silence duration and pattern after the call is answered. AMD makes that silence you hear worse because it's the system trying to get a read on whether you're human or not.   </p>
<p>Some comments say that they are strictly trying to detect what numbers in a series are active. This is partially true. Usually a telemarketing operation that dials sequentially (war-dialing as it's called) will still pitch services because it's expensive to just war-dial numbers and not yield anything from it. Even if a list is 99% dead numbers you need to consider that because of the predictive nature of these applications they can easily just increase the dial-level. After a single pass they have instant data as what numbers are live and which aren't so the second pass is much more efficient and the dial level can be set much lower. It costs the telemarketer no money to call dead numbers as they pay for airtime, not per call placed.  </p>
<p>People say to just not answer the phone but that doesn't help either. The reason is because you number will be identified as live either by you or your voicemail. One way or another the call is being answered and so therefore it must be valid and it will be called again.  </p>
<p>If you're looking to block spam calls there isn't much you can do. Honestly, the best bet is to get a Google Pixel with built in call screening. That is hands down the best defense. Secondly there are apps like NoMoRobo our there but these are easily defeated. Telemarketers just purchase DID's (caller id numbers called direct inbound dials) by the thousands which is more that can be reported to these systems before they are rendered ineffective and blocked by the mobile application.   </p>
<p>We should see a dramatic change in July (i think) as Shaken Not Stirred goes into effect to try and solve this problem, but we shall see. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STIR/SHAKEN" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STIR/SHAKEN" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STIR/SHAKEN</a></a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's also a scam where the caller hangs up quickly, or after a few seconds. So you have a missed call show up in your call list. The idea is that this would cause the receiver to call back. But the number you're calling back to is a pay line, so you get charged a certain amount and they get the money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know this is a lot easier said than done and I very much lucked into this. But if you can, get a number that is NOT in your area code. Sign up when you visit somewhere for work/vacation or whatever. I've had the same number since I was 16 but have long ago moved across the state.</p>
<p>Spam callers usually show up on your caller ID as (your area code)-(your prefix)-(random numbers).</p>
<p>So I live in one area code, my number's in another. If I get a call from my number's area code I immediately ignore. Because it's almost a guarantee to be spam. No one would be calling me from my number's area code. I don't live there. I don't know anyone there except my mom. Sure, I still have to click ignore, and it would be a greater convenience if they just stopped calling. But since that doesn't seem to be possible knowing when to ignore is the next best thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what others have said (list validation), one other answer is that your’s isn’t the only number being called. Spammers have their calls ignored so often that they’d waste too much of their own time dialing numbers if they did it one at a time. So they’ll dial, say, 10 numbers at once (using VOIP software) and the first unfortunate person to answer their phone gets connected to the spammer. If you answer and there’s no one on the other end, it might mean that someone else answered the call more quickly than you did.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
