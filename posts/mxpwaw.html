		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When hearing a song for the first time what is the thing that decides if we like it or not? Most people enjoy a limited amount of genre but can vibe to a random song that's something totally different, how does that work? And why are we enjoying songs from the same genre often? Is it some kind of brain stimulation?</p>
<p>Sure it can be something like nostalgia but besides that.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Musician/composer here. I feel like a lot of these answers here are just guesses of why there’s different taste in music, rather than the proven explanation.</p>
<p>In psychology, there’s a trait known as the mere exposure effect: When an individual is exposed to a stimulus (music, film, food, etc.) repeatedly over time, that individual likes it more after experiencing it over and over again, than just the first time. Even if they disliked the stimulus the first few times.</p>
<p>So rather than explaining the complex differences in genres here, I’ll make an analogy to music using food. Each genre is like a different regional style of cooking; BBQ, Italian, Cajun, etc. etc. Yes there’s individual differences between individual dishes within these broader categories, but food within one of these categories will be similar to other dishes in the same category. Like individual songs/pieces in a larger genre.</p>
<p>Someone who grew up in a place where say, BBQ, is eaten frequently, will probably really like BBQ food, as that’s what they grew up with. (Mere exposure effect at play.) Now let’s say that person moves to a different town when they get older, that Cajun is really popular in. The different spices, sauces, types of dishes and more may be too different for that person to like, but maybe a specific dish or two taste alright. </p>
<p>Due to the mere exposure effect, that person will like that specific dish more and more, as they get used to the different ingredients and learn what to expect; they may even branch out to more Cajun dishes!!</p>
<p>This is just like music and other experience we have during our lives. The more familiar you are with it, the more you tend to like it. Like food, music has many different styles, and some are more similar to others. Being familiar with a genre tends to let you ‘understand’ (using this term loosely) a new-to-you song that fits that genre, better than someone who never has heard that genre. And so you will probably like it, while the other may not.</p>
<p>There are so many different genres, sub-genres, artists, composers, bands, instruments, and musical systems across the world, that it is likely you are only exposed to a small handful compared to the larger picture. Others may be only exposed to a completely different handful. This is what leads to our different musical tastes. And in a way, you can ‘learn’ to like a genre or piece by using the mere exposure effect, by listening to it several times.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I dont think there is an ELI5 answer. I mean have you noticed literally everyone has different tastes in music? I'm an identical triplet who is a former music teacher and all three of us have very different tastes despite the fact that we are genetically identical and spent the first 18 years in the same house. I'm also the only one who studied music.</p>
<p>I tend to think the opposite of a lot of the comments here. A lot of the music I like is because it breaks expectations. So from a personal and cultural perspective nobody agrees on everything or maybe even anything.</p>
<p>From a purely mathematical reason the fact that sound is a wave does matter. If you've ever noticed that two instruments playing out of tune don't just sound bad; you can actually hear the conflicting waves almost fighting with each other. It sounds like beats (this is essentially where the waves briefly clash and cancel each other out).</p>
<p>Most cultures avoid having waves that clash with each other. Most cultures still have dissonant intervals but in western music they're a means to drive things forward. They need resolving to a more pleasant group of notes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>i dont really have the expertise to comment on the whole question, but it is thought that the pleasure we get from music comes from a sort of Reward system, from within the brain. Your brain guesses where the song will go next, and if it is right, it will reward itslef with dopamine, similarly to why we find jokes funny, but in that case, it's the brain being surprised by a completely different outcome, that triggers dopamine secretion.
I'm sure musical taste has a lot to do with pattern recognition as well, but like I said, I'm no expert :).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert, but my favorite explanation of what music is is a solution without a problem.  I've heard there's a lot of overlap between math and music and so listening to a song is similar to solving a puzzle only you don't have to think to come up with the answer.</p>
<p>My theory is that depending on your own personal mental &quot;structure&quot;, you need a different &quot;formula&quot; from everyone else that resonates best with you.  And the more music you listen to, the more complicated and unique this formula needs to be to bring you the same satisfaction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
