The deepest hole is about 12 km and the earth is &gt;6000 km is size, so we have only drilled a small percentage of the distance.    This does not guarantee that the core is a particular temperature, but any model that has a cooler outside, and warmer as you go down means that there is some sort of heat flowing out. </p>
<p>The temp at the bottom of the hole was 180C (356F).  See <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190503-the-deepest-hole-we-have-ever-dug" target="_blank">this article</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a good question, the answer to which (exactly how hot is the core?) is not precisely known and con't be measured with current technology.</p>
<p>However, it is hot by all reckoning (4000K - 7000K).  The simplest explanation proceeds from the assertion that the outer core of the earth is liquid FeNi. At the pressure of the core, for FeNi to be liquid is has to be very hot. Why is in inferred the outer core is liquid one may ask. The explanation for which is acoustic tomography, using the paths of sound waves through the earth to define composition.</p>
<p>A good description of the details can be found in this 1997 Scientific America article: <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-is-the-earths-core-so/" target="_blank">Why is the earth's core so hot? And how do scientists measure its temperature?</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If it weren't, the outer areas would also have cooled down by now. It's quite hard to have cold on the inside, hot at the edge and cold in the outside. That would require that the area beneath the crust heats up by some process, but that same process would also heat up the core. There is no way this can stay like this for long due to simple thermodynamics: where does the heat of the core go?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer your question regarding mid-layer vs core, we know that the core is hot because of heat flow and geometry.</p>
<p>Conservation of energy says that energy isn't just going to disappear - and there isn't some magic portal at the center of the earth that siphons away heat and keeps it cold. Meanwhile, temperature flows from areas that are hot, to areas that are cold.  It will always do that - heat flows.  Insulation will change how rapidly that happens, but it won't stop it or reverse it.  Anything in contact with anything else will begin to transfer heat until they're equal in temperature.</p>
<p>Now if we image the earth to have an icy-cold core, and a super-hot midlayer, that's fine as a snapshot.  But if we start from there and then let the Earth sit for the <em>4 billion years</em> Earth has been around, the heat from the hot mid-layer would slowly flow to the icy core and heat it up.</p>
<p>Unless there was something siphoning away the heat from the core, a hot midlayer <em>necessitates</em> a hot core once a long time has passed and the system has reached 'steady-state'.  That is, a state where things are staying relatively constant and consistent because all the different contributors have reached a balance point.</p>
<p>Now, the Earth is radiating out heat into space, while receiving heat from the radiation from the Sun, as well as tidal forces from the Sun and the Moon.  In addition, it is receiving heat from the decay of radioactive materials - particularly Uranium and Thorium (and their daughter products) decaying in the earth.</p>
<p>So, to put it simply: even if we start with a</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cold-hot-cold   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>model of Earth, as we go from surface to mid-layer to core, and let it sit for a long time, it will eventually become</p>
<blockquote>
<p>warm-warm-warm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Add on top of that that the planet is losing heat to space and is gaining it internally, it's like sticking an ice pack at one end and a heater in between the layers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Cold</strong>-warm-<strong>Hot</strong>-warm-<strong>Hot</strong>-warm  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>will become:    </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Cold</strong>-cool-<strong>Hot</strong>-warm-<strong>Hot</strong>-hot</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it's actually more or less inevitable that the core of the Earth, or any sphere at any scale that produces heat internally, and loses it at its surface, will be hottest at its center.  Just because after sitting around for a while, the center isn't going to be <em>colder</em> than any other part of it, and the closer any part is to the surface, the more it will be losing heat. [Or rather, it will lose heat at the same rate, while being at a colder temperature, thus maintaining the difference in temperatures.]</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chemical Engineer here: If the Earth is giving off heat (independently of the sun) the heat has to come from somewhere. If we assume the Earth is old then we can assume we are at &quot;quasi steady state&quot; where heat goes from a hot object to a cold object. Geological models involving radioactive materials, magnetic materials and pressure and temperature profiles are details.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
