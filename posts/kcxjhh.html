		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Ph.D. in Vaccine Development here.</strong><br />
Short answer: Many many reasons<br />
Slightly longer answer: </p>
<ul>
<li>Combination of impact and design difficulty - Understandably, vaccines were developed for the most common/most impactful diseases (the need) + a combination of how easy/straightforward it was to design the vaccine, based on what we knew about the pathogen, its structure, the immunodominant antigen, and most importantly the correlate of protection. So you could think that a lot of the impactful diseases, that have the advantage of straightforward design - e.g. low mutation ability, limited immunodominant antigens, clear correlates of protection, e.g. antibodies have been addressed - Rotavirus, pneumococcal pneumonia, Measles, Mumps, Rubella, etc. etc. </li>
<li>Others are ones that have high impact but pose considerable scientific challenges - Flu, HIV etc. There's been lots of work and $ put into them but their high mutation rates mean they are scientifically hard to crack. That's why while we have *generally effective* flu vaccines, we still need to rely on strain coverage and annual seleciton. We've been making steady progress towards a universal flu vaccine, but it's still a while away. For e.g. for flu, we know the correlate of protection, but don't have a stable/conserved immunodominant antigen yet... for HIV - mix of both, some potential immunodominant antigens, but the high mutation rate is a fucking nightmare. RSV is similar - there has been a lot of interest due to the high impact, but the concern is scientific (antigen selection and immune response) than lack of resources </li>
<li>Then there is the need aspect, in the other direction - Vaccine development is expensive, and takes time. So you need resources, and in current society - conpanies investing in this need to recoup their costs - so this goes into the argument on funding. Someone else in this thread brought up chikungunya - Yep, decent example - mostly a disease affecting developing countries, but other than a few labs, and a few startups focuisng on emerging diseases, there wasn't that much effort in there - from the U.S. side - till recently. It has been in development in other countries, but like I said, this takes time.... and resources </li>
<li>mRNA vaccine tech - This tech has been in development for the last 18 years or so. It is not new! The problem is, as most of the &quot;easy&quot; targets were taken up by other vaccines as mentioned earlier - they had a higher bar to prove. For a new tech, they need to convince regulators, that their vaccine is as good/better than established ones, as opposed to just proving they work. Plus the cold chain concerns etc. are a factor. But the key advantage for them was always the speed of reactivity - Once a pathogen is identified/sequenced, it's much quicker to design an mRNA vaccine than a protein/live inactivated etc. so companies like Novavax, Moderna, Biontech have been working on mRNA vaccines for a while as the USP is ability to react quickly to novel antigens - as what happened here. </li>
<li>This is a litmus test for new vaccine tech, and it will be fascinating to see where we go from here. As this tech takes center stage, we can expect more investment in this tech for other diseases.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>HIV is a highly mutagenic virus - there are a handful of different COVID strains circulating around the world, but in HIV the virus continues to mutate readily after infection, leading to the presence of multiple strains per individual <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00163230" target="_blank">(source)</a>. This makes it a much more difficult task to come up with an effective vaccine for HIV.</p>
<p>As for the others, its more of an economic reason than a biological one. The scale of the COVID pandemic has caused governments and industry worldwide to pour money into the development of a vaccine -- and that level of demand just isn't there for RSV/EBV/etc. Would love for someone with more of a background in healthcare economics to chime in here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The Moderna vaccine has been in development since 2013 for a different strain of coronavirus; they reworked it. Here's a video from the MIT course on the pandemic from one of the researchers who made the vaccine, Kizzmekia Corbett.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpqfdr9FPWM&amp;feature=emb_logo" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpqfdr9FPWM&feature=emb\_logo" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpqfdr9FPWM&feature=emb\_logo</a></a> The MIT course also has other researchers (one studies HIV) who discusses how and why there is no vaccine for HIV because how quickly it mutates.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a huge reason why the Covid vaccine was able to be developed so quickly that I disturbingly don't see in other responses.</p>
<p>For vaccine approval, efficacy must be proved. When the incidence of a disease is low, this takes a much much longer time to prove. When the incidence of a disease is high, a vaccine can prove efficacy much more quickly. (It should be noted that incidence and prevalence are close to equal in Covid-19). </p>
<p>The 3 MAJOR reasons the vaccine has come out so quickly:</p>
<p>1) Covid-19 had a high incidence world-wide
2) Covid-19 has a low mutation rate
3) Covid-19 has no 100% effective prevention</p>
<p>Yes, affecting countries with more financial power is contributing, but that is not the primary reason.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
