		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Language acquisition is the study of how people learn language, especially at a young age. </p>
<p>In general the more that a child encounters language spoken by people to other people, the more they'll learn. They can learn from adults speaking to them directly, other children speaking with them, and even other adults and children talking to one another. (They <em>don't</em> seem to learn as well from videos of people.)</p>
<p>I'm curious to know the studies you're citing, because how you measure matters, the environment matters, and some kids are slower or quicker learners. (When comparing unique individuals, the individual may have more impact than the environment, it's just hard to say.)</p>
<p>If you're just talking about a child A with their parents, and a child B with their extended family, it's possible that B will be exposed to more kinds language between other family members and will see <strong>examples of different registers</strong> - adult to child, child to adult, adult to adult, and child to child. A is primarily exposed to adult to child and may see adult to adult, but not have examples of child to adult or child to child. (Though they'll likely pick it up later, in school or at playdates.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's much more complicated than that. </p>
<p>There are a lot of factors that come in to play - just off the top of my head (and not a comprehensive list):</p>
<ul>
<li>the quality of the interactions between parent and child, and child and the other children and adults in that child's life (the quantity of interactions is important too, but overall the quality is more important, because when abuse is in the picture, children tend to withdraw and may even stop speaking)</li>
<li>the diction employed by the parents in both the parent's everyday interactions and in interactions with the child (diction is not pronunciation. diction is the used vocabulary. you might have a vocabulary of 30,000 words, but you might only use 5,000 of them regularly. that is diction)</li>
<li>how much the parents/adults read to the child</li>
<li>any disabilities the child may have (hearing problems, speech/mouth problems, neurotypical divergence, etc). </li>
<li>the child's early learning style preference (some kids are just not verbal or not verbally gifted; kinesthetic kids)</li>
</ul>
<p>--<br />
If you're really interested in the topic, there are Normal Language Acquisition classes, usually in your Communications Disorders department at universities. This field may help you as a teacher if you want to know more about children with speech and language processing difficulties (which many disorders have some form of these).<br />
((i'm a linguist with a little background in speech disorders/communication disorders, oriented toward second language acquisition and teaching English as a foreign language. please forgive what i've forgotten as i took NLangAcq over 12 years ago!))</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Learning &quot;N&quot; number of words and &quot;learning rate %&quot; aren't very useful metrics for studying multi-lingual language acquisition in young children.  Most studies will parameterize &quot;fluency&quot; - the point at which a child's mastery of the language is effectively indistinguishable from an adult's in terms of the complexity of the sentences they form.</p>
<p>The studies that I've read usually define fluency in terms of the error rate in sentence construction in the target grammar.  For multi-lingual speakers, studies will probably focus on the error rate of each language.</p>
<p>For example, if language A does not allow for a speaker to have null subjects, a speaker who has null subjects in his or her sentences at a rate above some % would not be considered fluent.  Once the error rate drops below some threshold, that speaker would be said to have acquired adult fluency.</p>
<p>For children exposed to multiple languages, they will remain non-fluent in each language for a longer period of time compared to a mono-lingual speaker in each language until they have differentiated each of the target grammars.</p>
<p>A example of this using your question.</p>
<p>Child A is exposed to only language 1 and acquires adult fluency by age 4 in language 1.</p>
<p>Child B is exposed to language 1, 2, and 3 (minimal) from multi-lingual family and attains adult fluency in language 1 at age 5 (one year later than Child A), language 2 at age 4 (let's say due to increased exposure compared to exposure to language 1), but never attains adult fluency of language 3 due to lack of exposure (once a month when spending time with grandma who is the only speaker of language 3 on family).</p>
<p>Generally, the &quot;critical period&quot; in which children are most open to language acquisition is between 2-6 for acquiring what linguists refer to as &quot;native speaker fluency&quot;.  Some argue that the way a speaker of a language encodes said language is different when the language is acquired in early childhood vs. acquired in adulthood, which is the distinction between a adult fluency and native speaker fluency, though this is debated since it can't be &quot;measured&quot; reliably/in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>Not saying your textbook is wrong, but it's a less than precise way of describing the way children learn languages.</p>
<p>As a disclaimer, my response is based on research that is at least 10 years old, and so it is arguably dated.  Take what I have to say with a grain of salt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
