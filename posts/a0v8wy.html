		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an expert in spider vision <em>at all</em> but I do like to read about it, so I'll tell what I know:</p>
<p>Many/most spiders have two types of eyes, primary and secondary; the primary eyes are usually the larger forward-facing ones (like in jumping or wolf spiders) and they are generally better at image-forming; the secondary eyes are the simpler eyes that extend around the edges of the spider's body - they are less good for image perception, better for movement or brightness perception. The fields of view for each of these eyes will overlap with one another at least partially, like the fields for your two eyes overlap.</p>
<p>These eyes are all wired into the spider's brain via optic tracts kind of like your optic nerves; these go to different targets in the spider's brain, but from there they converge on a structure called the 'arcuate body' that seems to be a higher-level visual area among other things. In the arcuate, information from multiple eyes and other senses begins to be integrated by lateral connections between different sub-areas.</p>
<p>So, it's reasonable to suppose that information from the spider's primary and secondary eyes is integrated in the spider's brain, and in whatever way a spider has visual experience - which is certainly inconceivable to us - it experiences all its eyes in a single integrated frame. I think you'd kind of need a reason to suppose that spider vision is <em>not</em> integrated.</p>
<p><em>edit</em></p>
<p>[this doctoral dissertation from a student at u mass amherst] (<a href="https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1632&context=dissertations_2" target="_blank">https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1632&context=dissertations_2</a>) seems like a great central resource for this kind of info, it seems better than most reviews I've looked at~~</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Entomologist here.  There's a lot of misconceptions about arthropod vision and how their eyes work i.e. the popular depiction of each eye seeing a distinct image or, in the case of compound eyes, <a href="https://shoutingattheclouds.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/images.jpg" target="_blank">each cell seeing a single image</a>.  Generally speaking, arthropods are capable of doing a fair amount of what you call image stitching, but because of the physiology a few quirks crop up.  </p>
<p>First, arthropods have multiple types of eyes.  Spiders generally have a pair primary eyes with movable retinas that have similar capacities to other more conventional eyes in nature.  Their secondary eyes have functions that vary by species; some are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17914649" target="_blank">adapted to low light vision</a>, some are <a href="http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/12/5/20160152" target="_blank">massively enlarged to detect small movements</a>, some even have <a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/05/150518-jumping-spider-color-vision-mating-animals-science/" target="_blank">filters that allow them to detect a broader spectrum of light than other spiders</a>.  The main point is that these secondary eyes aren't like &quot;bonus&quot; primary eyes; they often have a specific function at the cost of reduced visual acuity.  There are other classes of secondary eyes like this, particularly in insects.  The ocelli are small, simple light detecting eyes that are incapable of image formation, usually found in a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Polistes_ocelli.jpg/220px-Polistes_ocelli.jpg" target="_blank">triangular pattern on the head of flying insects</a>.  These eyes are used for orientation during flight; the ocelli will be faced towards the horizon, with the two on top aligned with the sky and the one on the bottom aligned with the ground.  There are also stemmata, which are like single cells of a compound eye split into their own mini-eye.  These are often found in immature insects, or in non-insect hexapods.  </p>
<p>Secondly, image stitching, insofar as I can call it such without invoking understanding of an insect's consciousness.  Most arthropod eyes are fixed in direction, and in many cases fixed in focal distance (although this is not the case for a spider's primary eyes).  Therefore, there is a certain amount of &quot;stitching&quot; in terms of combining their perception to react to their environment.  Each cell of an insect's compound eyes capture a narrow arc, around 1 degree, and it must combine visual information from many hundreds of these 1 degree arcs to have a comparable field of view to a more conventional eye.  Also, because each of these compound eye cells has a fixed focal distance, parts of objects may be in focus in part of the eye, but out of focus in another part of the eye, leading to overall poor visual acuity.  <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e9ef/676d41a8926d9a0809d23a2a9cce0ca75142.pdf" target="_blank">Here is a fantastic article on insect vision, and the limitations of simple arthropod eyes.</a>  Now, this system, believe it or not, has a lot of similarities to something like processing that's going on in the human eye.  In a human retina there are rod and cone cells that detect light, and these are often &quot;clustered&quot; in a way that they transmit information to the brain.  Detection of movement is done at least partially by edge detection; the &quot;dark&quot; edge of the object moves, changing what a given cluster of cells is detecting to a &quot;light&quot; background, and which clusters of cells are transitioning from dark to light indicates to your brain which way an object is moving.  Imagine this same thing, except instead of those clusters of rods and cones being adjacent to each other on the inside of the eye but relatively continuous, each cluster is locked to a cell of the compound eye and there's a much more discrete transition from one cluster to the next.  So the way the insects process these images are going to have some similarities, and they will integrate this data in with the other sensory inputs from things like the ocelli or secondary eyes in ways that are difficult for humans to conceptualize.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I can't speak to the cognitive state of arthropods, but I would hazard a guess that the image they form of the world is similar to ours, but more out of focus, with a wider variety of stimuli that they can sense, and overall much, much weirder.  </p>
<p>Finally, a slight digression into my favorite insect vision story.  The tiger beetle is a predatory insect that is an incredibly fast runner; the fastest can run at 5 miles an hour, which for a bug that is only 20 mm long is insane.  As this National Geographic article puts it, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/phenomena/2014/02/04/tiger-beetles-become-blind-when-they-run/" target="_blank">it would be like a human running 480 miles per hour</a>.  The problem?  It runs so fast that the sideways facing cells of its compound eyes can't gather enough light, and it's vision blurs around the periphery to the point where it's practically blind while running.  They've evolved a number of ways to compensate for this, such as using their antennae to detect obstacles and move around them, but honestly?  They're just so damn fast they're going to have their prey in their mouths before it can move, so they don't even need to see.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's important to note that humans don't just see one stitched together image. </p>
<p>Consciously, sure, you only see one image, say 150° horizontally and vertically. But in reality, your brain does all kinds of things to trick you. </p>
<p>First of all, we all know the blind spot experiment, where each eye has an area you literally can't see, but your brain corrects for this. Secondly, even though you think you see a wide field, the area you see clearly is only a tiny fraction of it. Everything outside of that is out of focus, but by moving your eyes, you can see that. </p>
<p>Ever notice how you can see things out of the corner of your eye better at night? That has to do with how rods and cones are distributed within your eye. </p>
<p>You can be sitting in a room staring at Reddit all day, but if there's movement in the corner, no matter how small, you'll notice it. Same goes for faces - why does this: </p>
<p>\ &gt;:( </p>
<p>look angry to us? Simply put, because our brain processes faces differently from other patterns. </p>
<p>So as much as we think we have some single picture, it's actually countless different parts of the eyes and brain working together. </p>
<p>As to spiders, as I understand it, they're all a bit different, but also have a more focused region at the front, and more light/movement sensitivity in all directions. </p>
<p>EDIT: angry face was sad looking. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
