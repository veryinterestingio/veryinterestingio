<p>Here in germany the highest court just cancelled our laws that ban &quot;active dying help&quot; saying everyone has a right for a death on his own terms.</p>
<p>&quot;Passive dying help&quot; was legal already. Wich is basically not limiting drugs that relieve pain even if it gets to deadly doses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I'm for voluntary euthanasia, but it is a tricky legal area, new laws have to be crafted with the outmost care.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi from the Netherlands here, it's euthanasia is legal here.</p>
<p>Okay so pets, they don't really know what's happening, or if they do they can't say so. Because they are not capable of saying &quot;hey living is worse than dieing at this point&quot;, it's up to us to say &quot;hey it's ok you don't have to hurt anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>For humans it's more complicated, we know what's happening and we can communicate about it. Here in the Netherlands you have to convince several doctors that your wish for euthanasia is legit. If they don't believe you're legit, no euthanasia for you. The complications come from our awareness of the circumstances, like for instance, someone might not want to be a burden. That's not a legit reason for euthanasia. But if living is too painful to bear, at least we can say so. </p>
<p>Seen in this way, euthanasia is actually more acceptable for humans than it is pets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's legal in some countries, I think the Netherlands and Switzerland, and there are many cases of people with terminal diseases traveling to those countries specifically to die on their own terms, rather than being forced to live out their last year's in chronic pain or having lost their mind to dementia etc. </p>
<p>The main issues are surrounding how well people can give consent, if you have terminal dementia for example you have to have given consent before you reach the stage when you have lost the ability to reason and remember, however it is precisely those stages that most people want to avoid and die beforehand.</p>
<p>There is an excellent documentary about it I would recommend to you called Choosing to Die, by the famous author Terry Pratchett, who was diagnosed with dementia in the last 10 years of his life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
