		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They use a special machine with a unique keyboard that allows them to type the rough phonetic spelling of the words they're hearing, which allows them to type much faster than your typical keyboard.  They type up their record after the day in court, in regular English, so that anyone can read it.</p>
<p>Also, court reporters can and do speak up when they missed something.  Unless it's something they can refer to later (like an uncommon or foreign name that they might not be sure about), they will ask the speakers to repeat themselves or speak up if needed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My mom was a stenographer so I can help</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The minimum speed for a license is 300 words per minute with less that one error per minute The average decent types can type at 60 words per minute with multiple errors. A really good QWERTY typist can hit 100 words per minute. So they are typing faster than people can talk. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They use a different keyboard. The way o understand it, you type by syllable’s. So the word STENOGRAPHER can be typed in 4 actions rather than 12 actions. They can also set macros for common words. If it was a law suit involving acetaminophen, they could make a shortcut to type it quickly. They can do this for names or other things. </p>
</li>
<li>They can ask for clarification during a trial. They don’t often need to. Also, it’s not shown in tv shows cause it’s not fun to watch even if accurate.</li>
</ol>
<p>Edit: for those who want to learn stenography to type faster for work, it’s not that easy. The layout is not the same and the way you type syllable’s is not easy to understand. The words “understand”would look like thrqu*gthy ( completely made up but the output look like gibberish before it’s converted to English. </p>
<p>Also there are keyboards designed to help you type faster. DVORAK is what I’ve heard of. It tries to be easier but spacing out letters efficiently. Again to do this you’d have to learn a new keyboard so it’s worth it in the long rub but I never wanted to learn</p>
<ol>
<li>They can mark words they don’t know how to spell to go back and look it up later</li>
</ol>
<p>Edit2: why is this the technique used for court reporting? It’s more cost efficient to store transcripts and share them this way. Also, text is easy to look up. If a lawyer wants to clarify what was said earlier during trial, it’s provides an easy way to look up the answer that is faster than a voice recording because you can read faster than people talk or the amount of time it would take to play back. </p>
<p>Also there is a big push in the industry to switch to voice typing. It still involves a court reporter but they would repeat the testimony, or closed captioning for tv.</p>
<p>Also for those interested, court reporting is a good career. It makes good many, you can hear interesting stories, if you transcribe depositions you can make extra money. Also, if you’re single you can always try to meet a lawyer or judge!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
