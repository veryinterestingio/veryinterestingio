		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth noting that there are multiple dating methods that overlap. As an example pulled from thin air, one method has a range of 10-400 years, one that's most accurate at 100-5000 years, one for 300-10000 years.  A sample dated 350 years ago by all 3 methods means the date is fairly well supported.  It also means that the methods are fairly reliable as well.  Now multiply this by hundreds of thousands or maybe even millions of samples, each corroborating together to increase the confidence by some amount.  Over the years, this builds a really high confidence in the methods.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There has been no recorded evidence that any physical constants have been inconstant during any time that matters on a geological or biological scale.</p>
<p>Your question, which concerns to two of the three fundamental forces of the universe, is equivalent to asking if time has ever varied or gravity turned off in the past...  If such things had happened, everything in the universe would be different.</p>
<p>Very long-lived radioactive elements that decay infrequently or very short-lived radioactive elements that only exist in minute quantities can both have relatively large error bars and low precision, because it can be hard to get enough decay events for good statistics.  However, there has never been any evidence that the half-lives actually changed from say 500 years to 450 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That threshold exists, but not because half-lives change. Radiocarbon dating is only useful up to around 50,000 years ago, after which the quantities of carbon-14 in a sample are generally so small that they canâ€™t be reliably measured. There are a variety of other dating methods that archaeologists, paleontologists, etc., use for things older than that threshold, including other radiometric dating methods that use different elements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Supernova light decay studies. Astronomers can observe supernovas at extreme distances, which also means they can observe them a various points in the past, extending back billions of years. While the light from the initial supernova blast doesn't tell us anything about radioactive decay, the supernova creates a large number of radioactive elements that have relatively short lifespans, as in minutes to months. We can observe the changing light patterns from the supernova, and measure the speed at which various radioactive elements are decaying out of that light curve. Radioactive decay rates of elements differ by element, but they all depend on the same fundamental physical constants, so a change in rate for one element would imply a change in rate of all elements. Because we can see the same decay curve at different points in history, we can establish that those physical constants are either unchanged over time, or the change is too small to be detected over billions of years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
