		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You might not be near a large body of water, but if the frogs decided to leave wherever they were living before, maybe it was over crowded, or there were too many predators, or they've just had to move on to look for food, they won't necessarily stay near a large body of water. They're going to find other backyard mini ponds, large birdbaths, muddy fields, drainage ditches, and move between them until they find what they want. They might even decide to hang around if it seems like a nice neighborhood to them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They were already hanging out pretty close by because there was a decent place for them to develop from eggs nearby.  So when they found a good place to make more babies, they hung out where you could see them. </p>
<p>Amphibians should be super common just about everywhere. Most amphibians have to use fish-free water to incubate their eggs but, as adults, lots of species live a long ways away from standing water.  If you make a puddle that seems to a frog like it will be there long enough for them to lay eggs in and the tadpoles develop, they will hang out there.  </p>
<p>Speaking generally, if you live in the United States and do not seasonally have an abundance of amphibians near your home, that likely indicates significant ecological disruption.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
