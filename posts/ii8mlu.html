		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Psychologist here.</p>
<p>Ok, so in your body there are two systems that work against one another: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system.</p>
<p>The sympathetic nervous system amps you up. It increases your heart rate, shuts down your digestion and decreases blood-flow to non-important areas of your brain. In extreme cases, this can lead to shock, by the way.</p>
<p>The parasympathetic nervous system does the opposite. It kicks in if there is no stressor around and relaxes you. The idea here is that your body can't run at full throttle all the time, otherwise you'd have a lot of wear and tear.</p>
<p>Now, how does this system kick in? There's a cool model, called the &quot;transactional stress model&quot;. It basically says that the stress response is determined by two factors: how dangerous you perceive a situation, and how many resources you perceive to have to deal with it. If a situation is not dangerous and you have a lot of resources, it wont be as stressful. The parasympathetic nervous system will kick in and your &quot;stress level&quot; decreases. (I'm simplyfiying A LOT here).</p>
<p>To help yourself relax you can...</p>
<p>A: Deal with stressors (finish tasks that stress you out)</p>
<p>B: Change your perception of the stressors (Is it really that dangerous? Is it really important?)</p>
<p>C: Change your perception of your available resources (for example: realize what people could help you, realize just how much time you have to deal with the issues at hand, etc.)</p>
<p>One thing proven to help with stress management is mindfulness meditation (for extreme cases see the mindfulness based stress reduction program). Mindfulness meditation can actually alter your brain structure to strengthen the parts that are important for emotion-control. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So to sum it up: your mind evaluates a situation and your body reacts to it. What you feel as stress (heart pumping, headaches, restlessness) is the reaction. By changing your perception, you change the reaction.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
<p>Edit: wow, this really blew up! Thanks for all the feedback and the awards. I should clarify a few things though. First: I'm not a therapist. I specialized in work-psychology. Second: I don't do remote diagnosis. If you have specific issues, talk to a professional in person.</p>
<p>Edit 2: I have a youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKbX8ZK5CKQBQSBAhtX__8Q" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKbX8ZK5CKQBQSBAhtX__8Q</a> where I'll have a video on stress management in Darkest Dungeon, soon. So if that sounds interesting, subscribe ðŸ˜‰</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't comment on what happens in our brains when we relax, but the only way I can &quot;force&quot; relaxation is to float in water. I haven't been able to use a pool this summer, and I've missed the relaxing effect of water enough that I bought an 8 foot livestock watering tank, and made a pool out of it. The water is deep enough to float in, and I'm able to clear my mind and just exist in weightlessness for a while.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A good pre-sleep relaxation technique is the &quot;<strong>Three breaths</strong>&quot; technique.</p>
<p>Close your eyes. Take a moderately deep breath slowly, and exhale... letting your body go slack from the top of your head down to your chest. </p>
<p>Repeat, relaxing progressively lower parts of the body. Abdomen and thighs, legs and feet.</p>
<p>It's OK to take a fourth breath if needed. </p>
<p>After that, your body should be completely relaxed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
