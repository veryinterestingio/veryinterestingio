		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s not any clear consensus at this point, but a number of things could be in play. As others have pointed out, diabetes can mess with the immune system. Another key factor seems to be that COVID messes with small blood vessels, particularly in the lungs, causing them to constrict inappropriately. This may be because the virus utilizes the receptor ACE2 in order to enter cells. ACE2 normally opposes the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which itself helps constrict blood vessels to raise blood pressure (this is the reason that ACE inhibitors are used to treat high blood pressure). So capillary beds surrounding alveoli constrict and can’t facilitate oxygen exchange. Add in the fact that the virus causes an interstitial pneumonia that messes with normal alveoli structure and function, and you have a double whammy. Oxygen exchange can’t happen even in areas where lung tissue is still intact.</p>
<p>Now, the likely reason that diabetes makes COVID worse is that diabetes can also severely damage small blood vessels. The overall pathophysiology is complex, but basically what happens is that sugars deposit in small vessel walls (i.e. glycosylation), and then the immune system interacts with them in aberrant ways that damage the vessels and ultimately prevent them from exchanging oxygen appropriately. Now this usually doesn’t manifest in respiratory problems (it more commonly affects the heart, kidneys, and peripheral nerves), but when you combine that with the havoc that COVID causes, there may be a synergistic effect.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that Type I and II diabetics may not experience COVID in the same way. If your little brother is young and has well controlled Type I diabetes, he definitely does not have the same risk as an 80-year, obese Type II diabetic who is somehow still kicking after 30 years of totally uncontrolled glucose levels. However, he probably does still have increased risk relative to a non-diabetic of the same age. That would mean he has a higher but still very small chance of having severe complications.</p>
<p>The article below is a great summary of the putative pathophysiology of COVID-19.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of it has to do with their bodies potentially being more worn down by the effects of high blood sugar over extended periods of time. If your organs are already compromised then they aren't able to hold up as well under duress. There's another school of thought though that this is more of a disease of the blood... By that I mean the virus is multiplying so much that when the cells that are harboring it burst they flood the blood. If concentrations become too high (osmolarity from virus &amp; glucose) in the blood then it becomes thick and more viscous thereby reducing flow. Reducing flow as well as increasing the amount of internal material from cell lysis sort of sets off the inflammation process and can increase the likelihood of developing blood clots. The first part was the initial theory behind the virus and the second part is the evolving theory of the virus. The problem with this virus verse other viruses in the past is that it is accumulating and the immune system isn't clearing it but rather chasing it and getting stuck (to simplify it). That's kind of why you keep hearing a lot of talk about people dying of pneumonia. The virus gets into the lungs, white blood cells chase it, get stuck and everything just accumulates. The blood clotting stuff though is equally concerning and since patient's blood is just coming back dark and tarry they are starting to think there is more to this than just pneumonia.</p>
<p>Edit: More about blood clotting w/COVID in <a href="https://news.weill.cornell.edu/news/2020/07/what-is-known-about-covid-19-and-abnormal-blood-clotting" target="_blank">Cornell Article</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>SciShow on Youtube have an excellent series on COVID19.</p>
<p>The latest episode talks about other pathways that SARS-COV-2 might be taking to get into our cells. ACE2 is well known, but there might be other ones, like e.g. CD147.</p>
<p>CD147 seems to be more prevalent amongst diabetics, which might be a reason why they are harder hit by COVID19.</p>
<p>here's the video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUnTb3_mwTY&t=0s" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUnTb3_mwTY&t=0s</a></p>
