		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's more the route of activation for the virus. During the first exposure of the Vzv(varicella-zoster virus) which is contracted through breathing or contact with the rash. The infection begins at the upper respiratory tract where it incubates for about 2 weeks before it enters the lung, travels to the blood stream and migrates to the skin to cause the rash of chicken pox. </p>
<p>In contrast for shingles, after the first bout of chicken pox, some of the virus particles settle into nerve cells (neurons) of sensory ganglia (a group of nerve cells that connect the sensory periphery and central nervous system), where they remain for many years in an inactive, hidden (latent) form.  The neurons in the sensory ganglia have nerve fibers that supply the skin and relay information to the brain about what the body is sensing—heat, cold, touch, pain. </p>
<p>When the VZV reactivates, it spreads down the long nerve fibers (axons) that extend from the sensory cell bodies to the skin. As the virus multiplies, the telltale rash erupts. With shingles, the nervous system is more deeply involved than it was during the bout with chickenpox, and the symptoms are often more complex and severe</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>chicken pox is the acute phase of initial vzv infection. shingles is reactivating a prior vzv infection that has laid dormant in the nerve root. the symptoms are different because it’s attacking the body in different ways at different phases in the “life cycle” of the virus. (airquotes cuz virus arent really alive per se)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay it’s complicated &amp; we don’t really know “why” as much as we know “how” because there aren’t any good scientific models for Varicella zoster except real humans and it’s unethical to infect and re-activate VZV in humans...but here goes a shot:</p>
<p>1) the initial route of infection, whether it starts at the skin or it starts inside a neuron makes a difference for how it spreads.</p>
<p>2) the latency period means that the virus is waiting until it has a good chance to replicate - ie when the long term memory immune cells are “weakened”. The initial infection happens when memory T and memory B cells don’t exist so the innate immune system tries to put it out but can’t do a great job due to the capabilities of the virus, and you scratch and spread it locally. So when you’re first infected by skin contact it suppresses the immune system and spreads by inducing you to create new breaks in the skin. Later in life it’s hiding inside neurons &amp; spreads down the a neuronal axon. It will jump to a new part of the body where it will infect the skin again when you scratch. Having the infection start internally means you may not know you have an active infection and you could have lesions inside your body without you realizing. There can be awful complications if it goes unchecked.</p>
<p>3) that white stuff that oozes out of shingles infections are immune cells mixed with lots of live virus. Tons. Systemic Memory of the infection pored with local suppression of the first responder immune cells, and second wave responders, slowly recruits more and more activated T and B cells to the battle. The virus erupts through the skin and scratching spreads it to another part of the body where the cycle can begin again someday in the future.</p>
<p>Lots of information about “how” here: (free) <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6151075/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6151075/</a></p>
