		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Men have a clear daily cycle of testosterone.  It peaks in the morning after waking up, and declines and fluctuates throughout the day.  Natural testosterone has a 10-100min half life, so it has a limit on how fast it can drop.</p>
<p>It also has a seasonal variation &quot;cycle&quot;:
<a href="https://bare5.com/2015/05/06/guys-and-that-time-of-year/" target="_blank">https://bare5.com/2015/05/06/guys-and-that-time-of-year/</a>  </p>
<p>Overall, the fluctuations seem to be like 2 hrs going up/2 hrs going down, but there's not a ton of data.  It's highly variable, and strongly dependent on what activity you're engaging in.  Vigorous exercise can produce a short term surge in testosterone, as well as a more long-term increase- also higher body fat % goes along with lower testosterone, so reducing body fat with exercise could account for a long term increase.</p>
<p>Treatment for &quot;low testosterone&quot; is popular right now.  The reputable doctors require the blood draw be between 7AM-10AM where testosterone levels are highest, as it commonly can fall by about a third later in the day.</p>
<p>Other places are eager to sell treatment to &quot;anybody&quot;, and may do draws at the wrong time to qualify people for it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some great answers here, I just want to add to be careful with this concept because it's a fairly common pseudo-scientific belief from the seventies. The idea is called biorythyms, and it suggests that humans have all these different hormonal rhythms on cycles that are near a month long, though it varies for each cycle, and that theu can predict our behaviour, mood, etc. It has different rhythms for our emotions, physical skills, and intellectual abilities, even for luck. It's a bunch of hooey and is no better at predicting anything than pure luck. It was, however, very popular in pop-psychology in the seventies, and it does persist around today. </p>

<p>That said, your body has all sorts of hormonal rhythms, the circadian rhythm has been mentioned, but there's also rhythms with temperature regulation, digestion, timekeeping, all sorts of things (though most are related to your circadian rhythm in some way.) That being said, none of these rhythms, that we know of, could be called a male equivalent of the female menstrual cycle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We actually all have hormonal rhythms relating mostly to the circadian clock. There is a specific region in the hypothalamus of the brain, termed the suprachiasmatic nucleus, that is thought to be in large part responsible for a variety of our daily, physiological circadian rhythms.</p>
<p>Women absolutely have hormonal rhythms unrelated to periods as do men. Although the most common usage of hormones is relating to sex hormones, there are a wide variety of hormones that govern everything from your body's stress response to water balance. If you measure the concentration of these hormones over time, you can in some cases, see distinct patterns relating to various temporal events.</p>
<p>I would like to note that usually most hormones are released in an oscillating, pulsatile manner. So even over the course of a few hours, you can see relatively wide spikes or patterns in the concentration of various hormones.</p>
<p>Here's just one source talking about circadian rhythms, but it's a very active field of research:  <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2017.00070/full" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2017.00070/full" target="_blank">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2017.00070/full</a></a></p>
<p>Edit: I would like to add the caveat that while we use the term &quot;rhythm&quot;, what we actually observe is far less orderly than what that word means. While we often will observe a general periodicity or trend in the expression or actions of a hormone, it's not usually as clean or precise as rhythm implies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physiologist here: Good question. Tough to answer thoroughly. The short answer is that the fluctuations men experience aren't very meaningful. Testosterone exerts most of it's effects on behavior (and actually most of it's targets) via transcription activation/regualtion. This takes a while to produce notable effects, and the periodic release of androgens follows largely the periodic release of LH/FSH from the pituitary. Its also important to keep in mind the perceived mood disturbance women may feel during the menses is due to the effects of hormones as well as secondary effects due to the physiologic changes (ie, what happens during the menses). It's not fair to say &quot;without the coinciding biological event&quot; becuase that event is very much involved in regulation of those cycles, and the behavior around it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
