		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a really important question. For me as a Physiotherapist, this highlights a common misconception in the industry and the wider public surrounding what something like RSI actually is and the effects of &quot;overuse&quot;. You are 100% right - we use repetition in so many ways - strengthening, endurance training, skill acquisition, learning an instrument, etc, and the body should always be expected to improve the more we do something. Use is literally what the body is designed to handle. </p>
<p>Clinically, it's not &quot;use&quot; that's inherently the issue. It's the mechanics behind the WAY we use something. <strong>Repetition is just really good at exposing poor mechanics over time.</strong></p>
<p>So if anyone feels as though they are developing RSI-type issues, the key is not to blame what you're doing but to take a step back and go looking for the relatively hidden tightness, stiffness, or weakness that is subtly compromising normal function.</p>
<p>Interestingly, for the elbows, wrists, hands, and forearms, the issue is often actually located at the base of the neck and upper back. Certain areas of the upper limbs correspond to particular parts of the spine, similar in pattern to Dermatomes. These are fetal connections that play a huge role in setting areas up for dysfunction. If you Google a dermatome chart you'll most likely be able to link where your current issue is with the spinal level that might also be tight, stiff, or dysfunctional. Similarly, the nerves that supply the affected muscles/tendons directly, originate from specific neck/upper back levels.</p>
<p>In short, RSI is far more than just overuse. It's often a consequence of some broader, more hidden dysfunction going on at the neck and upper back. Repetition should never create an issue on its own, but it may expose a hidden one if given enough time. Hope that helps!</p>
<p>I have a video that helps explain this, but not sure if its ok to link it here.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Long story short we evolved muscles. One of the ability of muscles is to grow. When they work often, they take extra resources to grow bigger/better. We have learned of the existence of this behaviors and have learned to push our muscles to force them to grow for many purposes, be they cosmetic or for actual strength. We usually push our muscles to their limit to produce growth.</p>
<p>Strain on the other hand usually refer to &quot;pushing too far&quot;. It's going past the safe limit on your muscles which can end up tearing them up a bit. Don't worry too much about it though, as long as you don't try to lift a car you shouldn't cause massive damage in a single attempt, and our body is pretty good at patching up our mistakes. Muscles doubly so. repetitive strain on the other hand mean that muscles can degrade faster than you repair them. This can lead to permanent damage that the body can no longer heal.</p>
<p>basically, don't go too far too often. Everything else should be fair game. the definition of &quot;too far&quot; is subjective as our bodies are all different and it can change over time with physical fitness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
