		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, most images are in a compressed format. If a photo has a huge amount of pixels of the same color in a given area, the file format can record this as one piece of information. It's like when you're remembering a phone number: it's a lot easier to remember a sequence if you have two or three numbers that are the same in a row. So, a picture of a blue sky is going to be smaller than a picture of a Jackson Pollock painting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Compression, imagine you have 10 pieces of paper, and they're all red, you could describe them as</p>
<p>I have 1 red paper<br />
I have 1 red paper<br />
I have 1 red paper<br />
I have 1 red paper<br />
I have 1 red paper<br />
I have 1 red paper<br />
I have 1 red paper<br />
I have 1 red paper<br />
I have 1 red paper<br />
I have 1 red paper</p>
<p>Or you could just say &quot;I have 10 red papers&quot;, you'd convey the same message, but the message itself wouldn't be as big, however if all your papers have different colors then you'll actually have to describe each one of them individually and there's no way for you to compress that, swap papers with &quot;pixels&quot; and factor in position and that's pretty much how compression works</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cameras use image compression algorithms to keep the files small, and the less information a picture contains, the better these compression algorithms work.</p>
<p>If some of the picture is black for example, the algorithm can just say 'the upper half is all black' instead of saving the color of each pixel in that area. And if it only contains a limited number of colors, that also helps.</p>
<p>If you want to try it out, take a picture in a perfectly dark room or cover the lens with something that blocks all light, and you will see that the file that comes out is much smaller than a normal photo.</p>
<p>Blurry images also tend to contain less information and are easier to compress, so if you take multiple photos of the same object, the ones with the smallest file size also tend to be the worst ones in terms of quality/sharpness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two types of file that come from a camera, the raw file, and a processed file. </p>
<p>You're right in that the raw file will always be the same size because each pixel has information.</p>
<p>The processed file (commonly .jpg or similar) has been processed by the camera or phone to be <em>much</em> smaller. Say you took a picture with some sky in it that is a huge swathe of blue. Your phone notices that and takes some shortcuts to the information it saves, rather than saving information for each pixel.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you were to use no compression, then sure, every picture would be the same size. For every pixel, you would need 3 bytes of information (or more with more colour depth). Your 2.5MB file wouldn't even be a full megapixel.</p>
<p>Instead, we use compression algorithms to reduce the amount of data we need to actually hold. We can do things like only store the difference between one pixel and the pixel next to it, since those tend to be very similar values. </p>
<p>The algorithms for good compression can get very complicated very quickly. There are also two forms of compression -- lossy and lossless. With lossless compression, you can get the raw file back in its exact format. With lossy compression, you get something that isn't pixel perfect compared to the original, but (ideally) a human eye can't tell the difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
