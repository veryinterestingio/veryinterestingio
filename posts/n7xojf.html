		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The aluminum cans have a polymer lining that can absorb some of the soda’s flavors, potentially making the taste milder. If you are slugging your soda from a plastic bottle, the soda’s flavor may be altered by some of the acetaldehyde in the plastic transferring into the drink.</p>
<p>Since glass bottles are basically inert, they’ll deliver a product very close to the original intent. The metal taste some people note from soda in cans may have more to do with their sensitivity to metal—they’re tasting the can as they put it to their lips, not a metallic taste that’s actually present in the cola. </p>
<p>Edit: since this has taken off I want to make sure the source is given credit, I shamelessly copied from <a href="https://www.rd.com/article/canned-and-bottled-soda-taste-different/" target="_blank">this Reader's Digest article</a></p>
<p>Also if anyone wants to learn more, <a href="https://youtu.be/BqLH-nTZEOc" target="_blank">Nilered made a video</a> where he isolated the chemical responsible for the &quot;old penny smell&quot;, which is a deep dive into how we perceive metal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>i work as a quality analyst in a worldwide beverage company so i think i could give  you some insights on why the beverage tastes different in different packagings. to some of you who think it's placebo, it's actually not. the flavor is basically affected by the amount of CO2 present. One of our quality release criteria is the  gas volume- the amount of CO2 present in the bev and we set a certain range, rejecting those products that fails or exceeds the set limit. </p>
<p>Glass and aluminum cans have lower porosity. This makes the 2 as good packaging materials since it helps  retain gas volumes in soda. in other words, glass and metal prevents the CO2 from &quot;escaping&quot;,  maintaining the fresh biting taste. On the other hand, plastic/PET bottles have higher porosity than the 2, which means CO2 can easily escape making the soda  bland. To compensate this difference, we deliberately increase gas volumes in PET products. fresh bottled PET sodas have very strong &quot; bite&quot; due to high volumes of CO2. </p>
<p>Also, you can confirm this by their expiry. If you notice, glass and metal packed beverage have longer expiry dates that PET ones. In bev industry, expiry is not determined by flavor going bad but by CO2 retention. Since glass or metal can retain gas better they can last up to1 yr whereas PET only can last 3 to 6 mos. </p>
<p>Other factors affecting taste are trace iron in crowns/caps, trace acetaldehyde in PET and oxidation (prolonged direct sunlight exposure).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve learned (from a local brewery) that cans are the best way to package drinks because they allow no light to effect the product. </p>
<p>And the metallic taste comes from the smell of the can - if the liquids were poured into a glass to drink they would taste the same ( or the can would possibly taste better if the plastic/glass bottle was exposed to too much light)</p>
<p>Think about it like a tiny keg of beer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
