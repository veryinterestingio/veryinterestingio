		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>hey /uSnowFoxes34, particles like electrons have charges, and moving charges form a magnetic field, but it was found that even at rest electron's were found to have a magnetic field, which would mean that the electrons are spinning balls of charges that is how they produce a magnetic field (according to classical physics), Then came quantum physics and showed that these particles are not spinning balls, they have an intrinsic magnetic field which is not because of any motion. although it was proven that these particles don't spin like this, the name stuck and the property is called spin, and the values is based on the charges and the amount of magnetic field created </p>
<p>Hope this helped</p>
<p>Edit: Another reason that the name wasn't changed because the magnetic field due to the intrinsic spin was very similar to that created by an actual spinning ball</p>
<p>Edit 2: I saw a lot of confusion in the comments so I am making this edit</p>
<p>This answer was not supposed to be a solid definition of spin, it was just an easy to understand way.</p>
<p>Particles do not need to have charge/produce magnetic field to have spin, It is related to angular momentum.</p>
<p>Angular momentum when combined with charge gives a magnetic field</p>
<p>I chose to use the magnetic field of an electron becuz it is an observable effect which I thought would make it easier to understand</p>
<p>even neutral particles can have a spin</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Spin&quot; is an intrinsic form of angular momentum carried by elementary particles. The existence of spin angular momentum is inferred from experiments.</p>
<p>Notably, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern%E2%80%93Gerlach_experiment" target="_blank">Stern–Gerlach experiment</a>, conducted around 1920-21, showed that silver atoms were observed to possess two possible discrete angular momenta despite having no orbital angular momentum.</p>
<p>In the original experiment, silver atoms were sent through a spatially varying magnetic field, which deflected them before they struck a detector screen. Particles with non-zero magnetic moment are deflected from straight path due to the magnetic field gradient. The screen reveals two discrete points of accumulation, rather than a continuous distribution. This result can only be explained by the atoms having quantized spin. This experiment was decisive in convincing physicists of the reality of angular-momentum quantization in all atomic-scale systems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a quantum property of tiny particles that appears to have similar properties as classical angular momentum. The particle isn't actually spinning, however, because it can't (it doesnt have any size). </p>
<p>&quot;Spin is intrinsic angular momentum associated with elementary particles.  It is a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon without any analog in classical physics.  Spin is not associated with any rotating internal parts of elementary particles; it is intrinsic to the particle itself.&quot; (<a href="http://electron6.phys.utk.edu/phys250/modules/module%203/spin.htm" target="_blank">http://electron6.phys.utk.edu/phys250/modules/module%203/spin.htm</a>)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Suppose they ask you &quot;are you a foodie&quot;, and you ask back <em>what do you mean by 'foodie'?</em> You can think of 'foodie' as some mysterious property of your ideal self, like there's this abstract thing called 'your personality' which includes 'is a foodie' as a description. But then you could ask <em>well but... what IS that property, can I touch it or see it?</em> And there this 'abstract' point of view kinda fails: you <em>cant</em> see directly your foodie-ness, you can only see <em>consequences</em> of that foodie-ness (e.g. you eat fancy cheeses and down them with fancy wine).</p>
<p>There's a different, more hands-on point of view though: your foodie-ness just describes <em>how you interact with food.</em> It describes the fact that you prefer fancy cheeses and wines than a BigMac, or that you rather cook a risotto than fries. It's a down-to-earth description of your preferences, as opposed to being an abstract description of your personality.</p>
<p>Same goes for spin. If you think of spin as an abstract part of a particle, then you won't really directly <em>see spin itself</em> as you would see a color, or hear a sound. But that's irrelevant physically. Spin just tells you how a particle interacts with magnetic fields and other particles.</p>
<p>For example, if a particle is charged and has non-zero spin, then it produces a magnetic field even when it's sitting still. (As opposed to the case where it was charged but had zero spin, in which case it would only produce a magnetic field when it's moving.)</p>
<p>The higher the spin is, the stronger it interacts with magnetic fields. The spin is a number in some set of allowed values (either integer of half-integer). If you really like quantum field-theory, you'll be delighted by the proof of why those are the allowed values. But that isn't necessary when describing what spin is: each one of those values is just a possible way to interact with magnetic fields/other particles.</p>
<p>A cool thing is that, while it is a single number, it summarizes some complicated physics in a cool way. For example if you put together a shitload of particles with spin = an integer, and put them in a very powerful freezer, the physics you'll see is extremely different than if the particles would've had spin = 1/2. </p>
<p>So my take on it is tldr: there is no esoteric mysterious 'spin', it's just a number we use to describe the physics of the particle. Nevermind the confusing choice of word 'spin', it's nothing to do with anything spinning. It has a lot to do, however, with how the particle creates magnetic fields (and reacts to them).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The standard answer is just to accept that it's a fundamental fact of particles in quantum mechanics. But interestingly, the notion of &quot;spin&quot; and a spinor exists in math and classical field theory as well. </p>
<p>The mathematics of the topic are quite complex and a thorough understanding is quite difficult, so I'll just do a bunch of hand waving.</p>
<p>But an interesting analogy can be made to imaginary numbers. If I have a negative number such as <code>-4</code> and attempt to take the square root I have to introduce an object that has the definition <code>i = sqrt(-1)</code>. This is pretty simple and you learn this in middle/high school.</p>
<p>In geometry, you have the notion of vectors. A simple vector can be the position of an object in a 3 dimension coordinate system : <code>v = (1, 1, 1)</code> for vector pointing at a point displaced one meter upwards, one meter forwards and one meter to the right from the origin. If we wanted to define an object <code>q</code> such that <code>q = sqrt(v)</code> (in a <em>very</em> rough sense) then you're free to do so. It turns out that objects like this do exist and have very important mathematical value. We call these objects &quot;spinors.&quot;</p>
<p>We require a bit more background knowledge to get to the point -- quantum field theory uses fields (objects with a value at every point of spacetime). The simplest fields are scalar fields which correspond to particles what we call scalar bosons (for example, the Higgs boson). A scalar field has a single value at every point in spacetime. (This is analogous to the temperature at every point in the room you are currently in.) We take these scalar fields (e.g. the Higgs field) and quantize it via the mechanisms of quantum field theory and find our particle based phenomenons.</p>
<p>For a particle such as an electron (and positron) we use spinor fields. The electron field exists at every point in spacetime and takes on a spinorial value: e.g. a field who can be combined with itself to generate a vector. This spinor field <code>q(x)</code> can be multiplied by it's adjoint (analogous to it's complex conjugate) <code>q'(x)</code> and some &quot;correctional value&quot; <code>γ</code> to generate a vector <code>q'(x)γq(x) = v(x)</code> at every point in space time. This vector representation interacts with the electromagnetic field <code>A(x)</code> and we get electromagnetism. </p>
<p>Ultimately, I didn't explain to you what spin is or why particles have it, but I always found this &quot;square root&quot; like relationship very interesting.</p>
<p>The real understand of &quot;why do particles have spin&quot; comes from ideas that are much more complex. If you have scalar fields (e.g. single value at every point in spacetime), vector fields (a vector value at every point in spacetime) and tensor fields (a &quot;matrix&quot; of values at every point in space time) then the natural choice is to also accept spinor fields. Up to the point that you start studying what's called &quot;representation theory&quot; for Lie groups you just always included vectors and scalars because, well, they obviously exist. But there was no fundamental rational for their inclusion. But representation theory teaches how to enumerate the possible types of fields we can see in our theories. And we see that spinors should exist in the same sense that scalars or vectors should exist. And &quot;why do particles have spin&quot; is &quot;because nature likes to be mathematically rigorous and we have to accept all irreducible representations of the Lorentz group and some representations are spinorial.&quot; At this point your question becomes &quot;why does nature exhibit Lorentzian symmetry&quot; and we point you to philosophy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
