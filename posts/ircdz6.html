		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sidestepping the air pressure question of a hypothetical hole, we can estimate the gravitational acceleration as a function of depth, taking into account material below and above a given point exerting an attraction (i.e. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_theorem" target="_blank">shell theorem</a>) but also that the density of the Earth changes as a function of depth (using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preliminary_reference_Earth_model" target="_blank">PREM</a>), and thus the mass of the Earth is not uniformly distributed. If you did these calculations you would <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preliminary_reference_Earth_model#/media/File:EarthGravityPREM.jpg" target="_blank">see, as illustrated in this figure,</a> that gravitational acceleration reaches a maximum at the core-mantle boundary and then decreases to 0 at the center of the core (there are also curves on there assuming a constant density or a linearly increasing density within the Earth for comparison). This is all highly idealized assuming a spherical Earth and concentric spherical layers with constant density within that layer (which are most definitely not the case), but would get you closer to the 'true answer' than assuming a constant density.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few fun facts about (Newtonian) gravity:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you replace a solid sphere with a point-like object with the same mass, the gravitational field of the sphere and the point-like object would be the same for distances greater than the radius of that sphere. So, if you replaced the Earth by an equally massive tennis ball, you would experience the same attraction at a distance of 6731km (3959 miles, which is the earth’s radius) to that tennis ball (ignoring that the Earth is not a perfect sphere). Of course, that would be no ground pushing you up, so you would start accelerating towards the massive tennis ball. However, the International Space Station could orbit tennis-ball Earth in exactly the same way it is orbiting regular Earth.</li>
<li>If you replace a solid sphere with a hollow sphere with the same radius and mass, the gravitational field outside of both spheres would be the same.</li>
<li>If you are inside a hollow sphere, there would be a gravitational pull towards all directions. Obviously, there is no gravitational pull at the center of the hollow sphere, the gravitational pull from all directions is canceling out, so you would experience weightlessness. Funnily, the same is the case not only for the center, but for <em>every</em> point inside the sphere. So, you would experience weightlessness at every point inside a massive hollow sphere.</li>
<li>Now, to answer your question: You can think about Earth like a Matrjoschka-like collection of nested hollow spheres. If you are moving down a hole, you would be inside some of those hollow spheres, but not inside the others. The gravitational pull from the hollow spheres that encompass you would cancel each other out, and only the hollow spheres below you would result in actual gravitational pull. So, if you dig a hole down 75% through the mantle, the gravitational pull at the bottom of that hole would be the same as if you stripped away the outer 75% of Earth (in terms of its radius). This does not mean that the gravitational pull only decreases as you move down that hole, though, because Earth is not a homogeneous sphere (see answer from /u/CrustalTrudger)</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There would be less mass between you and the center of the Earth, but there would be <em>more</em> mass between you and the surface of the Earth. At the center of a spherical Earth of uniform density, you would accelerate equally in every direction. Unless I am mistaken, you would experience this as weightlessness.  </p>
<p>You weigh less in a Zeppelin than you do at sea level because the Zeppelin carries you farther away from the Earth and closer to the stars. At Zeppelin distances, the Earth’s mass overwhelms the stars’ mass for calculating purposes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
