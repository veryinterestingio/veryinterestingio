		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gravity and magnetism are very different forces. (This is an ELI5 so this is a very simplified explanation). </p>
<p>The force of gravity is proportional to the mass of both objects. In the case of the earth, a high mass object &quot;feels&quot; a higher force and a low mass object &quot;feels&quot; a lower force. The result is that the acceleration is identical since the effects of mass difference essentially &quot;cancel out&quot;. (Since acceleration is proportional to the force). </p>
<p>The force of magnetism is NOT governed by an object's mass. A high mass object might feel the same magnetic force as a small mass object (operating in the same magnetic field). So this results in greater acceleration for the smaller mass than the high mass object.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the gravitational force is explicitly proportional to the mass of both objects attracting each other. A large object made of the same material has more mass, so is attracted more strongly, but because of its greater mass, that cancels out and the acceleration works out the same. In the case of a magnet the attractive force is dependent entirely on the strength of its magnetic field, which is intrinsic to the magnet and isn't affected by the mass of the other object, so it will exert the same force, meaning lighter objects will accelerate faster.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mass, and how it fits.</p>
<p>1) Gravity is proportional to mass. Double the ball's mass, get double the pull.</p>
<p>2) Magnetism isn't proportional to mass. Double the ball's mass, get the same pull.</p>
<p>3) In both cases, there's also inertia trying to keep things the same. Inertia is proportional to mass. Double the ball's mass, get twice the reluctance to accelerate.</p>
<p>So. See what happens when you double the mass.</p>
<p>a) Gravity. Double the pull; double the inertia. The two cancel out. A heavier ball accelerates in just the same way as a lighter one.</p>
<p>b) Magnetism. Same pull; double the inertia. Inertia wins. A heavier ball accelerates more slowly than a lighter one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Magnets accelerate objects at a speed proportional to &quot;magnetic force / mass&quot;, so a heavy magnetic object like a giant neodymium magnet will move fast, but a light and non-magnetic object like a feather won't move at all.</p>
<p>Gravity accelerates objects based on mass so it's proportional to mass / mass, or more simply put, mass is irrelevant, everything is the same</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lighter objects do indeed move faster when tugged, but with gravity, the heavier object is also tugged more. In fact, gravity's tug is exactly enough to offset the fact that you have to tug a heavy object more to get it going as fast as a lighter object.</p>
<p>Magnetism's tug isn't based on mass. You still need to tug harder to move a heavier object, but magnetisim doesn't tug heavier objects more. The result is that lighter objects move faster.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
