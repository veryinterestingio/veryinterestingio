		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Serious inbreeding can be avoided with 200 animals.  That's enough to introduce enough genetic mixup without causing too much of a problem (if there were only 2 rhinos, and the whole population had to stem from that, you'd have potential problems).</p>
<p>There is something called the 50/500 rule made in 1980 by Australian geneticist Ian Franklin and American biologist Michael Soule.  This rule suggests a minimum population of 50 in order to combat inbreeding, though a minimum of 500 to reduce genetic drift.</p>
<p>This is a bit of a generalization, and does vary species to species (species who have higher &quot;litters&quot; like mice and insects can tolerate lower populations than species with lower numbers (like large mammals or huge trees).  So in the case of a rhino, 200 is probably enough to introduce enough genetic variability to avoid major inbreeding problems, but there may be some genetic drift, and if the population were to balloon back to normal wild levels, those Rhinos may be significantly genetically different from the wild Rhinos of old as a result of so many offspring coming from a small source gene pool.</p>
<p>EDIT: Wow, thanks for the silvers, responses, and support!  I'm happy to have helped, in some small way, make the internet slightly more useful than a big porn box.</p>
<p>EDIT2: Now GOLD?!  You flatter me, Reddit!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A very rigorous and extensive planned breeding program. Like others said, as long as they aren't too genetically similar to start with, 200 is easily a big enough genetic pool to produce offspring without inbreeding effects. You just have to ensure, through relocation or captive breeding, that the various populations intermingle and continue diversifying. So you start by cataloging the existing animals and their genealogies as far as you can. Then you closely monitor the existing animals and ensure different lines are interbreeding. If a population becomes too isolated and begins trying to inbreed, then you move some viable adults from a different population into the stagnating one. It's a lot of work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading about how all giant squids, regardless of which ocean you find them in, have incredibly similar DNA.  This could be a result of giant squids becoming nearly extinct at some point in time, and then later their population is restored, but it came from a limited gene pool, that is, the few survivors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If i remember the paper correctly, you can re-breed from as few as \~30, though at that point it requires VERY carefully management and there will be some....unfortunate ones. Anything in the 3 figures is pretty manageable assuming the animals will breed in at least relative captivity, which isn't guaranteed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
