	<title>ELI5: In the recent days in Atlanta, Trixie the whale shark dies at the Georgia Aquarium. With whale sharks being the largest fish species in the world, what do they do with the body once a fish this size passes away? It must to be a lot different that what we do with human bodies after death.</title>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Speaking from experience with large animals in managed care, I can tell you that these institutions either have a way to cremate animals or work closely with a pathology facility that does. </p>
<p>After an animal’s death, a thorough post-mortem examination is performed and many samples are collected. Then the carcass is incinerated. If this is done off grounds, the transport is usually “hush hush” before the death is officially announced.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They would probably be doing a necropsy to figure out the cause of death. Tissue samples and DNA samples collected and stored for future research.</p>
<p>Sometimes the rest of the remains will be donated for educational purposes like to museums. Or if it's deemed free of parasites or diseases, it might be returned to the ocean and serve as something akin to a &quot;whale fall&quot; site.</p>
<p>Or they would just cremate the remains once they've gathered all the data they need.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can’t say from experience about large captive animals, but I assisted with necropsy and carcass preservation of a blue whale in Atlantic Canada. </p>
<p>After samples from as many tissues as possible were taken, the whale was essentially cut up with large knives. It was dragged further ashore using heavy machinery and veterinarians and pathologists handed it over to technicians and students. It was at a point where most connective tissues were broken down so bones weren’t a concern, and our goal was to preserve and display the skeleton eventually. The flesh was trucked away to be incinerated and the raw bones were trucked to an agricultural college to be composted under a big compost heap. They unearthed an almost completely clean and intact skeleton a few months later. </p>
<p>Now it is being handled by a university curator and an arts and design college to 3-D print any missing bones and articulate everything together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
