		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A kid I babysit can solve 10+4 but not 4+10. I know kids memorize things really well, so it made me wonder if she's actually just memorized all of the sums she knows. Lo and behold, she can't solve the reverse order of any math problems her teacher taught her. </p>
<p>When can the brain really start to solve basic math problems using logic and not memorization? And to extend on that - how do we accurately find this out if the kids might have just memorized the answers? And to dump a third, and kind of hypothetical question onto the pile - why bother teaching and testing math skills before their brains are actually able to do math?</p>
<p>Edit: thank you for the incredibly helpful answers! I just wanted to assure you I'm in no way trying to change her approach to doing math, or anything like that. I've been in varying levels of childcare for more than ten years and this developmental stage has always been fascinating to me :) I feel like I can actually use some of the information here to more effectively do my job, so thank you!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Piaget goes into this if you read up on his theory, which does have some problems now that we know more about development. Specifically I think it was called inversions or something, where at a certain point the brain develops enough to know that A = B is the same as B = A, which would help a child solve the same problem you used. This occurs during grade school which is usually when children start learning stuff like the Transitive Property and etc.  </p>
<p>It's called the concrete operations stage (ages 7 to 11) because it's when children first learn to use logic and reasoning to solve problems (operations) but can generally only do so when presented with concrete examples (such as word problems in math class). Next is formal operations IIRC which is middle/high school where they can now abstractly apply logical operations to problems they face in life which is why math becomes much more advanced during these years of schooling.  </p>
<p>The major criticism of Piaget is that he underestimated children's abilities because he just test as-is and made assumptions based off that, but in studies to replicate his findings a lot of the time children could be taught to use logic to solve the problems he was presenting the children if it was presented in the right way, which might mean instead of a specific age being required it's more about experience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I just spent 4 months writing a paper on math difficulties interventions and how we learn math. </p>
<p>You've made a few incorrect assumptions in your understanding of the issue. </p>
<p>Learning math requires exposure to numeracy and association of symbolic number and quantity.  The IPS is a brain area associated with activation of selective neurons for specific numerical values (though math is not localized and uses the fronto-parietal network). While there are many theories for how we learn math the triple code model relies on exposure and number line tasks to build relations between symbol 4 / word four / quantity 4 dots. </p>
<p>In western culture (because it would seem learning by abacus does different things) children need to be able to establish a mental number line (we initially start with a logarithmic line (distance apart changes based on values)) the establishment of a linear line allows for the distinction between selective numerosities (many interventions focus on correcting and establishing a number line). </p>
<p>Next off almost all math you do is memorization in novel math users (1st/2nd graders) brain activation is significantly different than in experienced users (4th/5th graders) who heavily use brain regions associated with memory. Even when approaching novel math tasks you do so by analyzing known and unknown parts comparing them to similar knowns and approaching by strategies garnered from memory. That's what learning is using your acquired knowledge to approach tasks.</p>
<p>The question is how do we know if someone has just memorized answers can be hard especially since memorization is key for learning (students that struggle to conceptualize and have issues with white matter connectivity - preventing ease of access tend to have math learning difficulties). Presenting new problems such as expanding the number set from 1-10 to 1-100 (addition/subtraction tasks) can show if the students can carry over concepts instead of just saying (4+4=8) manipulations of equations (which does require higher understanding is a useful metric for students later on in primary school to assess mld).</p>
<p>Math learning research in general </p>
<p>The big take away though is we also dont know a lot about learning and math. Both neuroscience (functional imaging studies) cognitive neuro/psych studies really say we know these regions light up but there is not much association between what that means and where stuff goes wrong. Math learning is insanely understudied hope on psychinfo/web of science/google scholar whatever your choice and go compare how many hits you get relative to literacy and learning (it's out number 100s/1000s : 1). </p>
<p>We need more people researching how we learn math, metrics for better testing if we conceptualize understanding and better math interventions for those who fail to. </p>
<p>I can grab some sources we used in our paper we presented to the Learnng disabilities association in London if you would like to explore the topic further.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what you mean by &quot;math&quot;. Hens can do simple arithmetics. The kind of abstract mathematics humans are capable of is probably only viable in humans, and the really interesting discoveries are typically done in quite a narrow age range.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
