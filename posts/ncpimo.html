		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The housing market is crazy. There are not enough houses to meet demand, and people are raising prices accordingly. I just read an article that a Kia dealership is raising the prices of its Teluride to $80,000, because demand is so high. How is that not price gouging? And why aren’t people getting fined for it?  </p>
<p>I ask, because I see other businesses getting fined and reported for raising prices of items when demand is high, like gas and toilet paper. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t think it’s right, but where is the line?  Who determines who gets fined and what is actually being price gouged?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Price gouging&quot; by definition happens only in a crisis, like a natural disaster. It's taking advantage of a <em>sudden</em> shortage in a <em>critical</em> good. Like if your city's water system blows up, and suddenly somebody starts selling bottled water for $300 a bottle. That's price gouging.</p>
<p>Any other changes in price, in any situation that isn't a crisis, or in any good that's not strictly critical, is not price gouging. It's other changes in price resulting from other changes in supply and demand.</p>
<p>That's not to say that rising prices are never a problem, as long as they aren't price gouging. They could very well be a problem! They could be a result of rampant inflation like in the 1970s, or of a financial bubble like real estate in 2008, or of a company attaining monopoly power in its industry. Those are all very bad market conditions. But they're not &quot;price gouging&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Price Gouging is not the act of raising your price as demand goes up. Price Gouging is the act of drastically raising your price on an essential good or service during a period of emergency when there is little or no competition and/or no time for people to find competition that has price you prefer. </p>
<p>The specifics of what is and is not price gouging is set in law in most States/Countries. Not all agree, but they do typically roughly fit the definition I gave you above. The specific scenario you ask about is not price gouging because it is not a sudden increase in pricing, by an extremely large amount over a short amount of time, it is not on a good or service that is of essential need, and it is not during a time of emergency.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The price of cars and housing is typically a long term supply and demand trend, heavily influenced by the price of money, with a lot of slow moving long term factors influencing the prices.</p>
<p>The recent gas shortage in parts of the US - this is a specific event driven shortage that everyone knows is going to be in place for a very short time, but affects a commodity that a lot of people have an acute need for. Gouging prices for a necessity that is going to be going back to normal prices in a few days is regulated, in no small part to reduce the risk of civil unrest that might develop in response to a very temporary set of circumstances.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Uninformed answer but I believe it has to do with the size/velocity of the market. Houses are sold far less frequently than TP or petrol and the supply is far less elastic - there are only so many houses available. If a person wants to sell their house then they can set whatever price they want as long as someone is willing to buy.
Gas and TP are markets with much quicker turnover than houses. A gas station owner seeing a short term shortage could triple/quadruple prices while people are on line at the pump which is quite unsavory behavior. I think the TP stuff at the start of the pandemic was quite different from either of the other scenarios</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
