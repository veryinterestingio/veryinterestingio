</blockquote>
<p>Just want to be clear that this is absolutely untrue. The German health minister again confirmed today that the standards were not lowered in any way, it's just that the approval board is being sent the data as the study progresses instead of in bulk at the end of the study to speed up the approval. This might make it seem like the requirements are less, even though they aren't.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/JeCbW05fxbU" target="_blank">Link</a> to the press conference. Relevant part at and around 15:44. In German.</p>
<p>This is dangerous misinformation that could hurt people's willingness to take the vaccine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
