<p>Also most sports bars have a switching system setup so they can adjust which audio is going to be live, the better ones adjust to the more pressing games for the clientele at the time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who has spent a lot of time watching sports both live and in sports bars, it comes down to a combination of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Closed captions tend to run 4-10 seconds behind the actual announcing, making them much less helpful for anybody relying on them to keep track of the play. The captions are also often full of errors, and do block out a significant portion of the screen at larger sizes.</li>
<li>Most sports bar employees are not going to immediately know how to turn the closed captions on and off on each TV in the bar (of which there are usually many different brands and models, none of which use the exact same controls).</li>
<li>Sports referees already use many clear and distinct hand signals for calls, from strikes and outs in baseball to penalties in football and hockey. </li>
<li>And finally, most sporting events can be fully enjoyed without announcers. It's akin to watching a game in person live, and it's the preferred way for a lot of people to take in the action. For on-field announcements, modern television graphics handle most all of the information not immediately obvious to someone watching.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a person who has actually worked at a ton of sports bars the answer is way simpler than most explanations here. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>it usually hides the ticker at the bottom of the screen with all the stats and news from other games.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most people hate it. for every dude asking to turn subtitles on there's four or five other dudes complaining as soon as you do. </p>
</li>
<li>there's usually only a couple people working that know how to use the remotes competently enough to turn it on. Last place I work still had the remotes from 1999. I came in one day and a co-worker had the Comcast app open on her phone and she was pointing it at the cable box with no idea why it wouldn't work.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the UK at least I've seen captions on sports games in bars. But not always, and it could be because those shows are live and captions aren't always fast enough and with high enough quality to be coherent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
