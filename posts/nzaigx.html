		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the fetus grows, it turns on programs of genes, including triggers to stop. These programs can in turn trigger other programs until all the necessary programs have been executed. Some of these programs are kept open into our infancy, adolescence or even adulthood. This system of genetic control is fairly well characterized in Drosophila flys, c. Elegans flatworms and plants like arabidopsis, but much less understood in humans. What we do know is that the group of genes known as homeobox (Hox) play a critical role in triggering gene programs related to body architecture and therefore also height.</p>
<p>Interestingly, twin studies show a heritability of body size in the order of 60-70%, but attempts at pinpointing this to specific genes (in genome-wide association studies, GWAS) have largely failed. It is just, very, very complex.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are hormone clocks wired into our DNA; a hormone activates this part of growing while also activating a second hormone that slowly stops the last from working and starts the next part which activates a third etc. This allows puberty and maturation processes to happen sequentially</p>
<p>Nutrition also has a massive role to play; good nutrition while young allows those stages to occur optimally, which means faster in this case. As the stages are timed; better nutrition means bigger people. Average height of the world drastically increased after the industrial revolution as better nutrition was more widespread. Also why heigh is looked upon favourably still as you used to have to be rich to grow tall kids reliably.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your dna basically. Like there’s more too it but basically your dna is blueprints for the building that is you and just like with an actual building it’s meant to be a certain size no more no less. Now mind you sometimes weird things can happen and you can grow to be gigantic or just be stunted to a less than average size but that’s definitely not normal or common.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body's growth is influenced by several hormones throughout the years. These hormones affect your long bones' growth plate, which makes the bones grow in length.</p>
<p>From birth, thyroid hormone is involved with your bone growth. From around 9 months old, Insulin-Like Growth Factor (IGF) and Growth Hormone (GH) are involved. Just before puberty, glucocorticoids from your adrenals start playing a role. And finally, in puberty, sex hormones (estrogens and androgens such as testosterone) start playing a role. These sex hormones finally close the growth plates as well, which means they won't grow any further.</p>
<p>During the whole window of growth, nutrition naturally plays a vital part as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are various factors involved :
DNA (genetics code)
Hormones (triggering/inhibiting)</p>
<p>These all work in harmony to control/modify the body growth.</p>
<p>Think of a domino effect, once chain reaction starts it goes on till all dominos don't go down. Similarly once the fertilization occur, body starts growing untill  the triggering harmone doesn't stop getting secreted.</p>
<p>(PS once you induce an unwanted factor in chain reaction, the whole system collapse in same way once something goes wrong(diet/genetic code/accident etc) the body growth gets derailed.)</p>
<p>*There are certain genetic code in DNA which makes the body symmetrical, hormones which keep the chemical coordination intact for growth)</p>
