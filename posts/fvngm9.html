Here's a study where healthy people were tested for viruses:  &quot;Among 92% of participants, at least one virus was detected, with some participants harboring around 10-15 viruses. On average, each participant harbored five viruses. The researchers say they were surprised to find so many. “We only sampled up to five body sites in each person and would expect to see many more viruses if we had sampled the entire body,” <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/282751#Seven-families-of-viruses-identified,-including-HPV-and-herpesvirus" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/282751#Seven-families-of-viruses-identified,-including-HPV-and-herpesvirus" target="_blank">https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/282751#Seven-families-of-viruses-identified,-including-HPV-and-herpesvirus</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sure, if they aren't causing negative symptoms, we might not have detected them.  There are even viruses that are good for you, like phages that live in the digestive tract and go after bacteria. Phages have been used to treat ailments such as dysentery and sepsis.</p>
<p>There have also been very well known harmful viruses that have high asymptomatic numbers.  Polio, for example, has been estimated to be between 70 and 90% asymptomatic - <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/polio.html" target="_blank">The CDC says 72%</a></p>
<p>If there are viruses that have 90+% asymptomatic rates, there is no reason to believe that there couldn't be viruses that were 99% asymptomatic and the 1% who had symptoms were never correctly diagnosed, especially in the past when diagnostic equipment was not as advanced</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes.</p>
<p>When people think of diseases, they usually think of horrible outcomes for the host.  But the most successful disease doesn't harm the host.  In fact, even more success would confer some evolutionary advantage to the host - the better to spread the virus around.</p>
<p>When the host dies, the disease loses too.  Illness is failure for the disease.  And for a virus - whose dual purpose seems to be to replicate and to embed itself in the hosts genetic code - death is a spectacular failure.</p>
<p>If you look at the Hanta virus, it inhabits the field mouse.  The field mouse lives nearly everywhere from the burning hot fields of the African savanna, to the permafrost of Siberia to nearly the whole of the Americas.  Therefore, the hanta virus, too, lives in nearly all environments.  In its lifetime, a field mouse may shed billions of the virus, with no discernible deleterious effect to the mouse.  Nearly every mouse has the virus, yet no mouse is harmed by it.  Curiously, there are millions of different strains of the Hanta virus, but only a handful of those strains are harmful to humans.  If you were to travel but 20 miles in any direction, it is likely that you would pass from an area of one strain to another.</p>
<p>In this case, the vast majority of the Hanta virus fails to thrive in human hosts at all.  Those few strains that can harm us also fail spectacularly - having only very limited success.  Just enough that they end up sickening the host and possibly killing us.  Again, for a virus, perfect success is to both replicate itself indefinitely, or to embed itself in the hosts genetic code without harming the host - and maybe even helping the host spread it around.</p>
<p>Our gut bacteria almost certainly started out as invaders at some point in our distant past.  But over time, our biology adjusted to them even as they evolved to flourish in us.  And now we host as series of flora and fauna in our guts that help break down food; we would die of malnutrition if not for them.  But it's quite certain we did not start out that way.  At some point, many of our far distant ancestors most assuredly died in droves with the introduction of each &quot;stomach bug&quot; that invaded our digestive tract.  Only those capable of tolerating each bacterium survived to later evolved into us.</p>
<p>Viruses have no intelligence, of course.  They have no conscious purpose, no intent.  They just are.  What they do, they do without thought or motive or malice.  There is no intent to sicken or kill.  And you can't even say they want to replicate, or embed themselves.  All that they do is pure chemical reaction; nothing more.  But the complexity and targeted chemistry can lead (and has led) more than one researcher to anthropomorphize them; to believe they are guided by some intelligence.</p>
<p>Up to 9% of the human genome is made up of virus DNA embedded in our own like the wrecks of ancient ships that once sailed within our cells.  This points to a part of human history - our past battles with pandemics going back not just thousands, but hundreds of millions of years.  Back to ancestors before they were hominids, before they were anthropoids, before they were even primates.  It's been a battle between our host cells and these invading bits of chemical flotsam for 3 billion years.  3 billion years of co-evolution.  I very much doubt we would be as we are today without the viral, bacterial, and fungal contribution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A large majority of human are infected by toxoplasmosis, I think this happened at the time when we domesticated certain feline, especially the cat which is the main host.</p>
<p>This parasite is mostly asymptomatic, but sometimes it does have some effect(I had a surgery due to this parasite that decided to make its nest in my eyes) the surgeon explained that you can’t really get rid of it, and due to what she know, she actively avoided traveling in certain country due to certain type of virus and parasite that exist in the air(!)</p>
<p>Where things get really weird is that, according to some studies this parasite may hijack the behavior of the host(rats become more risk oriented, therefore die faster so that the parasite can travel faster through different species ect..)
It is not yet sure if some parasite like this one may affect human behavior in the same way, but we do host a lot of fun parasite like that with not so clear symptom </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  I donate blood regularly and there is a virus everyone is screened for.   It’s a 48hr thing that just gets you feeling a little off but then you recover quickly.  They try to keep your blood separate from non carriers as they want to give the truely sick the best chance of recovery.<br />
Can’t remember what the name of the virus is though</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
