How did my graft get &quot;plugged back into&quot; the blood supply? How long would it have taken for the capillaries to have connected, and what is the specific mechanism by which them lil' blood pipes found each other?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several stages for a graft to &quot;take&quot;. </p>
<p>The first stage is fibrin adhesion, in which fibrin acts as a kind of glue for the graft. Fibrin is whats in blood clots and it makes a mesh to stop bleeding.</p>
<p>Then there is plasma imbibition and it means that the grafted tissue is &quot;absorbing&quot; what it needs from the underlying area, and it is something temporary that happens in the first couple days until the graft is more established.</p>
<p>After this is the phase of inosculation and revascularization, and in this phase there is the growth of new blood vessels (neoangiogenesis is a big topic, but know that tissues that are devoid of a blood supply, ischemic tissues, stimulate the production of new vessels in order to remedy the situation). These new vessels enter the graft or connect to vascular channels in the graft (the graft tissue has its own vessels that were cut off when it was taken), and this process happens from day 2 to up to around a week.</p>
<p>Finally there is the remodelling phase, which is what it sounds like. There are some processes that continue happening over a week after the graft, like continued revascularization and fibrogenesis, which means that some special cells make connective fibers and some other materials that contribute to the extracellular environment which is very important for cells' normal function. This helps the graft to properly fit in to its new environment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as I am aware, first the graft is placed and sutured in place, vessels are not normally manually connected, in the early phase of transplant the outer layers of the graft begin to necrose and the underlying tissue becomes inflamed with a fibrin mesh underneath it. This causes blood to 'pool' beneath the graft. The remaining tissue is perfused by plasma and infiltrates (white cells, blood cells etc.) from this pool. Over time the graft heals by becoming somewhat continous with the underlying tissue as the inflammation decreases, the epithelium undergoes quite a dramatic change and continues to remodel till day 28. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Menalaas has the correct framework if you want to think about this on the macrocellular scale (the way a plastic surgeon approaches this).</p>
<p>On a molecular scale, the dominant pathway is the HIF-1a (hypoxia inducible factor 1a) growth factor pathway.  Hif-1a is constantly made by the cells in your body, and immediately degraded. </p>
<p>The protein which tags it for degradation in called von hippel lindau protein (pVHL).</p>
<p>Oxygen is a necessary co-factor for pVHL to do its job. So when there is normal oxygen tension in the tissue, pVHL can make sure all the HIF-1a is immediately destroyed.</p>
<p>When there is low oxygen tension, pVHL can't do anything, so HIF-1a builds up.</p>
<p>When HIF-1a builds up, it joins up with HIF-1b where it moves to the nucleus and causes the transcription of a lot of different growth factors.</p>
<p>One of these growth factors is VEG-F (vascular endothelial growth factor), which is a potent stimulator or vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. </p>
<p>This is how the body &quot;senses&quot; low oxygen and converts that to a signal for new blood vessel growth in that tissue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
