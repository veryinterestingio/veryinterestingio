<p>The physical meaning of a positive cosmological constant is often thought to be the ground state energy of quantum fluctuations within a vacuum, but our calculations don't seem to match reality.</p>
<p>Inflation, on the other hand, is thought to have been caused by a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_field" target="_blank">scalar field</a> (the Higg's field is an example of a, and the only known fundamental, scalar field).</p>
<p>There is a competing theory for dark energy though, called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintessence_(physics)" target="_blank">Quintessence</a>, which posits that dark energy is a scalar field.</p>

<p>Inflation is still not very understood, and I dare say, less understood than dark energy. The reason sometimes people speak of them together in the same breath is that both have a similar mathematical structure in general relativity in the simplest models. Namely both phenomenon result in an inflationary universe called de Sitter spacetime. The difference being that during inflation the &quot;cosmological constant&quot; was enormous for a very brief amount of time. Dark energy is comparison is quite small and has only manifest as the dominant form of energy in the universe over the last few billion years as matter and radiation density has dropped.</p>
<p>The &quot;cosmological constant&quot; in inflation has to also decay in the end, otherwise inflation leads to a cold dead universe. Inflationary spacetimes supercool the matter and radiation within them and severely dilute density. It is only when the &quot;inflaton field&quot; (whatever it may be) dies all the energy density tied up in it becomes matter and radiation reheating the universe to a hot dense state. Dark energy doesn't seem to have this decay feature and seems to be stable, which means it perpetually acts to further cool and dilute the universe.</p>
<p>This is highly speculative, but if the two phenomenon are actually related, then dark energy might be the residual ground state (or leftovers) of the original high energy inflationary field. Or they're entirety unrelated, lots of physics can behave like a cosmological constant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To make explicit what u/Lewri hinted at, researchers have come up with theories where the same quintessence scalar field causes both inflation in the early Universe and late-time accelerated expansion (i.e. taking the role of dark energy), removing the need for a cosmological constant. This class of theories was imaginatively named Quintessential Inflation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is not a big enough topic to have its own Wikipedia page, but you could try reading the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.59.063505" target="_blank">original paper</a> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9810509" target="_blank">preprint</a>) or <a href="https://doi.org/10.1142/S0218271815300141" target="_blank">this overview</a> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.6100" target="_blank">preprint</a>). However, these are both aimed at an expert audience so may assume a high base level of knowledge. This <a href="https://doi.org/10.17635/lancaster/thesis/625" target="_blank">PhD thesis</a> on Quintessential Inflation should start from a more basic level.  </p>
<p>As far as I'm aware, there is no overwhelming evidence that Quintessential Inflation is more favoured by data and observations than the traditional idea of inflation and dark energy being separate phenomena, but it is still an area of active research so this may change in the future.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
