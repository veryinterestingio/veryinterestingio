<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/antarctic-bottom-water" target="_blank">Antarctic Bottom Water (ABW)</a> is a good example. ABW is the leftover water after sea ice forms on the surface. As sea ice forms from nearly pure water, the leftover is has high salt concentration compared to surrounding sea water, and is therefore denser. Because it is very cold and very dense, it sinks to the very bottom of the ocean and very slowly spreads out from Antarctica (possibly over hundreds of years). As sea ice forms in the winter, ABW also has a seasonal signal, at least near to formation sites, and therefore, so should the deep ocean in a sense.</p>
<p>I guess as you get further away from Antarctica, that cyclic signal will correlate less with what's happening at the surface.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It greatly depends where on Earth you are.</p>
<p>In the middle of the Atlantic and Pacific gyres bottom water is pretty unaffected by seasonal changes in surface waters. </p>
<p>Marine snow from the surface and mid-water ecosystems will be so strongly attenuated that strong seasonal peaks in productivity won't really be experienced at 3-5km depth.</p>
<p>This is due to all the grazing by metazoan zooplankton and heterotrophic protists  and recycling of organic and inorganic compounds by bacteria though the water column. Things are very different in the seas on continental shelves.</p>
<p>The deep ocean has an extremely stable temperature, such that measuring differences in bottom water temperature requires sensors accurate to hunderedths of a degree. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I teach graduate level courses in physical oceanography and the answer to your question is yes. There is a strong seasonality in deep ocean currents because of the seasonality in the wind forcing.  The direct effect of wind forcing is called Ekman transport and since the winds vary at different places the amount of Ekman transport also varies primarily as a function of time and longitude for a given ocean basin. There is a strong seasonal signal in the wind forcing.  There are areas where there is a net convergence (divergence) of water that form high (low) pressure systems in the ocean from this direct wind forcing. These pressure systems also change the pressure at great ocean depths and hence force the currents.   Here is a link to just one of the many papers on this,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/295193a0" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/295193a0</a></p>
<p>Mafiafish is right about the strong seasonal signal of nutrient and sediment fluxes to the deep ocean. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am really surprised such a BS answer from a climate change denier is top. </p>
<p>OP, no, the deep ocean beyond the continental shelf is quite stable...its always cold, always dark, and aside from rare whale falls or hydrothermal vents, its nutrient poor.  Currents are minimal compared to the top, with the except of SOME upwelling areas and slow moving density currents (which I don't think change much seasonally to cause appreciable changes in the biotic communities).  </p>
<p>However, there are seasonal changes that occur in the photic zone in the ocean ocean (above the deep sea) but a lot of that production that occurs gets used up by organisms that live there and only a small fraction makes it down as marine snow. From my understanding, the seasonal differences in this isn't enough to cause major abiotic changes in the deep seas thousands of feet below. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
