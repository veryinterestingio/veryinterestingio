		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Planetary rings eventually settle to a disk aligned with the axis of rotation due mostly to the large gravitational field of the planet and partially the conservation of momentum of the particles orbiting the planet.</p>
<p>To start, the planet's gravitational field dominates the area immediately around it.  The planet will capture a cloud of small particles into stable orbits around itself.  This capture is the beginning of a formation of the rings.  As time goes on, the particles will collide with each other, dissipating some of their energy in the process.  Some particles will lose enough energy to fall to the planet, while the others will spread out further away from the planet.  The important phenomenon taking over at this point is the conservation of angular momentum.</p>
<p>The planet's rotation speed and mass combined with the mass of the cloud of particles captured within the planet's influence create a closed system (small amounts of mass can be added but is ignored here for simplicity).  Therefore the closed system has a set amount of angular momentum which is calculated using the mass, velocity, and distance away from rotational axis.  The natural equilibrium (and lowest energy state) for a rotating object is the plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation.  </p>
<p>In our cloud of particles surrounding the planet, we focus on a certain particle.  We will examine it at a point in time of its orbit when it is above the plane perpendicular (equator from here out).  At this point in time, more of the planet's mass is pulling it back toward the equator.  If it never collides with another particle and we ignore drag, it would oscillate forever to the same distance north and south of the equator, or same latitude.  But since there is a cloud of other particles it will collide and lose energy, falling towards the lowest energy state which is the disk stated before.  Given enough time and collisions all particles will settle to this state.  All other particles either gain enough energy to break the gravitational hold of the  planet or fall back to the surface of the planet.  The planets we currently see with rings have had enough time (millions of years) for their cloud of particles to settle to this state of equilibrium.</p>
<p>A fun tidbit here says the Earth will eventually form a ring system around itself due to the amount of debris currently orbiting it in the form of satellites.  Eventually the satellites will have enough collisions and create enough debris to create a runaway debris field called the Kessler syndrome.  At the worst case the area surrounding Earth will have enough debris that we can no longer access the orbits due to the damage caused by the debris.  Over time gravity and the collisions will take over and the Earth will form its own rings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The rotating body bulges at the equator. This is called oblatness. The bulge is mass and has gravity. The effect on satellites around Earth result in them having to perform maneuvers and the region is called J2 on Earth if you'd like to read about it. It's complicated to understand what is happening mathematically but searching &quot;Earth J2&quot; will take you down the rabbit hole if you're interested.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An orbit around a planet must orbit the actual centre of gravity of the planet (which is pretty much the centre of the planet).</p>
<p>Take a ball and put a hoop around it.  You can move the hoop around the ball any way you want so long as the centre of the hoop and the centre of the ball are in the same place.  This shows any possible orbit around the ball.</p>
<p>We have satellites orbiting earth at all sorts of angles, from directly over the equator to orbiting over both poles.  (They are all at different altitudes or far enough apart that they would collide).</p>
<p>If you were to have multiple rings form on any other plane apart from the equator then these ring would have to intersect, and thus the contents of the rings would smash into each other.  The rings wouldn't be stable.</p>
<p>Also the rotation of the planet would affect the rings over (a very long) time too, &quot;pulling&quot; the rings with it, so if one could form at a different angle it would be swept along into a ring over the equator.</p>
<p>The only stable place for rings to form is directly above the equator of the planet.  And that's the only place we have found rings on any planet that has them (Saturn, Neptune, Jupiter, and Uranus).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR - The rings usually predate the planet they orbit, and tidal forces stop the stuff from sticking together enough to Moon up.</p>
<p>The planets rotate on the axis they do because of the average kinetic energy of the particles that made them, and that only accretes after particle interactions in the local environment have reduced perturbations in the cloud enough for the object to accumulate; i.e. after anything violently out of whack with the average kinetic energy of the cloud has been brought in line through interaction. Once a big enough object accretes, it can safely absorb tidal energy as heat whilst smaller objects may not be able to resist its tidal pull and will thus get ripped apart, staying as rings.</p>
<p>Ok. Layman terms.</p>
<p>You have a huge, sparse cloud of particles, lets say rice, floating around inside a pot of water. All this rice is trying move in random directions and with random speeds, but all grains are attracted to each other through gravity.</p>
<p>Every time 2 objects move closer to each other, they experience attractive acceleration. They bend each other's direction and speed slightly, based on their respective momentum, and if 2 grains approach close enough, with very low relative speed, they may end up sticking together. This gives them greater ability to resist changes in speed and momentum, and to change the speed and momentum of objects they interact with.</p>
<p>Over a colossally long time, more and more grains accumulate, catch other grains in orbits or decaying orbits, and you get an averaging out of all the momentums of each rice grain. Anything that deviates steadily loses its deviation by slightly affecting the larger particles around it, and those lose their deviations by interacting with the large particles around them. It'll involve a lot of clumping and splitting up as rice balls get hit by other rice balls, but the end result is everything moving roughly the same way, like 2 cars in a collision. Any excess energy can also be absorbed by imparting extra rotation to the rice balls, or absorbed by the balls themselves as heat (this is what causes metal to bend and cars to spin while colliding).</p>
<p>Congratulations! What you have now is what's called an accretion disk. Basically, everything is spinning in roughly the same way, on roughly the same plane, and so the chaos has slowed down enough for some really BIG clumps to form. This is roughly what the early solar system looked like, with all the wildest stuff having collided and fallen into the sun; everything left outside had conformed enough to survive. Just like happened with Earth and a roughly Mars-sized object way back, you occasionally get 2 big clumps trying to occupy the same orbital space around the centre of mass of the system, and collisions will cause new clumps to form of different sizes. That's how we got the moon!</p>
<p>Over a long enough time scale, that will create a few large objects that still interact with each other, but occupy most of their region, and have so much mass that anything trying to clump up near them will experience tidal forces (1 side is closer to the planet than the other and so feels more attraction) that tear the objects apart. These tidal forces happen because the objects aren't perfect spheres, so the side that sticks out a bit gets slightly closer to the planet, experiences more attraction, absorbs a bit of energy by being bent and pulled around, and slowly, very slowly, starts to settle facing the planet. We only see one side of them moon because that side of the moon is the bulgy bit.</p>
<p>This is why the asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars exist (Jupiter &amp; Sun interactions ripped everything bigger than Ceres apart), and why Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune happen to be the 4 largest planets and also the only one with rings. They have enough mass to cause tidal forces that destabilise objects close to them, so without enough mass in a given very small space, it can't form a moon. This is because sticking together requires quite a lot of attraction to other parts, and if you don't slam together violently, melting things and causing proper accretion, your confetti-weak bonding will get pulled apart by the tides if there's big enough objects nearby.</p>
<p>This doesn't dig in to stuff like orbital resonances, like how Pluto and Neptune can never collide because Pluto orbits twice for every 3 Neptune does and so will never get close enough for tides to kill Pluto and Charon, but it gives you the gist of why orbital rings exist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
