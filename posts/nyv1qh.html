		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's my understanding that as pieces of &quot;stuff&quot; dissolve or disintegrate into smaller pieces the process accelerates as the surface area/volume ratio changes. It seems like plastics in the ocean have broken down into &quot;micro&quot; sized pieces then just... stopped? Is there some fundamental unit of plastic which plastic products are breaking down into that have different properties to the plastic product as a whole, and don't disintegrate the same way?</p>
<p>Bonus question I only thought of while trying to phrase this question correctly - what is the process that causes plastics to disintegrate in the ocean? Chemically dissolving? Mechanically eroding like rocks into sand?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's 2 different but related types of &quot;breaking down&quot;. One is the type of breaking down which converts plastic polymers into water, CO2 and biomass which are relatively harmless, usually this is biodegradation done by microbes. </p>
<p>Then there's degradation which is usually physical wear and tear and breaking down of larger polymer chains to smaller ones with relatively similar properties through abiotic physical/cheimcal processes (UV breakdown, heat, chemical reasons, etc). </p>
<p>Both these processes exist for plastics, but for the plastics we don't call &quot;biodegradable plastics&quot; or bioplastics etc, the biodegradation process is extremely slow. So they deteriorate mostly using the latter process, still maintaining their plastic properties and due to their resistance to biological processes and to an extent physical processes, they accumulate. </p>
<p>Because they are resistant and accumulate while breaking into smaller pieces, they disrupt animal functions, develop large effective surface area to transport presistent organic pollutants and eventually come back to us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plastic molecules tend to be fairly long.<br />
Decomposer microbes tend to break things down by either engulfing them or secreting decomposing enzymes on to the surface of their food.   </p>
<p>Plastic molecules tend to be too large for microbes to engulf.
Most decomposer microbes haven’t evolved specialized enzymes to take apart the long plastic molecules because they are so long.   Eventually decomposer microbes will evolve enzymes to do this, but it could take thousands of years.  </p>
<p>Waxworm larvae and mealworms have evolved enzymes that can decompose polyethylene (waxworms) and polystyrene (mealworms) so it is possible.  </p>
<p>Some decomposer microbes in landfills all around the world are also starting to evolve enzymes to decompose plastics, but an official collection and identification of these microbes hasn’t been completed yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two kinds of degradation that are relevant here: physical/mechanical degradation (breaking into smaller pieces) and chemical degradation (breaking the bonds in plastic to release harmless compounds).</p>
<p>Physical/mechanical degradation happens as plastic is bumped around its environment via erosion - a scratch here, a shaving there... Eventually it gets eroded until it's too small to see (into a microplastic). But this doesn't &quot;destroy&quot; the plastic, it just splits it into innumerable tiny pieces that persist in the environment and may eventually make their way back into organisms.</p>
<p>Chemical degradation is what ultimately &quot;destroys&quot; plastic and renders it harmless by turning it into water and carbon dioxide. &quot;Biodegradable&quot; plastics do this readily and are basically eaten by bacteria. However, being chemically degradable means the plastic is <em>designed to degrade</em>, so it has a limit to how long it will exist until atmospheric moisture and contaminating microbes degrade it.</p>
<p>Beyond this, different plastics have different bonding characteristics that determine their structures and degradability. &quot;Recyclable&quot; plastics tend to be made from collections of long chain plastic polymers that, when heated, separate and can be re-molded. Think of it like a hemp rope - you can pull off individual fibers from it since they're not really connected. Non-recyclable plastics tend to consist of chemically cross-linked plastics so that the entire plastic is more or less one giant molecule. This interconnected plastic network is also much more resistant to degradation!</p>
<p>The only &quot;sure&quot; way to destroy plastic is to burn it (which can release some nasty gases if you don't go out of your way to capture and neutralize them) or to make it biodegradable. The problem with the existing microplastics is they're not biodegradable, so we expect to see them start to get incorporated into the food chain and affect organisms. Like all pollutants, the higher up the food chain you are, the more microplastics you will ingest (from prey that have already ingested it). And once it's in your body, there's really no way to get rid of it... It's a scary problem that really can't go away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have studied how rocks in space break down over time. (Think rings of Saturn.) Interestingly the behavior is similar. Very large rocks break down very slowly, and very small rocks (dust) break down very slowly. The maximum speed of breakdown is actually in the medium sized rocks (pebble to meter sized).</p>
<p>I am sure the actual physics is completely different, but we can still transfer the general trends. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Big rocks/large plastic items only slowly break down over time because there is too much space/ocean between them. Basically, the chance of two things colliding is very slim.</li>
<li>Medium rocks/plastic pieces are usually created by the rare collisions of big rock/large items. Which means that if you get them, you get lots of them in the same place. Thus, the chance of colliding is high and they break down very fast.</li>
<li>Small rocks(dust)/Microplastic are create by the medium rocks/plastic pieces. These are even more numerous than the medium rocks/pieces so they constantly smash into each other. However, due to their small size not much energy is in these collisions. The smaller the dust/microplastic gets the less energy is usable to break down further. Basically, if dust/particles get small enough collision might make them slightly hotter, but cannot break them down any further.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is tons of things I have left out of this discussion. Please let me know if you would like more details on things.</p>
<p>TL;DR: The smaller the plastic, the less energy is available in collisions to break them down further.</p>
<p><em>EDIT:</em> I just noticed, I forgot to answer the second part of your question. Some plastics get converted into other substances by UV light, ocean water and/or microbes. However, what we usually call microplastic is stuff that either does not break down naturally at all, or on the order of thousands of years. The only thing this plastic can do is being ground down into finer powder. That's why being in smaller size does not help with breakdown. In a way it behaves like very fine sand. The difference being that microplastic is bouyant (does not sink to the ocean floor) and it contains micro amounts of additives (for colour, softness, UV resistance, ...) which are toxic to lots of lifeforms. This by the way is what makes it dangerous.wiithout the additives it would be much less harmful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
