		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Palm trees and bamboo are both types of grass that grow very tall, but I guess you're talking about common grass you see every day.</p>
<p>It ultimately depends on the structure the organism has developed over time. A hard outer structure is needed to support itself, and the grass in your garden doesn't have that. It wouldn't be worth attempting to grow too tall, because it would collapse under its own weight and die. Lawn grass is everywhere, and easy to grow, because it's smaller and doesn't waste valuable nutrition of developing a hard outer layer</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd also like to think this height limit on grass is the same sort of height limit on trees (I can't remember if there's a term for this). </p>
<p>Trees, depending on type, also stop at around the same height. The farther from the ground and higher the plant grows, the more work and less energy the plant gets. Water and nutrients get pulled up by capillaries while gravity tries to work against them. By the time the plant gets too high, the harder it is for the water and nutrients to continue feeding the higher branches (a tree that never stopped growing may have unhealthy tops as they receive little water and nutrients as they are being used by lower branches) so the plant conserves what would be more beneficial by having a growth limit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
