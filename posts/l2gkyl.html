		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh boy. The neuroscience of concentration, which is under the umbrella of what neuroscience calls &quot;attention&quot; is extremely complicated. It's very difficult to define, and because it's hard to define it's hard to test. </p>
<p>You're asking about what we call top-down attention. And the one you're talking about is near-impossible to test. When you think about something without moving, there's no way we can examine it short of neural imaging. In neural imaging we can only see what's parts of the brain are most energetic but we can't know why or how it's happening. Different kinds of top down attention will require different parts of the brain. Is it math? Music? COD? Meditation? Each one requires a vastly different network of brain activity. And if brain activity is the only thing we can look at to check attention, we don't have much going for us at all. </p>
<p>There are a couple super broad commonalities of how top down attention works. One commonality of top down attention is that they all involve the front outer part of your brain called the frontal cortex, some way some how.  Other aspect of top down attention is that the brain will selectively begin to filter out irrelevant info to make the thing you want easier to &quot;focus on.&quot; Depending on what you're trying to focus on, the mechanisms will be very different. </p>
<p>Unfortunately it only gets murkier from there. You're asking about &quot;complex matters.&quot; Some neuroscientists will say that tracking a triangle as it moves through a bunch of wiggly lines is complex. Others will say lifting an arm is complex. Other people will say math is more complex. </p>
<p>Then there's the philosophical issue. Whoever in the brain making the decision is sometimes nicknamed the &quot;mover unmoved.&quot; In other words, it's the theoretical thing in the brain that isn't being controlled by something else. In a world where every action is the product of another action, does that truly exist? If not, maybe there's no such thing as deciding to pay attention at all. </p>
<p>If youre interested in ADD, however, I can try to explain in the comments how its not a simply concentration problem either. </p>
<p>TLDR: No one knows</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
