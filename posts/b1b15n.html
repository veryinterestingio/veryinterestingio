		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey I worked on the ISS thermal control systems. The station is essentially cooled by a water cooler like you see in high end PCs. All of the computers and systems are on cold plates where heat is transferred into water. This is necessary because without gravity air cooling doesn’t work well. The warmed water is pumped to heat exchangers where the energy is transferred into ammonia. The ammonia is pumped through several large radiators where the heat is “shined” into space via infrared. The radiators can be moved to optimize the heat rejection capability. The reason the radiators are so large is that this is a really inefficient method but it’s the only way that works in space. </p>
<p>The reason we use water first and then ammonia is that ammonia is deadly to people. The ammonia loop is separate from the water loop and located outside the station. However if there were to be a heat exchanger breach high pressure ammonia would get into the water loops and into the cabin. That would be the end of the station essentially. We had a false alarm in 2015, scary day. </p>
<p>Just realized that I didn’t answer the question completely. Any heat generated by the astronauts themselves would be removed from the air via the ECLSS. It’s not really an issue though. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do this thought experiment:</p>
<p>A blob of molten white hot metal blinks into existence somewhere in the universe, far away from any star.  What happens?  Does it stay white hot forever?</p>
<p>Actually, no.  It will slowly cool, and the glowing will diminish as it does.  It's releasing its energy via photons; thermal radiation.</p>
<p>Will it continue cooling until it reaches <em>absolute zero?</em></p>
<p>Actually, no.  It will stabilize around 3 degrees kelvin.  You see, the whole time it's been sitting there releasing thermal energy, it's also been <em>absorbing</em> thermal energy from its surroundings.  If it was near a star, it would stay hotter, but since our blob is out in the middle of nowhere, it's just the cosmic background radiation's dim glow shining on it.  At around 3 degrees, the thermal energy being given off will be the same as the energy being absorbed.</p>
<p>The space station has cooling circuits, not dissimilar to a refrigerator or air conditioner.  Fluid is pumped through large radiator panels.  They are motorized, to keep them pointed away from the sun (and ideally also away from the earth and moon).  Idea is to keep them pointed at deep space, so they will radiate more than they absorb.  Spacecraft designers often place radiators on surfaces perpendicular to the solar panels; that way if the solar array is pointed straight at the sun, which is ideal, then the radiator is edge on to the sun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thermal radiation does not require a medium to transfer energy. Heat is transferred as energy in the form of photons, which actually travel until they hit matter, making radiation even more powerful in vacuum. In atmosphere, the most significant means of heat transfer is convection, equalizing heat between neighboring, ever moving molecules of air or water. Radiation also takes place in atmosphere, it usually is just less significant.</p>
<p>A simple example is an open fire outdoors. Sitting nearby, you will get warm very quickly, even when the fire won't be able to heat the air between it and you. That's because the radiated heat is hitting you, exciting your surface molecules to move and thus get warmer.</p>
<p>A slightly bigger example is the sun heating the Earth. That is radiative heat transfer you enjoy every day at the beach.</p>
<p>Almost all spacecrafts have to implement cooling solutions. Electronics and sensors on satellites can generate tremendous heat. The cooling concept is similar to what is used on Earth in cars, fridges or ACs: closed fluid loops gather the heat where it appears and then spread it in a large surface radiator to be radiated away. The only difference is that many Earth radiators are built to benefit from convection as well.</p>
<p>The ISS has the big advantage of being big: it already has a tremendous surface area and constantly loses temperature. As such, it actually requires active heating to stay comfortable. But same as satellites, some systems or experiments that risk overheating need cooling, usually done in individual cooling loops.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this allows for dual use of solar panels. They have a huge surface area by necessity. By embedding cooling loops in them, you can shed plenty of heat during night time or by positioning the panels perpendicular to the sun. As the panels heat up a lot themselves when exposed to solar radiation, this requires a careful balance or schedule.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By radiation. As long as the ISS is not enclosed and have the radiated heat get reflected back at them, the ISS will cool down.</p>
<p>But we dont want the whole place to be at the same temperature because it might be too hot to live in so the trick is moving the heat so that certain parts get to an ok temperature and in the other part taht we dont need to care too much about the temperature will hold onto the heat for a moment while it slowly radiates the heat into space. Think about a refrigerator. The back is hot because the heat from inside the fridge is sent outside.</p>
<p>Things also radiate heat depending on how hot it is. The hotter, the more it radiates it away</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
