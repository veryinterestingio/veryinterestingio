Does this mean that at some point in the distant future we will actually be able to see it with the naked eye, and what would this look like?

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Redshift&quot; means that the wavelengths get longer, and microwaves are already longer wavelength than visible light, so no, it won't ever become visible (barring a Big Crunch scenario, but that is pretty much excluded by cosmological data). </p>
<p>The CMB radiation currently peaks at about a wavelength of 1 mm (10^-3 meters), while the longest-wavelength light that our eyes can see is around 750 nm (7.5 x 10^-7 meters). </p>
<p>When the CMB was emitted, the universe was at a temperature of 3000 K, which is a little hotter than your typical incandescent light bulb, so the emitted light was mostly in the visible and near-infrared, and would look like a warm yellowish glow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Adding on a little bit to the excellent answer by /u/Das_Mime, it should be noted that the in the pictures of what the current CMB &quot;looks like&quot;, the high contrast colors are exaggerating the temperature differences.  For example, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background#/media/File:WMAP_2010.png" target="_blank">this picture</a> the difference between the red and blue represents only 0.0002 degrees difference.  To the eye, back when it was visible, it would have appeared completely uniform.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Note that there is actually a way to make the CMB visible: by travelling fast enough that it is heavily blueshifted. <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/156318/could-i-see-the-cosmic-microwave-background-if-it-were-doppler-shifted-enough" target="_blank">This kind person</a> has calculated that the CMB would be visible and quite bright when travelling at 0.99999835c - and would appear as a completely uniform white light. This is conveniently quite close to the top speed of particles in the SPS particle accelerator (~0.999998c).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
