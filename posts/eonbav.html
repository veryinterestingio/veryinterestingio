		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As living things (that is, single or multicellular organisms) go about their day, the chemical processes inside of them produce hydrogen peroxide as a waste product. </p>
<p>Hydrogen peroxide damages the delicate molecular machinery inside cells, so, natural selection led to the evolution of something called <em>catalase</em>. </p>
<p>Catalase is an <em>enzyme</em>—the very first ever to be discovered. As an enzyme, catalase helps make certain chemical reactions occur. Specifically, catalase’s job is to detoxify the hydrogen peroxide that cells make. It does this by splitting hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. </p>
<p>Because the chemical production of hydrogen peroxide as a waste product occurs in basically all living things, basically all living things have catalase inside them. So, when hydrogen peroxide bubbles, that’s telling you that it has come in contact with the insides of living things (be they you, a potato, bacteria, or anything else), and the catalase in those living things is doing its job. </p>
<p>I actually used this once to save my neighbor’s life, in 2013 or 2014 or thereabouts. She had accidentally drunken a bottle of hydrogen peroxide, rather than water. She came over to our house asking for help, and I—remembering an experiment we did with catalase in my AP Biology class, chopped up some raw potato we had sitting in the kitchen, and got her to eat the pieces. She soon started burping as the catalase inside the potato chunks got to work detoxifying the hydrogen peroxide she’s swallowed. </p>
<p>I can honestly say I heard the Elder Scrolls games’ “skill level increase” that day, as my Alchemy skill went up several points for having saved my neighbor’s life. :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s a chemical reaction to organic matter. I t’s like digesting, breaking off its particles. A good example is a blood stained cloth. Immerse it in  peroxide and all blood fizzes and comes out of the clothes’ threads. Blood oxidizes. In wounds, it removes the blood and cleans the skin; but also  removes some of the live tissue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
