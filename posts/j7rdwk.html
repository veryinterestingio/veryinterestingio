<p>A cut does not send the body into shock, so in the right spot and the right depth could be deadly. </p>

<p>When a vein or artery is severed there are a few protective measures inside of the body to stop bleeding. One that most people are familiar with is platelets and clotting. But there are also muscles that surround the vessel which control dilation. When the vessel is severed these muscles contract to slow the flow of blood through them. There are also sphincters which control blood flow in and out of the capillary beds. Lastly vessels are “stretched  “ (under tension) to their attachment points. </p>
<p>When a vessel is dissected (long transverse cut) these protection measures cannot kick in. The muscles are circular so they cannot contract to close the wound. The vessel remains stretched so it cannot collapse on itself. </p>
<p>With an amputation these measures tend to kick in and limit the amount of blood loss. The vessel contracts back toward the body making it narrower, the muscles contract making it yet smaller. Hopefully with this the pressure at the end of the vessel is low enough that the clotting factors can kick in a stop the blood flow completely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People who lost a limb do not always have it completely severed. Usually the effected limb is damaged enough that it won't heal and isn't repairable but still attached. If the major arteries aren't damaged then the person is likely to survive long enough to get medical care. The part of the limb that is too damaged to save is removed at the hospital.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally? Time until treatment. Modern amputations are generally done in a medical setting where the tools to stop the bleeding immediately are ready and waiting before the surgeons start the operation. </p>
<p>In an accident where a major artery is severed, you have maybe a minute to get medical care before you lose too much blood and die. You can extend this with emergency medical care, like putting pressure on the wound or a tourniquet if it’s in a good spot for it, but at most you’ll extend your time to a few minutes. </p>
<p>In an attempted suicide, the person usually makes sure they’re alone where no one will find them and call for help, sometimes even cutting off their own lines of help in case they get cold feet after the deed is done. They don’t have to cut quite as deeply, because they can have hours to bleed out alone before anyone finds them. As long as the wound keeps bleeding, they’ll likely fall unconscious long before they’re dead, or even past the point where it would be difficult to save them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>what you are seeing is survivorship bias. you only see the amputees that survive thus you consider that they all survive....</p>
<p>a medical amputation is well planned and managed surgery with multiple measures in place to limit bloodloss and seal arteries/veins. an accidental or traumatic amputation is a very different, VERY dangerous situation where despite natural instincts such as shock acting to limit blood flow, death is not that uncommon.</p>
<p>a lower arm/hand amputee will have a much higher likelihood of survival by comparison to an upper arm, and an upper leg traumatic amputation would be nearly un-survivable without immediate assistance and great luck.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
