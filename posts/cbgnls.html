<p>[Geologist here, keeping the seat warm until an astronomer arrives]</p>
<p>There is a distance from the centre of a planet called the Roche Limit inside of which objects can't accumulate to form moons.  </p>
<p>Very simply, a particle in a lower orbit (closer to the planet) feels a slightly greater gravitational pull from the planet than a particle further out - so there is a force pulling the pair apart. If this tidal force is greater than the gravitational pull between the two particles, they will separate from one another. </p>
<p>The majority of Saturn's rings lie inside the planet's Roche Limit so they can only ever disperse. The two outer rings are outside of the limit so their origin is less certain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The short version is that the tidal stresses limit the size of the moonlets in Saturn's ring.  The moonlets do collect material, but the tidal stresses break them apart again.</p>
<p>Edit: The video isn't available for streaming in my area.  But I did watch it on Netflix recently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>tl;dr The rings of Saturn have already formed moons that have evolved tidally away from Saturn.</p>
<p>Saturn's rings cannot directly form a moon because they are within Saturn's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit" target="_blank">Roche limit</a>, which is to say that they are too close in to the planet and Saturn's strong tides pull any potential moon apart before it can form. However, the material in Saturn's rings is spreads out through a process called &quot;<a href="http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/doc.cfm?fobjectid=50717" target="_blank">viscous dissipation</a>&quot;. Some of the material spreads outwards from the planet, and some inwards and falls into the planet.</p>
<p>As the material spreads outwards, it passes the Roche limit and becomes far enough away to coalesce into a moon. The moons that form then migrate away from Saturn through tidal interactions (just as our moon is migrating away from the Earth). <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Saturn%27s_Rings_PIA03550.jpg/1920px-Saturn%27s_Rings_PIA03550.jpg" target="_blank">See this image of Saturn's closest moons from Wikipedia</a>. Dione (or possibly Rhea, some would argue) was the first moon to be formed from Saturn's rings back when the rings were much more massive. This left less mass in the rings for the next moon to form, so the next moon is likely to be smaller.</p>
<p>Noting that Saturn is about 4.6 Gyr old (same age as the solar system), we calculated a rough tidal migration timescales for some of these moons in a class that I took last Spring. We got 9.14 Gyr for Rhea, 2.18 Gyr for Dione, 773 Myr for Tethys, 1.09 Gyr for Enceladus, and 593 Myr for Mimas. Note that Enceladus may be older than Tethys, but is closer in to Saturn. This is because more massive moons experience stronger tidal migration, and also because we know that Enceladus is losing mass through geologic activity (and is the source of Saturn's outer E ring) which complicates the calculation in a way that we did not address. From this, we can conclude that many of these moons must have formed at the Roche limit from rings or similar debris and migrated outwards.</p>
<p>The equation used was T = 2(a_s ^(13/2) - a_0 ^(13/2)) / (39 (k_2^t / Q) sqrt(G/M) m_s R^5) where T is the timescale, a_s is the satellite's semimajor axis, a_0 is the roche limit (original semimajor axis), k_2^t is the tidal love number, Q is the tidal quality number, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of Saturn, m_s is the mass of the satellite, and R is Saturn's radius. We also neglected the fact that the moons may have continued forming and agglomerating after leaving the Roche-zone, as well as satellite-satellite interactions via resonances, and other potential complications.</p>
<p>Currently, more material from Saturn's rings are falling in towards the planet than is migrating away from the planet. This is believed to be (in part) because of &quot;pollution&quot; from micrometeorites. Saturn's rings are dominantly made of ices, and micrometeorites are dominantly silicate in composition. Micrometeorites increase the mass of Saturn's rings, but not necessarily the angular momentum. This decreases the angular momentum per unit mass, causing material to spiral inwards faster than viscous dissipation would cause on its own. Looking at the current pollution levels of Saturn's rings, they cannot be more than a few hundred million years old. This action, combined with &quot;ring shepherding&quot; from Saturn's other moons, means that future moons forming from Saturn's rings will likely be very small, if they form at all.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that there are some small moons and &quot;propeller-like&quot; bodies within Saturn's rings themselves. <a href="http://solarviews.com/images/PIA06237.jpg" target="_blank">Here is an image of Daphnis, one such moon within the rings, creating waves in the surrounding ring material due to gravitational interactions</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Saturn and Neptune’s rings exist because they are within the planets Roche limit. Meaning a celestial body that is held together by its own gravity (a moon) is torn apart by a second celestial bodies tidal forces, in this case from Saturn. They cannot form into a moon quick enough before they are broken down. I assume existing moons of Saturn came from outside and fell in to Saturn’s Roche limit and will eventually break down and become smaller component parts of the rings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
