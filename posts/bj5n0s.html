But surely, it has to stop somewhere, right? Or else wide swaths of the cosmos could be claimed in the name of, say, Australia or something (edit: which brings out problems involving the Earth's rotation/movement in space).</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In international law, the space above a particular national territory is treated as belonging to the government controlling the territory, and is called the country's &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace" target="_blank">Airspace</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>A country's Airspace does not include Outer Space, which, under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty" target="_blank"><em>Outer Space Treaty of 1967</em></a>, is declared to be &quot;free and not subject to national appropriation&quot;. However, the treaty did not define the altitude at which Airspace ends and Outer Space begins. </p>
<p>While there is no international agreement on the vertical extent of sovereign Airspace, suggestions range from about 30 km (19 mi)—the altitude of the highest aircraft and balloons—to about 160 km (99 mi)—the altitude of the lowest short-term stable orbits. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_A%C3%A9ronautique_Internationale" target="_blank"><em>Fédération Aéronautique Internationale</em></a> has established the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line" target="_blank">Kármán line</a>—at an altitude of 100 km (62 mi)—as the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and Outer Space. </p>
<p><strong>ADDENDUM</strong> <em>The Kármán line was calculated on the understanding that above a certain altitude the atmosphere would be so thin that a flying aircraft would have to fly faster than orbital velocity in order to get any aerodynamic lift, and if you are flying faster than orbital velocity you're not really flying anymore.</em></p>
<p>The United States considers anyone who has flown above 80 kilometers (50 mi) to be an astronaut.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>(As far as I can work out Pluto has never been as far north as New Mexico since it was declassified, and I don't think it ever will be).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't recall the exact figure, but it's generally considered to be the edge if earth's atmosphere. This is roughly 100 miles.</p>
<p>Once you get into &quot;space&quot; the area becomes defined by several international treaties that essentially boil down to &quot;no one owns any of this and isn't allowed to either&quot;. </p>
<p>This has some problems, as the way it stands this means that mineral exploitation of places like the asteroid belt and other planetary bodies is against treaty law. Private corporations and nations alike are considered bound by this, though as far as I know there is little to no enforcement provisions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
