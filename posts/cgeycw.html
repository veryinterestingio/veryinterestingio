How much does this localization vary between people? I'm interested in learning more about the variance in the location as we as size of brain regions.</p>

<p>As a follow-up question, I would be very interested to learn what is known about variance of functional specialization in other animals as well.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a neuroscientist who works on this very question, mostly in the context of speech and language abilities and how their functional organization differs in developmental communication disorders. First of all, I think this a super interesting question that has mostly hard answers, and it depends a lot on the scale at which you're asking the question. But a tl;dr might be <em>&quot;the functional organization of human brains differ in small ways, but not usually in big ways&quot;</em></p>
<p>First, let's look at anatomical variability. Compared to many other species, including other mammals, human brains are highly variable in shape. The precise location major neuroanatomical features, for instance, are variable across individuals. But these features nonetheless tend to be present in (almost) all individuals. Here is an example of variation in the anatomical location of superior temporal sulcus, a key area in speech and language:
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.01.023" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.01.023</a>
An even more stunning example can be seen in the location and anatomy of Heschl's gyrus, which is where we find primary auditory cortex. Some people have 1, some people have 2, and some people have 1.5. And it might differ within person between the left and right hemisphere. But we always find primary auditory cortex here, not somewhere else (like the frontal or occipital lobes), so again the answer is something like &quot;local but not global&quot; variation:
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00429-013-0680-x" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1007/s00429-013-0680-x</a></p>
<p>Turning to functional organization of these regions, the story is similar. Large functionally-defined areas (language areas, face areas, voice areas, motor areas, working memory areas, etc) tend to be roughly in the same place from person to person, but there is local variation in the functional neuroanatomy. Here are some great examples with respect to the location of neural processing of voices:
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811915005558" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811915005558</a>
and language:
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20410363" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20410363</a>
and faces (and places and objects):
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.02.055" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.02.055</a></p>
<p>But these differences in functional organization are not necessarily totally random, and may be related to individual differences in anatomical structure. For instance, there is some evidence that we can predict, using the anatomical structure, the location of specific cortical functions (e.g., face processing, word reading) with high degree of accuracy, suggesting that the structure-function correspondence is tightly linked in the brain, notwithstanding apparent spatial variability across brains:

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s difficult to functionally characterize the human brain and like many neuroscientist I tend to be skeptical of findings in fMRI as it observes a correlate of metabolic activity rather than neural activity itself.  However, the field has developed our most advanced methods for warping one brain onto another based on anatomy, and has had quite a bit of success with this method. Nonetheless, we know from lesion studies that Broca’s area, involved in speech production, usually appears in the left hemisphere but sometimes appears on the right,  and this is probably just scraping the surface.
As you start talking about more detailed features, like the layout of various orientation selective columns in V1, I don’t believe it is still possible to warp one brain onto another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Essentially, functional localization is relatively standard, right up until it can't be any more. Even with half a brain missing, a lot of function can be reorganized to the remaining areas. That's not just an artifact of the surgery: most hemispherectomies are only performed when the excised lobe was already essentially dead to begin with, and function was already localized to the contralateral half of the brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many individual differences between people in terms of exact localization of function, but in general, we are all organizationally similar.  For example, we all have the same visual cortices, and in generally the same places, but the exact locations and neural density do differ.  This is due to both experience (the brain records information through structural changes as well as synaptic changes i.e. Hebb) and genetics. You and I are going to use V1 (primary visual cortex) the same way, but your V1 and my V1 are not identical. Some day, I expect we will be able to explain many individual differences in behavior from looking at neuronal structure, but we are not there yet. We still know more about the “average” than any individual.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the most part, the answer would have to be 'not very much.' If variance was considerably higher, we would not be able to reliably use fMRI, EEG, MEG or anything localising brain function at all because such localisation is done by comparing activation patterns between different brains.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Here's a more technical answer, though:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Put very simply, the way we localise functionality across the brain is by measuring certain parameters (electricity, magnetism, blood-oxygen saturation, etc.) of brain activity in certain situations across a wide array of participants. Comparing these data, then, may or may not show significant trends that may indicate functional localisation of whatever we are researching. Therefore, the techniques used to gather these data are critical to our measurements and, in turn, the more spatial resolution our techniques offer, the more precisely we can localise functionality.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Let's look at one such technique to illustrate this a little more: EEG (electroencephalography) (<a href="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/515ba920e4b0afec12175c59/1529555987894-ZQWK35Q8UFWO4NH2HBSC/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kPFbgQaI4DtzUQSrpR4hMlZZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PIVWRg0YX5yWwn0SYlPlAlCyyn3p97oZq6nA7oRcrYHJMKMshLAGzx4R3EDFOm1kBS/EEG.JPG?format=1000w" target="_blank">illustration</a>). Generally speaking, EEG is considered to have poor 'spatial resolution' (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231201005689" target="_blank">source</a>). This is a means of saying that using only 19 (old standard) to 70 (new-ish high-density standard) electrodes to measure electric signals (i.e. currents within neurons), given the brain's complexity, may not necessarily allow for precise local measurements of these signals. See this illustration of <a href="https://www.bci2000.org/mediawiki/index.php/File:ElectrodePositions1020.PNG" target="_blank">electrode positions</a>. Although this problem can be rectified using certain algorithms and transformations (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4548479/" target="_blank">source</a>), there's simply a very real physical problem where, basically, you can fit only so many electrodes on a person's scalp (or, as is the case with invasive EEG, intracranially, i.e. placing electrodes under the skull). </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, modern hdEEG can achieve optimal spatial resolution at 2-3cm (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11336885" target="_blank">source</a>). Now that does leave some leeway for variance, but keep in mind that EEG is considered to have poor spatial resolution.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In contrast, consider BOLD fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging, much higher spatial resolution) where blood-oxygen saturation is measured and summarised in voxels (basically, individual pixels compiled from the data) that, typically, represent an area in the range of 1-5mm (<a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/functional-magnetic-resonance-imaging-9780878936274" target="_blank">source</a>). MEG plays in a similar ballpark (for a comparison of common techniques, <a href="http://web.mit.edu/kitmitmeg/MEG_Work_5.jpg" target="_blank">see this graphic</a>). Measurements are typically consistent across fMRI, MEG and EEG. This could not be the case if functional specialisation varied by a lot. In fact, by the very nature of how we measure functional localisation (again, by comparing lots of different brains), such variance cannot be very significant.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As for the size of specific areas, there can be some significant differences actually. For example, handedness may be correlated with morphology of the right putamen and left globus pallidus (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5516604/" target="_blank">source</a>), major depressive disorder has been linked to shrinkage of the hippocampus (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3733566/" target="_blank">source</a>) and decreased white matter integrity across many different areas of the brain (<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/white-matter-abnormalities-and-illness-severity-in-major-depressive-disorder/D133898E1AC298A5ED19699C1AE381D6" target="_blank">source</a>), Alzheimer's seems to be correlated with a decline in volume of many cortical and sub-cortical structures (<a href="http://www.ajnr.org/content/22/9/1680" target="_blank">source</a>) and so on and so forth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
