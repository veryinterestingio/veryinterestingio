		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cold water is good. Freezing ice cold water or actual ice is bad. You've damaged the nerves already- ice water or cubes will just damage it more since it will restrict blood flow and possibly cause damage itself. </p>
<p>Best thing for a burn is cool running water for 10minutes. </p>
<p>For an opposite view- have you ever had your hands so absolutely freezing cold that when you put them in what should be cold water, it feels warm? And actual warm or hot water is so hot it stings? You need to gradually warm your hands up under room temp water before you can turn it higher. </p>
<p>Your cells need time to react to the change in temp. The burn has actually heated up your cells and will continue to burn and cause damage. You need to cool it off, but not shock your system. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't find it online, but I checked a book out of the library that was just all about cold, and its applications. My recollection was that it doesn't matter what temperature water you use as long as its colder than the skin, it's mainly to soothe your damaged nerves and colder water won't produce blisters any more than warmer water. The only problem arises if you are using freezing water that'll burn the area further.</p>

If you don't believe me, do a test by burning both your hands at the same time and only put one under the tap.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Try to do it with cold but not so cold water (luke warm? not a native speaker), you last much longer. Which is better!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
