		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While I can't provide a very thorough answer, I can share some thoughts that were once shared with me when I was trying to understand modern art. I'll caveat this by saying pieces such as the ones you posted are still lost on me, but I have at least learned to just accept it as &quot;this type of art isn't for me&quot; rather than my previous mindset of &quot;this is just low-effort garbage&quot;.</p>
<p>For starters, try to see modern minimalist/abstract art as something born out of <em>generations</em> of other pieces slowly chipping away at the idea that everything needed to be painted/portrayed out in precise, incredible, vibrant detail. It's easy for us to look at Renaissance paintings with their ultra dense imagery and think &quot;this is truly peak art&quot;, but there's nothing really set in stone saying art has to be detailed to be good. In ways, taking away details can enhance the piece - think of black and white photography. By taking away the bright vivid colors, your mind is able to focus on other aspects that the color may have otherwise outshined.</p>
<p>So if you can take away color to enhance a piece of art, in the sense that the gap left behind is filled by the beholder's eye, what else can you take away? Shape, definition, clarity, realism, all things that artists throughout the years have experimented with. Most revolutionary pieces in the art world are held so high because they were the first to try it. It's easy to go &quot;well that's stupid, I could do that&quot;. But did you? Would the idea have even crossed your mind to try it? No. That's the quality that gives these kinds of pieces their significance to those in the art world.</p>
<p>So, going back to the pieces in the OP - again, the charm is lost on me. But try to keep in mind that art being highly regarded isn't always about people being entranced by it, or having some breakthrough emotional experience. Sometimes it's just that one piece made enough people stop and go &quot;huh... interesting&quot; that it becomes famous for it. What helped me understand it best was comparing it to the science behind evolution. We didn't become humans because one day an ape gave birth to a human. Years and years passed with small, but important, influential changes working at random to get us here. So too did art.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modern art is very similar to internet memes: Sometimes a meme is funny because of all the other memes it builds upon/satirizes. A person unfamiliar with all the &quot;history&quot; of that meme and the references just won't get it. </p>
<p>One good (early) example for an &quot;artistic shitpost&quot; is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_(Duchamp)" target="_blank">Fountain, by Marcel Duchamp</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In simple terms, art reflects current tastes. The examples you show are minimalist, which is a style that lots of people connect to. It is vastly different than the complexity and richness of Renaissance art styles.</p>
<p>Think about clothes as an example. 300 years ago, aristocrats used to wear elaborate outfits, but now everyone is wearing more or less the same type of clothes (the cost and quality are reflected through brands). No one today would want to wear those huge dresses, puffy collars, and tights. For a Renaissance person, today's outfits would seem unimaginative and plain.</p>
<p>Also, while some modern art seems simple, it builds up on other works within the genre. So people, who are unfamiliar with modern art, miss out on important milestones within the movement. It's like skipping chapters in a book and then saying that the book is not good. Sometimes you need deeper understanding of the art style to appreciate it in its entirety.</p>
<p>One of my favourite abstract artists is <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wassily_Kandinsky" target="_blank">Wassily Kandinsky</a>. I like his use of colours and shapes to create interesting compositions. Im assuming that people who appreciate the beauty in black roller streaks appreciate the composition and contrast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So... it’s gotta depend on the modern art curator in the museum.  I’ve seen shows of post-2000 art in museums all over the US that were incredible— interactive sculpture, mixed media, even things that used AI.   They changed your sense of the world you’re in, made you see things differently, helped you better understand societal issues and feel empathy for vulnerable groups.   Or were just absolutely beautiful and fascinating in ways you’d never considered before.  Miami, New York, DC, Chicago, Columbus (the Wexner center is awesome), Indianapolis (their art gardens).   Plenty of modern art is amazing... but I don’t know if those pieces are in the Louvre.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many highly valued modern art pieces with color theory (Mondrian, Rothko), technique (Frankenthaler, Krasner, Pollack), material/media (Höch, Duchamp), or other processes in art. </p>
<p>Many of these artists were also contributing to intellectual conversations about the role of art in society and in high education. </p>
<p>Some artists felt that the art world had become too closely tied to money-making and that professors and art experts were too separate from real social concerns. So they used modern/abstract art to challenge ideas about what has beauty, value, etc. </p>
<p>Of course, art is created in the real world also and the real world informs what artists do. After World War II, the Soviet Union championed “Soviet realism” or art the depicts real people and places. The United States government is therefore therefore invested heavily in abstract art and toured it around Europe as a counter to Soviet cultural efforts. </p>
<p>This is a very simple version of this story but the idea is that many modern artists disliked authoritarian government (Stalin) while the US government and conservative elite were opposed to the Soviets, and so about uneasy alliance was created. </p>
<p>Finally, some of the success of this art is that it was simply novel and yet somehow has beauty, at least to some people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
