		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The elevated heart rate during exercise is not inherently what makes it good, although it is a good indicator of how hard you’re working. There’s a bunch of other things going on at the same time; your lungs are working in unison with your heart to deliver oxygenated blood throughout your body. Moving is what an elevated heart rate is for.</p>
<p>The elevation in heart rate you’re experiencing while rolling on the couch after a few caps of quality MDMA is essentially increasing your resting heart rate. Your heart is working harder and pumping blood around your body (increasing your blood pressure), but you’re not moving in the way that you should be to increase your heart rate to this level.</p>
<p>Maybe you’re dancing at a club, and now both your heart rate and your blood pressure are higher than they should be for the movement that you’re doing.</p>
<p>In fit individuals this is probably not a huge issue (although high doses are a different story, as well as consistent use), but someone who is not physically fit could experience issues if they already have blood pressure problems. This can also be true for unfit individuals exercising too hard, too often and too soon.</p>
<p>Your body is a complex system of moving parts, and modifying one factor does not create a healthy whole.</p>
<p>Edit: I’m not a medical professional, so don’t take this comment as gospel. This is just my high-level understanding of the topic. It’s more practical experience in both areas (physical fitness and drug consumption) rather than formal education.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During exercise: your heart rate goes up to meet an increased need for oxygen. your heart pumps more blood so your muscles and brain get the oxygen they need to do the extra work.  1. Blood vessels in your muscles relax and accommodate this higher flow so the blood pressure isn't high. </p>
<p>2.The temporary increased heart is just a reflex from your working out, when you heart gets tired from the work it will slow down and you'll start feeling fatigued you will just stop and no problem</p>
<ol>
<li>the main benefit comes from the actual effect of moving your muscles and improving your circulation and other things irrelevant to this ELI5</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>When you snort le cocaine: it directly acts on your heart to make it beat faster (along with other fun effects) but the problem is there is no need driving that high heart rate. so just a few problems with that are: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The blood vessels in your muscles ( and other areas) aren't relaxing and accommodating this high flow so the pressure in your system goes up. they actually constrict !! cocaine makes your vessels tighter so the pressure goes up even more !! this high pressure can pop small vessels in your brain and give you a stroke ! </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you're no longer the one causing the increase in heart rate, it's the drug, when you heart starts getting tired and it wants to rest. IT CANT !! Le Cocaine is going to make it keep going This is why you can get a heart attack when on cocaine because your heart can't get itself enough blood to keep up with the work its doing :( </p>
</li>
<li>you aren't exercising so the actual benefits from the exercise movement aren't really happening.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The easiest answer is that exercise does indeed promote longevity, but not because of the increase in heart rate. Additionally, drug use is associated with earlier death, but also not mainly because of the increase in heart rate.</p>
<p>You found a common thing between the two, but that's just it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
