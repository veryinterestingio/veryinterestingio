		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A definitive conclusion has not yet been reached on the matter, but several theories have been proposed, which typically fall into two categories: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Kissing is an evolved trait. These theories are supported by kissing-like behaviours observed in many mammals, including other primates, which scientists have usually attributed to having grooming purposes. The most common thought on the specific behaviour kissing evolved from is premastication (not to be confused with premasturbation), which is when one animal chews food and then transfers it to the mouth of another animal, usually parent to child. Another theory in the evolutionary vein is that kissing lets us check the quality of our potential mates' saliva, but frankly I think that's ridiculous. When was the last time you heard anyone say &quot;Well I knew from tasting his saliva that he must have had dysentery&quot;?</p>
</li>
<li>Kissing is a learned behaviour. This theory usually either posits that kissing appeared within many different cultures simultaneously early in human history (at least before 3500BC, which is the earliest recorded evidence of a kiss taking place), or that one of the earliest groups of humans invented the cultural trait, which stuck with us through every single human population and migration since then. </li>
</ol>
<p>Both theories have holes they can't answer, which is why we don't have a consensus on it yet. We may never figure it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I like the theory that our lips and mouth are sensitive simply due to evolutionary necessity (to stop you from burning or otherwise damaging your mouth) and touching any sensitive area is pleasurable so we just figured that out at some point and there's no further deeper meaning behind it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone has a unique immune system. </p>
<p>When kissing, your brain is learning what the other person’s immune system is like. Ideally, you want someone who has a different immune system than you, because your progeny will have a wider immunological coverage. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/birth-control-pills-affect-womens-taste/" target="_blank">There’s some study</a> into women’s preferences for men changing depending on whether or not they are on birth control. The essential argument is that women’s brains want genetically diverse men to father their children, but genetically similar men to raise them. Because the pill forces a woman’s body to perpetually think it’s pregnant, this can lead to a shift in preference after she’s off it.</p>
<p>TL;DR</p>
<p>Kissing is you testing your mate’s immune system for the survival of your potential future spawn. Snog accordingly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Originally tongue kissing was a way to pass chewed food from parent to infant</p>
<p>And it still happens today in some cultures. </p>
<p>It evolved to be great way to show intimacy. </p>
<p>Better foods (and cooking techniques) came along meaning we didn’t have to chew our children’s foods. </p>
<p>The feeling of intimacy remained and more and more came to have a romantic connotation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
