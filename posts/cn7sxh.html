		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A pretty common method is to use magnetoresistance. Some materials change their electrical resistance depending on the direction of the magnetic field they're exposed to. So they put little slivers of those materials on a chip, at specific angles, along with circuitry to put a specific amount of current or voltage through the materials, and measure the how well electricity flows through them. Once they know that, the chip does the math to determine the precise 3D angle the magnetic field is pointing. The phone's CPU asks the chip for the compass data several times a second and averages it out to give you a smooth reading.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no magnet in the cell phone, there is a chip.<br />
The chip has a sensor that alters its resistance proportional to the Earth's magnetic field in a particular direction.  Circuitry on the chip detects the magnetic field strength and makes the field and its direction available as digital data.  The CPU on the phone pulls this data whenever compass data is required. </p>
<p>So when your compass app is running, it asks the chip to convert its reading of the earth's magnetic field into data that it then shares with you, the user.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people here get it only partially right. Of course, the compass needs a magnetometer to get the compass heading but that's not all. Phones that have gyroscopes (usually mid-tier to flagship) tend to get much more responsive and more accurate compass reading, because the phone software integrates readings from magnetometer, gyroscopes and even accelerometers to get a much more accurate compass reading. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter" target="_blank">Kalman filter</a> is commonly used for the integration. That's needed because magnetometer is very slow to update its heading and with high latency, but gyroscopes and accelerometers update hundreds of times per second with extremely low latency, so putting these signals together make the magic happen.</p>
<p>Well, I know this because I make apps and games that use these sensors to allow 360-deg gyro rotation, so that users wouldn't need to use their right thumb on touchscreen/joystick to look around. For low-end phones without gyro, users will experience laggy 360-deg rotation and the horizon tilts left/right like on a ship in a storm. That's the inherent issue with any magnetometer.</p>
<p>Now we have AR apps and games that integrate even more data from A-GPS and camera to track the phone rotation and position. Most app/game developers don't really integrate these math themselves, because iOS and Android already integrate for them, thanks goodness. Devs would go insane if they had to mess around with Kalman math.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
