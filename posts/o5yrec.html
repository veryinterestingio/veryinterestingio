		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few issues. The biggest one is that HIV mutates quickly, and there are many different strains of the virus circulating. Influenza vaccines are hard to get right due to viral variation, and HIV is even worse.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.590780/full" target="_blank">This paper</a> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the years, the greatest challenge in developing an effective HIV vaccine has been the high rate of mutation and recombination during viral replication</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, HIV infects immune cells, so increasing the immune system's activity might actually make things worse if you don't do it right. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2234358/" target="_blank">One HIV vaccine trial</a> actually made some people <strong>more</strong> likely to become infected.</p>
<p>Finally, the human immune system isn't great at fighting HIV. Even in natural infection, not everyone produces sufficient levels of neutralizing antibodies (which are antibodies that can stop the virus from entering cells, rather than merely binding to the virus). The immune response to a natural HIV infection is often weak enough to allow superinfection, which is when the person becomes infected with a second strain of HIV as well. </p>
<p>For all these reasons, HIV is a difficult target for vaccines. It's not impossible though, and maybe someday we'll have one.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From my understanding of it an HIV vaccine is difficult because:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>HIV targets immune cells so a vaccine would need a very strong initial immune response to clear the virus before it can become latent (which leads into 2)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HIV is a retrovirus so it inserts its genome into your DNA. Some of your cells will then carry the HIV genome even if no HIV virus is present. These cells need to die in order to get rid of the virus but the mechanisms for cell death may not be triggered once its embedded in your DNA. So your immune system needs to destroy the virus before it can become latent and hide in your genome where your immune system will never find it. This is also why HIV treatments arenâ€™t cures, they reduce the virus to undetectable levels but its always there.</p>
</li>
<li>HIV mutates quickly and its basically been a pandemic for 40 years allowing for a wide range of variation</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding to other comments: One of the biggest challenges is the latent reservoir.  HIV it can lie dormant in your cells, so drugs and your immune system don't know what to target.  Then after years of lying dormant it can begin to create more virus.  Antiretroviral therapy can target the cells that are producing virus but not the cells that aren't producing virus, and the half life of the viral reservoir is very long in people undergoing ART.</p>
<p>There have been proposals to try to treat the virus by forcing your cells to produce more of the virus so that infected cells can be more easily targeted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
