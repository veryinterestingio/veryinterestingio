		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, there are large reservoirs of flu in bird and swine populations. It’s probably more helpful to think of “flus” not “flu”. Being vaccinated against one or a few doesn’t do much if you get exposed to a different strain. Each year health authorities try and predict which strains will be the major ones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The 'flu' has a number of variants that infect species besides humans (swine and avian flus come to mind). Also flu viruses mutate a bit so human flu vaccines are tweaked most years to better combat that year's flu. </p>
<p>Because there are other hosts and new varieties, we probably won't be able to eliminate the flu totally with current vaccines and safety precautions like masks. We may be able to limit its spread and impact symptom-wise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The flu has non-human hosts so it would be very hard to eliminate even if all humans wore masks and got vaccinated. It only takes a small proportion of people who don't vaccinate or can't get vaccinated and it spreads quickly. It jumps from the non-human host to humans all the time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I understand correctly, the way we experience disease today is a function of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4481042/" target="_blank">urbanization</a> and <a href="https://www.hsi.org/news-media/animal-agriculture-could-spark-next-pandemic/" target="_blank">commercial agriculture</a>. Dense populations of humans necessitating massive, tightly packed commercial livestock operations creating optimal conditions for the evolution and spread of pandemic disease. As I understand it, this is one of the reasons European disease swept through the Americas in the way that it did, though I can't find a concise source for that at the moment.</p>
<p>Without addressing those factors changes in vaccination and masking practices won't make much of a difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>... You imply that every single person is actually intelligent and has actual common sense enough to wear a mask AND get the vaccination.<br />
If the COVID outbreak has anything to say about that, then such an implication is an abhorrently foolish one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
