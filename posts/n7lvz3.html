<p>On average, women have different foot shapes that aren't just scaled down versions of men's feet (or vice versa). Running shoe companies tailor around the 'average' man or woman's foot, which follows these measurements because you want a better fit whenever possible. A man could wear a woman's shoe and vice versa, but it might not be proportionately correct.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I’d presume, like with hands, that women’s feet tend to be less wide.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Fun fact: before the internet revolution there were a lot of paper catalogue sales. Well one store in, if I recall correctly, San Fransisco, began getting a lot of orders for women's shoes. This specialty store sold clothes for men who wore women's clothes. Somehow their reputation grew and women with large feet discovered the store and their fame was assured.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Men and women are shaped differently. One of the ones I remember is hip width. </p>
<p>From hip to heel the leg makes an angle with the ground. Because women have wider hips they make a greater angle and their shoes have to compensate for that. </p>
<p>A quick search led me to &quot;Q angle.&quot; I think that's what they talked about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Men and women are structured differently. If you ever look at ski and snowboard boots, you'll notice women's boots look like they have a bit taken out of the back. It's because a  women's calf goes further down the leg than a mans and having that bit missing makes the boot fit better.</p>
<p>This applies to gloves, too. Men's index and ring finger are the same size. Women's ring fingers are shorter than their index finger. So there is a point, if you'll forgive the pun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
