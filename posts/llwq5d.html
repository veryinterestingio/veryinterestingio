<p>You can wear a pair of glasses that flip your vision upside down and after a few days your brain will correct it to right side up. </p>

<p>&quot;After 10 days, he had grown so accustomed to the invariably upside-down world that, paradoxically and happily, everything seemed to him normal, rightside-up. Kohler could do everyday activities in public perfectly well: walk along a crowded sidewalk, even ride a bicycle. Passersby on the street did ogle the man, though, because his eyewear looked, from the outside, unfashionable.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our brains try to filter out uninportant information all the time. This is part of why if we use a product all the time, we can have no clue what we use. </p>
<p>If you need something not normally important (for example, to track your breathing), you can focus on it and your brain will filter it in until it decides it's unimportant again.</p>
<p>Your nose is not usually important to your concious mind, so your concious mind doesn't usually get it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your senses generate a TON of incoming information. More than your brain has the resources to process. Your brain is constantly receiving:</p>
<ul>
<li>HD visual from both eyes.</li>
<li>audio from both ears</li>
<li>touch pressure info from every nerve ending over your whole body</li>
<li>temperature info from other nerve endings all over your bodu</li>
<li>smell info from thousands of scent receptors in your nose</li>
<li>taste info from thousands of tastebuds</li>
<li>Other information on the position of your limbs, hunger levels, etc</li>
</ul>
<p>You physically can't process all this information constantly. It's not worth it because at any given moment most of it is useless. But the portion that's important changes depending on what you're doing.</p>
<p>So the brain has a filter, before the level of conscious awareness, where it decides what small slice of incoming info to send up the chain to be fully processed into awareness. The rest is discarded. </p>
<p>The key is, your conscious mind can control this filter! If you decide you <em>want</em> to see your nose, the filter says &quot;OK here's the visual&quot;. But the default setting is &quot;constant nose = unimportant = discard&quot;. Other things processed in a similar way is the feeling of your own clothes on your body or the taste of your own mouth. Constant repeated stimuli are ignored. &quot;pants...pants...pants&quot; is a waste of resources.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
