The point of intersection then has a massive increase in energy, and this the tumor can be affected.</p>
<p>I know a neurosurgeon and will come back to this with her response regarding the ultrasound procedure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. There is often a combination of two effects: the shape of the transducer and electronic steering. </p>
<p>Shape: imagine that each part of the transducer is a point source of ultrasound. Then, each element generates a spherical wave of sound. If two elements are equally far from a target, then the sound will reach the target at the same time and overlap. </p>
<p>Then, forming a sphere of sound elements around the area of interest will cause sound waves to reach the center of the sphere at the same time, so that spot is much louder than everywhere else. </p>
<p>Electronic steering: You can fake the position of point elements by making them generate sound a little bit before or after the other elements- if you delay the element it seems further away. Go early and that element seems closer. You can use this to pretend to have a sphere/hemispheric shape.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The tissue above is spared because the heat deposition drops off with the square of pressure, so because the beam is focused (explained in other comments) you can have a reasonably sharp boundary between destroyed and unharmed tissue. This boundary is blurred and less predictable with significant abherration (variability in sound speed along different paths to the focus) and is one of the primary technical challenges when doing high intensity therapuetic ultrasound (HITU).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not the exact same technique but <a href="https://i.imgur.com/MBrE8yZ.jpg" target="_blank">this image can explain the concept very well</a>. The timing and phase offset is such that only at the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ntqopyJ.jpg" target="_blank">exact site of operation called the focus point</a> the waves provide the constructive interference to project their combined energetic properties to alter tissue. All the other sites only experience the effects of a single waveform, which is not energetic enough to provide effect.</p>
<p>In easier terms think of it like holding a lens in front of a piece of paper in bright sunlight. Bring the paper too close and nothing happens because the paper is out of focus and neither will anything happen if the paper is far away. Bring it to the focus point where the sunlight becomes just a tiny dot and it will burn very quickly because all the energy is focussed on just a tiny point. The energy density is the key here. Using precision instruments that focus point can become tiny and be placed into a three dimensional position to perform non-invasive surgery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Side note:  </p>
<p>Another technique, that I don't see mentioned here, is where toxins (i.e. chemo therapy) are encapsulated and let loose in the blood stream and the ultrasonic beam is used to break the capsules in the correct area.  </p>
<p>The same techniques of beam forming are used to focus the ultrasonic energy on the correct area. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
