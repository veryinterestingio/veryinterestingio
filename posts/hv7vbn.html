		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lightning creates thunder by super heating the air it passes through, which expands rapidly. If you're close to it, it's one sharp CRACK.</p>
<p>When it's further away, though, it usually can't travel directly to you. It bounces off surfaces, echos, and comes to you through multiple routes. That spreads the sound out, so you are hearing the one crack many times.</p>
<p>The same thing happens with a gunshot. Nearby its louder but also more distinct. Further away quieter and more rumbly and spread out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cloud-to-cloud lightening can cross many miles, and happen within a fraction of a second. For example, the lightning starts 1 mile away, and ends 5 miles away. </p>
<p>The sound waves from such a strike won't hit you all at once because sound takes time to travel and reach you. The nearest part, 1 mile away would hit you after about 5 seconds, and the sound from the furthest part away will reach you after about 25 seconds.</p>
<p>Even though it's only one instance of thunder and it occurs almost instantly, the sound waves from the length of the arc will be continuously reaching you in between the 5 and 25 second mark. The thunder in this example would rumble for 20 seconds, because there would be a 20 second gap between when the first sound wave reaches you, and when the last one does.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alternatively: A wrestling move made famous by Rob Van Dam (RVD).</p>
<p>One of RVDâ€™s signature moves is the Rolling Thunder.  While his opponent is down on the mat, he starts on one side of the ring and rolls toward his foe. He then springs to his feet and flips onto his opponent, landing on his back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact about rolling thunder. A typical thunder is, obviously, loudest when you first hear it, and then the volume dies down. With a rolling thunder it sometimes (rarely) happens that the landscape is shaped a little like a satellite dish -- think small hills or formations of buildings -- which can make you hear the thunder building up to a crescendo first, and only then dying down. Essentially, what you get in a straight line is less than what you get from the sum of reflected sounds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

You also have to scream out &quot;ROLLING THUNDER&quot; for it to be 100% successful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
