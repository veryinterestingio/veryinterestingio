		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have heard of other people who moisturize so often that their skin no longer moisturizes itself enough on its own in the absence of moisturizer as it has become accustomed to the moisturizer's assistance. I am in a similar situation as I have used aquaphor (petrolatum) on my lips constantly for the past few years, and now I can't go much longer than a few hours without it lest my lips become chapped. It's almost as if my lips are more prone to becoming chapped ever since I started constantly moisturizing/protecting them. Why does this happen?</p></div></div>

<p>Wetting then drying your skin is bad enough for the oils in it without the flow and heat.</p>
<p>That being said, I'll take smelling nice and having to spend 2 minutes moisturising over smelling like ass any day</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are products that introduce moisture into the skin, like water soaking into cloth, and products that help your skin retain water, like a wax on top of cloth.</p>
<p>Vaseline/aquphor/petroleum jelly doesn’t introduce moisture to your skin - it sits on top of your skin and helps preserve what is already there. So if your skin is dry, you’re just adding a greasy layer on top, and once it wears off, your skin feels dry again. You need to find an alternate product that actually sinks into your skin and adds moisture and use that before aquaphor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I have a 6-hour exam coming up where I won’t be able to bring my chapstick into the exam room so any tips on getting lips to re-learn how to stay moisturized would be great!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A long time ago, I had this problem. Not knowing any of the science then (and little now) I decided that I was better off kicking the habit. Once enough time passed without using anything on my lips, they grew healthier on their own. I've never let myself get back in the habit. I've read some things that help to understand some of the problems. For example, wax like that found in chapstick, is harmful even if it feels good. Burt's Bees lip balm thing is apparently a good thing to try instead. Personally I think there is more to the issue than saying bad things on your lips will harm your lips.</p>
<p>When you start regular running, your feet build up calluses which makes your feet able to take more exposure to pressure and friction.  The same thing happens to your hands as you work with tools like shovels or hammers. Calluses make them less susceptible to damage but it takes time to build them up, and the process of building them can be painful. In college I learned that the feet and hands have what is essentially a special extra layer of skin which I makes that possible. (If I remember that correctly.) Nonetheless I think many of our other bother parts work similarly, including our lips. If you shake hands with a man who has done years of hard work with his hands, you'll notice his hand is tough, maybe even rough, making his skin strong compared to something like my own where most of the work I've done for years has been with a keyboard. Now, maybe you want your lips to be soft, but maybe you also want to let them be tough enough to keep their own moisture without cracking or feeling sore. Personally, I recommend making the transition to needing zero added products, but if you don't want to do that, then at least switch from anything with wax in it to something more like a moisturizer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve refused to use chapstick all my life and I’ve actually never had a problem with chapped lips. Anecdotal evidence I know, but just pointing out my experience. Same thing with body lotion, never used it and don’t have a problem with dry skin. My gf is the complete opposite and her skin is always drying out and her lips always getting chapped lol</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
