		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A normal whistle gives a constant note which is something that the human brain will automatically ignore as just a background noise. Lots of things make constant notes in nature and most of them is unimportant. Most important or dangerous things makes changing sounds so we tend to focus more on sounds that change instead of the constant notes. Musicians will change the notes of their flutes by blowing through them differently and covering up holes in different patterns. They will sometimes add vibrato to make a sound more noticeable by vibrating their finger over a hole. Referees are not musicians and just wants a whistle which grabs the players attention without having to do anything fancy with it. So instead of a finger to vibrate over a hole they stuff a cork ball into the whistle which will swirl around in the turbulent air and cover up the hole in the whistle changing the sound. This gives the whistle its characteristic vibrato sound which grabs peoples attention. It is also possible to change the speed of the ball by changing how hard you blow into the whistle which is something that is easier to interpret then a change in volume or note.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't.  Newer whistles use harmonics to create the shrill sound.</p>
<p>In fact, a referee almost lost his life, since the pea was stuck in his whistle.  He then invented a new whistle that is in use today.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Only old whistles have peas (the cork ball, because it looks like a pea). It's job is to rattle around the air chamber to create variance in the sound of the whistle, because a human brain really HATES flat soundwaves, and will ignore them. Unfortunately the pea mutes the whistle slightly (because it's absorbing the sound waves, being made of a squishy material), and can swell when gotten wet with rain or saliva and get stuck inside the whistle, which makes it almost useless, and most referees work in the rain quite often.</p>
<p>Modern whistles don't have the pea, instead using multiple chambers to create harmonic resonances in the whistle to create a shrill, oscillating tone that is both louder than a pea whistle (because you're removing the mute) and more attention grabbing (because you can intentionally design the chambers to vibrate at the right frequencies).</p>
<p>The modern standard is the Fox40 classic, a three-chamber whistle used by both football and american football referees.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
