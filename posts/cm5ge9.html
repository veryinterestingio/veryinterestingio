		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;edible&quot; part in edible gold simply means that it was processed in a way that it can easily be chewed up and swallowed. In most cases it just means that a chunk of gold was beaten into a micrometer thin sheet, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_leaf" target="_blank">gold leaf</a>, which is used to decorate food items. However other than that it is just plain old gold that has not been treated in any other way chemically. Gold as a noble metal is pretty biologically inert, so that when you eat it the metal just basically passes through your system. In this sense the kind of &quot;edible&quot; gold coating a candy is is no different than the kind of gold in say a gold ring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A couple of other posters have already pointed out that pure gold is <em>relatively</em> biologically inert. It is, after all, used extensively in dental work, so people walk around bathing it in acidic saliva and scratching at it with pork chop bones, for literally decades without any appreciable metabolic consequences. </p>
<p>On the other hand, a small family of injectible, anti-inflammatory pharmaceuticals containing a fair amount of finely powdered gold are useful in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Given its chemical inertia, we really don't yet understand the means by which metallic gold reduces inflammation, but there is plenty of clinical evidence demonstrating its efficacy at doing so; go figure.</p>
<p>As far as gold entering the digestive tract, the key safety requirement is that flakes must be thin enough (and therefore soft enough) that any sharp points will crumple, rather than scratch (or worse, get <em>stuck</em> in) the intestinal wall, especially if one should happen to get trapped in a fold or pocket. For that reason, edible gold leaf tends to be just a few dozen atoms thick - for example, the flecks of gold leaf suspended in Danziger Goldwasser, a popular liqueur, are only about 1/10,000 of a millimetre, or just a hundred angstroms. Fortunately, it's pretty easy to pound gold extremely thin without shattering it into a million tiny crumbs; that's kind of gold's &quot;party trick&quot;. But just try pounding <em>tin</em> that thin, and see what happens.</p>
<p>Many years ago, when I was a theatrical prop builder, I once had a designer insist that an important prop (hint: the opera was <em>named</em> after it) be covered with real gold leaf, rather than the cheaper and more common &quot;dutch metal&quot;, a gilt-coloured alloy of copper and zinc. The authentic gold leaf the production manager ordered for me came in cigarette pack-sized sheets so thin, even a sigh would cause them to wrinkle, or worse to clump up into unusable, chewing gum-like wads. <em>Very</em> difficult to work with, but I learned to use my finest kolinski hair paintbrush and the most gentle of breaths to &quot;float&quot; the leaves onto the thin layer of glue with which I had painted the prop.</p>
<p>The crumple factor - or lack thereof - is also the key reason you really don't want to try those &quot;glitter caspules&quot; that make your poo sparkly. Once the gelatin capsule dissolves in your stomach, the sharp, thick and unforgiving corners of all those little squares of mylar just won't crumple like gold leaf does. They can get stuck in the lining's folds and irregularities, and all those sharp plasticky edges can act like little knives to severely irritate the intestine - sometimes even enough to require medical treatment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don’t. It’s just really thin and since it isn’t toxic there is no harm in ingesting it. It’s basically an expensive decoration which adds no flavour. </p>
<p>You also excrete it out so if you were super desperate you could get it back....</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you define edible as being ingestible without causing immediate harm to the human body, then gold is so inert that it is, in this sense, edible once it is made into a form that a person can swallow (thin pieces). </p>
<p>If you define edible as able to be processed by the body after ingestion for nutrition, then gold is not really edible. There is (I believe) nothing the body can do to the ingested gold, it just passes through the digestive system unabsorbed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don't need to make it edible: it already is. The same way you don't need to make salt edible, but if you ate 200 g of it you would die. Gold is not very toxic, because it doesn't easily react with anything. Usually the gold is made into very thin pieces so it doesn't go &quot;clink&quot; when you try to eat it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
