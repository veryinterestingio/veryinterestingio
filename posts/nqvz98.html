I was talking to someone who is not an anti Vax, but didn't want to take any covid vaccine because he said it was rushed. I explained him that it did follow a thorough blind test, and did not skip any important step. And I also explained that it was possible to make this fast because it was a priority to everyone and because we had many subjects who allowed the trials to run faster, which usually doesn't happen normally.
But then he questioned me about why were the vaccines not fully approved, by the FDA for example. I don't know the reason and I could not find an answer online.</p>
<p>Can someone explain me what exactly is missing or was skipped to get a full approval?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR -  FDA approval is designed on purpose to be a <em>slow ass process</em> to make sure a product is <strong>safe, pure, and potent.</strong> It's a process made hard on purpose. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, an emergency use authorization slims down the red tape while still requiring a proven safety and efficacy record. </p>
<p><strong>ETA:</strong> If normal FDA approval is like a 300-guest wedding event, then emergency use authorization is a small courthouse wedding six months in advance of the main event so that they can file joint taxes and one spouse can technically be on the other's health insurance and dental. </p>
<hr />
<p>Right now the FDA has cleared just three of many vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J) for use via Emergency Use Authroization (EUA). To get there, they had to go through three phases, and at each stage demonstrate both a) effectiveness and b) safety. </p>
<ul>
<li>Phase 1: given to a small number of healthy people to see if it's safe at various doses and prompts an immune response (if OK, move to 2)</li>
<li>Phase 2: given to hundreds of people, randomized and controlled, to see short term side effects and immune response at varying doses (if no major short term side effects, move to 3)</li>
<li>Phase 3: given to thousands of people to measure effectiveness and more safety information vs. a placebo</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>For an EUA to be issued for a vaccine, for which there is adequate manufacturing information to ensure quality and consistency, FDA must determine that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks of the vaccine.</p>
<p>From a safety perspective, FDA expects an <strong>EUA submission will include all safety data accumulated from phase 1 and 2 studies conducted with the vaccine, with an expectation that phase 3 data will include a median follow-up of at least 2-months</strong> (meaning that at least half of vaccine recipients in phase 3 clinical trials have at least 2 months of follow-up) after completion of the full vaccination regimen. In addition, FDA expects that an EUA request will include a phase 3 safety database of well over 3,000 vaccine recipients, representing a high proportion of participants enrolled in the phase 3 study, who have been followed for serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest for at least one month after completion of the full vaccination regimen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far only 3 have made it to EUA. <strong>That means we know it works, we know <em>for sure</em> it's safe in the short term, and we know it's manufactured correctly and consistently.</strong> You have a vaccine, you proved it works, and you proved it's safe - you can produce it while you go through the rest of the slow-on-purpose process.</p>
<p>Now to have full approval, and under normal circumstances, the vaccine makers have to get full approval through a <strong>Biologics License Application (BLA)</strong> submitted to the Food and Drug Administration. This is a 3-stage process.</p>
<p>The BLA application itself includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applicant information</li>
<li>Product/Manufacturing information</li>
<li>Pre-clinical studies</li>
<li>Clinical studies</li>
<li>Labeling</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They schedule a bioresearch monitoring inspection. FDA comes out to inspect the production process and facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then they file a Form FDA 356th which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A summary of information submitted as part of the application.</li>
<li>Information on the applicant submitting the biologics license application.</li>
<li>A preclinical data section.</li>
<li>A clinical data section that includes safety and efficacy data on the product.</li>
<li>Draft labeling of the product to be licensed.</li>
<li>Information on the manufacturing, chemistry, and controls of the product.</li>
<li>A data summary of validation of important processes and assays involved in the manufacture of the product.</li>
<li>A description of the facility where the product is manufactured.</li>
<li>Case report form tabulations on the manufacturerâ€™s clinical experience with the product.</li>
<li>Case report forms and serious event narratives.</li>
<li>An index.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then we wait for the FDA review. This can take as much time as it needs to take.</li>
</ol>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know it's not your main ask here, but in case it helps your discussions in the future you should know another reason the vaccine was developed so fast was because some people had already done work for the better part of a decade on an mRNA vaccine against the spike protein of MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, another coronavirus that had pandemic potential). By an incredible stroke of luck, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is pretty damn similar to the MERS spike protein, so they were able to essentially dust off their work and have a new vaccine in human trials in something crazy like 2 months.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Time; as more people are vaccinated and more people can be monitored for side effects, more data can be gathered, analyzed, and submitted to the FDA for full approval. Normally, the process of testing in all 3 phases and approval is done before full scale manufacturing begins. With Warp Speed, testing and manufacturing were done at the same time, with the government eating the cost of any vaccines manufactured that turned out not to make it through the three phases. With more data available to analyze, I believe all 3 US vaccines are being presented for approval in the near future. </p>

<p>So to my understanding, it's in the FDA's court. I found it very encouraging that both producers did submit for full approval and didn't just say &quot;good enough&quot; with the emergency use.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
