<p>It's a few things.</p>
<p>1) Your ear drum is actually tucked back there about 25mm, around two bends, so it's not like a straight shot (for most ears), giving it some protection.</p>
<p>2) The outer 1/3 of your ear canal is cartilage. It's porous and always producing wax. The wax is excreted and moves in a circular motion as it gravitates toward the outside of the ear. As it moves, it collects all the dust and dirt that goes into your ear and carries it out.</p>
<p>3) Eventually the wax makes its way to the opening of the ear canal and falls away or is washed away in the shower.</p>
<p>This is all to say that the primary reason not to use q-tips is that you think you're cleaning your ears, but you're actually pushing ear wax further back into your ear canal. If you push it back into thy bony portion, it gets stuck because it isn't being pushed out any longer. Do this enough and you'll get a big, hard, black accumulation of impacted ear wax which will hurt to get removed.</p>
<p>Also - your ear drum can get dirty. Bacteria, viruses, hairs, bugs, and all sorts of other things do end up around your ear drum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Well, you'd hook it up to a clean source of water and blow it out.</p>
<p>Your ear is a hose full of gunk. Your ear is also creating more wax every day. That wax is the &quot;clean source of water&quot; that slowly blows the gunk out of the hose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gravity. One of earwax's main purposes is to collect dead skin, dust, and other debris and carry it out of the ear canal. If you don't stick fingers/q-tips/etc in your ear, you'll intermittently notice little balls of wax falling out. If you DO regularly stick things in your ears, chances are you're impacting earwax against the walls of the ear canal which other earwax sticks to and the entire process gets thrown out of whack.</p>
<p>Lesson: Don't stick things in your ears.</p>
<p>Edit: a few people are posting their own anecdotes where their ears didnâ€™t explode when they inserted an object into their ears. By all means, please do your own research or better yet, ask your doctor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
