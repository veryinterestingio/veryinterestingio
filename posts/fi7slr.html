		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Genetic code is kind of like a game of telephone. Each iteration is still very similar to the one before it. We know it's not ancient because it's still very similar to the other viruses in its family. A virus that was trapped in permafrost for 10,000+ years wouldn't have enough similarities.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Genetically an older virus will be more different from recent viruses than a new mutation. So youâ€™d compare their DNA or RNA and the amount of similarity can tell you the degree of closeness between them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We know where it came from due to its similarity to a virus in existence in an animal, and given that it was caught early, we know it came from Wuhan, which is not near the poles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simply put, we've already had plenty of news a month or two ago that the virus was sourced from a wet market in Wuhan.</p>
<p>Wet markets themselves are basically mass butcher shops.  Animals aren't always kept in the most sanitary conditions, often kept in cages &amp; crates stacked on top of each other.  A sick animal at the top is likely spreading all kinds of nasties to animals below them.</p>
<p>The thing is, it's not entirely about the condition they keep animals at wet markets, or the variety of animals they keep there.  It's about having enough food to feed their population.  Without wet markets, China would probably roll back several decades, to a time when they were facing huge issues with famine &amp; starvation, simply because food would become scarce.</p>
<p>;;</p>
<p>As for permafrost strains, that just sounds like you've listened to a few too many conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>If a strain from thousands or millions of years ago popped up, it'd be relatively easy to sequence it's genome and see how little it has in common with other modern viruses &amp; bacteria.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
