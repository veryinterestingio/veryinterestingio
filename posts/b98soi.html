		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different types of pain/pains in different parts of the body will have different causes. </p>
<p>For instance, a random twinge of belly pain is mostly like caused by a gas bubble moving through and stretching the GI tract. There’s a type of chest pain (precordial catch) that feels like a single, sharp, stabbing pain when the person breathes in- this type of random pain is common but unexplained. Occasional shooting pains in the limbs can be from a pinched nerve. People can have random electrical-type head pains as a side effect of some medications (“brain zaps”, which can happen in SSRI withdrawal). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your system shares neural pathways. Think of your nervous system like a multi lane highway. Some lanes for pain some for emotion. When you are very stressed you have a lot of traffic on the emotional lanes, some of it will change lanes into the pain lanes and register as pain. This can be a quick stabbing pain in random locations or ongoing chronic signals of pain coming from unresolved protracted internal or external stressors. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body is not a machine. Have you ever woken up and can't move right away? It feels like you're paralyzed and a little scary too.  Don't panic, your brain has to send the right signals to areas of the body so that way you can move again. Same goes for phantom pains, your brain is miscalculating movement. Sometimes it could be blood pressure too. You need blood flow in order to feel, on a physiological level, (there are phantom psychological/neurological pain as well but that's another story). Improper blood flow can cause cramping and immobilize you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I went to the doctor because I was having random stabbing pains in my chest that lasted for a second then just disappeared.</p>
<p>The way my doctor explained it, she said that there are 2 layers of muscles over your lungs that slide over each other as you breathe in and out. Sometimes they catch on each other as you're  breathing, and then just pop back to normal. That's why it was at random times and barely lasted 1 second. </p>
<p>They weren't harmful, just a derp by your chest muscles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
