<p>You see how you (likely) didn't go through every single word I wrote? That's how it works. It numbs people to the scandals so they can't actually mentally digest what they're experiencing and, as a result, have no motivation to challenge the person actually committing the scandals. It's very abusive and <em>very</em> effective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The firehose of falsehood is putting out so much fake news (propaganda) that any real news is drowned out.</p>
<p>From <em>The Russian &quot;Firehose of Falsehood&quot; Propaganda Model:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Russian propaganda is produced in incredibly large volumes and is broadcast or otherwise distributed via a large number of channels. This propaganda includes text, video, audio, and still imagery propagated via the Internet, social media, satellite television, and traditional radio and television broadcasting. The producers and disseminators include a substantial force of paid Internet “trolls” who also often attack or undermine views or information that runs counter to Russian themes, doing so through online chat rooms, discussion forums, and comments sections on news and other websites. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reports that “there are thousands of fake accounts on Twitter, Facebook, LiveJournal, and vKontakte” maintained by Russian propagandists. According to a former paid Russian Internet troll, the trolls are on duty 24 hours a day, in 12-hour shifts, and each has a daily quota of 135 posted comments of at least 200 characters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Experimental research shows that, to achieve success in disseminating propaganda, the variety of sources matters:  </p>
<p>* Multiple sources are more persuasive than a single source, especially if those sources contain different arguments that point to the same conclusion.  </p>
<p>* Receiving the same or similar message from multiple sources is more persuasive.  </p>
<p>* People assume that information from multiple sources is likely to be based on different perspectives and is thus worth greater consideration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The experimental psychology literature tells us that first impressions are very resilient: An individual is more likely to accept the first information received on a topic and then favor this information when faced with conflicting messages. Furthermore, repetition leads to familiarity, and familiarity leads to acceptance:  </p>
<p>* Repeated exposure to a statement has been shown to increase its acceptance as true.  </p>
<p>* The “illusory truth effect” is well documented, whereby people rate statements as more truthful, valid, and believable when they have encountered those statements previously than when they are new statements.  </p>
<p>* When people are less interested in a topic, they are more likely to accept familiarity brought about by repetition as an indicator that the information (repeated to the point of familiarity) is correct.  </p>
<p>* Even with preposterous stories and urban legends, those who have heard them multiple times are more likely to believe that they are true.  </p>
<p>* If an individual is already familiar with an argument or claim (has seen it before, for example), they process it less carefully, often failing to discriminate weak arguments from strong arguments.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.ashford.zone/images/2017/09/The-insane-news-cycle-of-Trump-s-presidency-in-1-chart-Axios-1.png" target="_blank">Here’s a chart of the news cycle interest from a year in the Trump Admin</a></p>
<p>Almost every week there’s some major scandal, some outrage, but none of it really gains traction because within a few days there’s another scandal. Maybe the news can really dive into two scandals... but then there’s another one, and then another. Can’t cover them all, so drop coverage of the last one. Then there’s another scandal. Drop the oldest one. Then you’re five scandals in, and it feels like forever since the first one. But it’s only been two weeks. But the first one feels like it happened so long ago, so you’re numbed you it. Then there’s another scandal. And another. Then the first few are relegated to archived pages. They’re not newsworthy anymore, even though absent the rest of the scandals they would dominate the news for weeks, if not months. And on and on and on.</p>
<p>Then there’s too many to remember. People forget the earlier ones until reminded, but then there’s another new one. Each one only lasts a few days, because they’re constantly being shuffled out to make way for fresh content in the news, which the Admin is happy to supply.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It takes time and effort to produce an effective counter for progaganda. You have to analyze the text, critique it and produce the response.</p>
<p>The Firehose of Falsehood is a technique where you keep producing new propaganda faster than it can be debunked.</p>
<p>You introduce propaganda piece A on Monday, B on Tuesday, C on Wednesday, D on Thursday, E on Friday, etc. If it takes 2 days to produce a counter piece, the debunk for A will be produced when C will be the message being sold. This means that it won't be an effective counter for A because A isn't in the forefront anymore. It also won't do anything against B or C, nor will to combat D &amp; E when they are introduced.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
