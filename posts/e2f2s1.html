		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are (usually) based on the reaction of CO2 with a base to form a bicarbonate salt. Many different bases can be used for this. The Apollo program scrubbers used LiOH (due to light weight) but the CO2 absorption canisters couldn't be reused. For flights of a few days, this is fine. Famously, during Apollo 13 <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a13/a13_LIOH_Adapter.html" target="_blank">an adapter needed to be rigged up to use the command module CO2 scrubbers before the LiOH canisters in the lunar module ran out</a>.</p>
<p>The International Space Station, which is continuously inhabited, <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20050210002" target="_blank">uses a different method based on binding of CO2 to a zeolite</a>, which is a highly porous metal oxide (in this case, a mixed oxide of aluminum, magnesium, and silicon with pore size 5 Å). Although the zeolite has basic sites within its crystal structure, the extremely high surface area is probably more important than the basicity. Heating the zeolite releases CO2 into the vacuum of space.</p>
<p>Submarines <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0029801883900100" target="_blank">use monoethanolamine</a>, which is a liquid base. This can likewise be heated to reverse the reaction and regenerate the base. The released CO2 is put into the outside water. This means that submarines can operate for long periods of time without needing to replace the CO2 scrubbers. This technology is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanolamine#Gas_stream_scrubbing" target="_blank">also being pursued for scrubbing CO2 from power plant exhaust</a>.</p>
<p>There are a few other methods, such as passing the gas over a membrane selectively permeable to CO2 (which <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037673881400194X" target="_blank">only works well for high-pressure gas streams</a>), or by feeding CO2 to algae, but these generally aren't widely used.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just as an aside, there is another type of CO2 scrubber that actually removes VOCs from the gas prior to it being captured, etc, in industrial plants. Those work by pulling the CO2 upward through a column that contains a packing material, while water flows downward from the top. The water captures the VOCs in the process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We use carbon dioxide absorbers in anaesthesia to conserve oxygen and allow us to deliver oxygen at low flows. The absorbers are soda lime (NaOH) and Ca(OH)2.</p>
<p>CO2 + Ca(OH)2 -&gt; CaCO3 + H2O + heat</p>
<p>Essentially the CO2 reacts with the alkali. The soda lime canister also contains an indicator that turns pink when the soda lime is “exhausted”. We also know when this occurs because absorber efficiency decreases and the inspired fraction of carbon dioxide increases.</p>
<p>Edit: forgot to add that water is needed for the reaction to occur. This is obviously useful as we exhale warm,  humidified air. The soda lime also produces heat so there is reduced heat and water loss from the patient than if they were breathing non warmed, humidified air.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>CO2 forms carbonic acid when it dissolves into water. If the water has a strong base in it, the carbonic acid reacts with that to form a carbonate. For example, sodium hydroxide (lye) in water will react with CO2 to form sodium carbonate or even bicarbonate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This should cover it. Basically, CO2 dissolves better with a high pH solution. So you have air constantly flowing through a recirculated high pH liquid (usually NaOH and water), which reacts, lowering the pH of the liquid. A valve or metering pump maintains the pH in the scrubber high enough for the desired efficiency. All the while, CO2 is removed from the continuous flowing gas stream.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
