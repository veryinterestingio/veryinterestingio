<p>German and french knives are &quot;flat ground&quot; with a symmetrical double bevel edge, most japanese knives are &quot;chisel ground&quot; with a single bevel edge instead. <a href="http://rtscript.com/aura/The-Merits-Of-A-Blade-That-Is-Less-Than-Shaving-Sharp-not.jpg" target="_blank">Visual representation here.</a></p>
<p>Knife sellers claim that chisel ground knives can achieve sharper, thinner and stronger edges compared to flat ground knives and browsing forums that seems to be the general opinion.</p>
<p>Given the alloy used in the blade is constant, would you say the claim holds?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Asymmetric knives are particularly useful in applications for cutting thin slices.</p>
<p>It isn't that they're actually sharper. On an equal included angle basis, an asymmetric grind is not sharper than a symmetric ground knife.</p>
<p>When cutting thin slices, the pressure on the flanks of your edge is not symmetrical. The material on the thin slice side of the knife (I'll call it the freed material) peels away from the knife when it is cut. </p>
<p>Being thin, the freed material bends easily compared to the material on the opposite side which is backed by lots of uninterrupted material.</p>
<p>You will see asymmetrical blades in common thin cutting applications like chisels, carpentry planing blades, sushi knives. Basically all metal working and general machining applies asymmetric blades in that their rake angle &quot;attacks&quot; into the material while the relief side (trailing side) is nearly parallel to the material left behind. You rarely see symmetric cutting in spinning cutting tools because they cut thin chips.</p>
<p>If you use a symmetric knife while cutting thin cucumber slices, you'll find that the blade tends to steer out of your cut if you push your cut down the centerline of the blade. To achieve straight non steered cuts, you'll find that you have to angle the knife until the relief side of the edge is basically parallel to the material on the unfreed side. You will basically be cutting with a blade configuration like an asymmetric blade.</p>
<p>Getting more controllable cuts gives the general impression of sharpness even if the actual severing pressure is the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are absolutely sharper. It’s a steeper angle at the edge of the blade. </p>
<p>That said, they’re not for everything. You don’t always want the sharpest edge possible, as tougher things will dull them much faster. You usually see a single bevel used for chopping vegetables or sushi. </p>
<p>A standard bevel may not get as sharp, but will keep its edge longer when cutting tough things like meat and root vegetables. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The single or double bevel is a personal choice of the user, it’s the angle that indicates a sharper blade, and it’s the type of steel that allows for the thinner blade. German steels are very tough, and usually have a 30 degree blade. Japanese steels are typically harder, but less tough. That means they can be sharpened to a angle around 15 degrees, but are more prone to chipping, so they should never be used on frozen items or meat with bones in them. Many Japanese blades have a single bevel, because that’s often traditional (especially on sushi knives), but most of the kitchen knives you see in the store are double beveled. If you look at some of the fancy, $100+ knife sharpeners, they will often have two variants, one with a wider angle for German knives, and one with a narrower for Japanese. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think there are pros and cons, even is the angles are the same:</p>
<p>pro of single bevel: easier to cut if you cut thin: you only have to fold the thin part you cut off out of the way and don't have any pressure against what you are slicing away from.</p>
<p>con: single bevel is in fact harder to sharpen. When you sharpen just one side the edge will fold/roll over a bit and in the case of the single bevel you need to polish that away I think.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chisel ground does not inherently produce an edge that is any of those things. It all depends on the sharpening angle. Smaller angles cause knives to have better cutting ability (since they are a smaller wedge splitting the material you are cutting apart) and <a href="http://www.cliffstamp.com/knives/reviews/angle_experiments.html" target="_blank">better edge retention</a>, but lower edge durability (resistance to chipping or deformation). Sharpness is entirely independent of sharpening angle since it is the thickness of the knife apex.  If a knife is chisel ground to produce a smaller sharpening angle then those will be the results. You could achieve similar results with a regular grind if you lower the sharpening angle. Chisel ground knives will also cut asymmetrically, which may or may not be desired.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
