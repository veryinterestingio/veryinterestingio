Film actually has an incredible resolution - sometimes better than 4K - so as long as you have the original film you can go back and re-digitize the footage and get high resolution videos.</p>
<p>Video from the 90's was often recorded on magnetic tape - like a VCR - which had <em>terrible</em> resolution.  There is nothing we can do to go back and get high-res videos from that tape, because the source material isn't good enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, because a lot of the footage you're seeing from the 1970s that is still popular to watch today was shot on film. And not just any film but <em>good</em> film, such as 35mm or 70mm. Good film is expensive (purchase, processing, duplication, storage - everything about it is expensive), they also used good sound and lighting resources because it didn't make sense to use expensive film and cut all the other corners. All of this makes for an experience that has withstood the test of time. In other words, there's some selection bias at play.</p>
<p>But going back to the 60s (and maybe even the late 50s), various media used videotape and similar technologies for cheaper applications. For example, soap operas and game shows. If you search for those on youtube you'll see the much lower quality difference.</p>
<p>From: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiping" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiping</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though most soap operas made the transition from live broadcast to videotaping their shows during the 1960s, it was still common practice to wipe and reuse the tapes. This practice was due to the high cost of videotape at the time. While soap operas began routinely saving their episodes between 1976 and 1979, several soaps have saved recordings of most or all their episodes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the '70s early consumer and semi-pro video tape equipment came along (the film <em>Auto Focus</em> features early tech). It really took off in the 1980s alongside the miniaturization of electronics in general and started a new boom of homebrew/garage media production. </p>
<p>That's sort of what fed into what you perceived by the 1990s, and the aesthetic also matched the 80s/90s garage/grunge/punk/metal scenes back then. So while it was &quot;budget&quot; it was also cool. </p>
<p>With a few thousand dollars in equipment you could create a show &quot;good enough&quot; (highly subjective) for late night cable access channels, or something you could create, duplicate and ship relatively cheaply and independently on VHS or Beta. That was a big deal. To reach a wide audience back then was very different than today. You couldn't just upload to youtube some random thing you caught on your cellphone cam. You had to (at a minimum) deal with a studio of some sort, a distribution company, possibly censors and &quot;suits&quot;. </p>
<p>However, it was a massive leap forward compared from before that. If you wanted an &quot;indie&quot; audience you might have to pitch your little 16mm indie movie to the local theater owner, or enter it into a film competition or festival. Or sell it in the back pages of magazines. And anything &quot;mainstream&quot; generally had to go through all the layers of the big studios/distributors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To expand on the explanations about film vs. video:</p>
<p>It's not just cost, but mostly speed, ease of use and the overall cost of production.</p>
<p>Film wasn't <em>that</em> expensive, but you needed a shit ton of it for motion picture. Remember 35mm film? That's 36 pictures. For motion, film is shot vertically on half the frame, so on that 36-image roll, you'll get 72 frames - with 24 images per second, that's 3 SECONDS.</p>
<p>If you've ever watched a behind the scenes of some movie, you'd see cameras with those large bulky film canisters.</p>
<p>Not just that, but whenever you need to do several takes or a reshoot, that's film wasted.</p>
<p>Next, film needs to be developed. That requires people, dark rooms, chemistry... More costs and time as it always takes a few hours to days.</p>
<p>Shooting in different lightning conditions? Gotta take different film stocks and change them as needed, together with lenses or just about entire cameras because that's faster.</p>
<p>For a big budget movie watched at cinemas that's all worth it but for TV use that's crazy expensive. Remember TVs were like 12 to 15 inches at the time, with aerial antennas - the quality was ass anyway. So as soon as video became available, it was vastly preferred for TV work.</p>
<p>Also to do any sort of trickery with film, you either had to <em>physically</em> manipulate it, or transfer it to video anyway.</p>
<p>As an example, Star Trek TOS and TNG were shot, cut and edited all on film, so it was eventually possible to just rescan the film and release modern HD versions (TOS had some effects remade but the point remains). Voyager however, while also shot on film, had all effects made after transferred to video, and so for HD release those would have to all be remade from scratch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
