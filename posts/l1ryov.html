		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A little tidal history!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The earliest evidence for at least a practical understanding of the tides dates back to 2500-1500 BC in the form of a tidal dock at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathiawar" target="_blank">Kathiawar</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is evidence, of a controversial nature, for humanity's understanding of the relationship between the tides and the lunar cycle that dates back to at least 2000 BC through ancient megaliths in western Europe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It took a long time before any progress was made, some of the most important contributions were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gilbert_(physician)" target="_blank">William Gilbert</a> (1544-1603): proposed the tides were of a magnetic nature (he was responsible for the discovery of the Earth's magnetic  field)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei" target="_blank">Galileo Galilei</a> (1564-1642): proposed the tides were a direct result of accelerations due to orbital motion of the Earth around the Sun (largely he used this as evidence
for the Copernican model of the solar system) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler" target="_blank">Johannes Kepler</a> (1571-1630): actually made the correct prediction (based on documented observations), that some attractive force between the Earth and Moon was responsible, although it met with fierce resistance from Galileo </p>
</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes" target="_blank">Rene Descartes</a> (1596-1650): introduced a quite creative Theory of Vortices which was regarded as the correct answer for many decades (despite not only completely ignoring Kepler's laws but also making no reference to any previous tidal theory!).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was Newton's pioneering work in Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica that provided the correct description for the cause of the tides, which came as a consequence of his Universal Law of Gravitation (which Kepler was close to). However, Newton's ideas were not accepted over the Theory of Vortices until 1740 with the help of giants such as Daniel Bernoulli, Leonhard Euler, Colin Maclaurin, and others. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This (1940) is really when we actually knew, not before as other posters have suggested (it was hypothesised but the mechanism was not understood). The reason we did not know prior to this is because the cycle of the Moon did not universally explain observations which is why other theories were proposed. However, I would say Newton gets an unfair amount of credit for his discovery of the mechanism behind the tides, he actually did little work on tides. It is the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace" target="_blank">Pierre-Simon Laplace</a> (1776) that is the basis of modern tidal theory.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The tides tend to get stronger and weaker in about a two-week cycle, exactly half the cycle length of the Moon. You can follow that pattern over years or even decades, and it's always linked to the Moon. Full/new Moon: Large tides. Half moon: Small tides. Pretty obvious that they are connected somehow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For thousands of years people have thought that the moon caused the tides. </p>
<p>In 1608 Simon Stevin suggested it is because of gravitational attraction. Galileo Galilei did not believe this and mocked this idea.</p>
<p>Newton first calculated tidal force correctly, and used this to predict the hight of the tides as a function of latitude. His theory was very simple and assumed a planet covered in a uniform ocean without continents, where the height of the tides is in equilibrium. His height of the tides was several meters off.</p>
<p>In 1775, Laplace created a dynamic theory, taking into account the momentum of water, the Coriolis effect, the shape of the continents, et cetera. This proved a more accurate model.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
