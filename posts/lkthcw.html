<p>What I find confusing about that is that air conditioners are typically extremely power hungry and in use every summer. And most home heat is natural gas. Why can't Texas in particular deal with winter demand when it can handle summer air conditioning demand just fine?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m in Houston and currently without power. It has nothing to do with the customers. It’s all about our electrical grid generator sites going down due to sustained freezing temperatures. A large portion of our generation capacity was not properly winterized for that level of cold.</p>
<p>In Texas, especially on the south coast, we never see temperatures like this... not even close to this. These are record setting highs of 17F, when a typical February ranges from 38 to 68 (all above freezing). So, our power plants are designed for a temperature range above freezing. Literally, pipes at the plant are freezing up solid, shutting down the generators.</p>
<p>Also, on top of that, the supply of natural gas comes from Texas oil wells. Most oil wells rely on electricity to pump the wells. Without electricity, those pumps (rod pumps, electric submersible pumps, etc.) can’t run. Now the supply of gas to the power plants is slowing down. Now we have a viscous cycle starting.</p>
<p>So, as you can see, this isn’t an increased demand issue, it’s a lack of supply issue. In fact, heating units use less power than AC. Our demand today is still less than the hottest day in August.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our power systems aren’t well suited for the cold, in particular. Texas is experiencing the coldest consecutive days in a century, in large part. </p>
<p>Some folks here have natural gas heating and some have electric heating; both are common. We’re underdressed and cold, so demand for both electrical power and natural gas heat is very high... trying to support all those heaters working overtime, plus all the normal stuff. </p>
<p>Typically, a significantly large portion of our electrical power comes from natural gas.</p>
<p>Right now, a really big chunk of the natural gas supply is being used to support the enormous spike in demand for natural gas heat, leaving much less than what is sufficient to support the also very high demand for electrical power.</p>
<p>Icing on the power shortage cake:
Natural gas production is taking a big hit because of freeze-offs. Freeze-offs happen when temps drop low enough to freeze water and other liquids contained within the natural gas mixture, blocking the flow of gas out of the wellhead. </p>
<p>In the summer (and most of the year), we don’t need natural gas for heating, so all of that is available to support our electrical power demands (keeping those power hungry A/Cs running), and natural gas flows just fine in the warmer temps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>FWIW, even efficient electric furnaces use twice as much power as AC compressors, and furnaces tend to run longer than AC to maintain a certain comfort level (20 degrees of cooling vs 40 degrees of heating).</p>
<p>Edit: in the spirit of eli5, I substituted 'electric furnace' for 'whole-home heating system.'</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The further south you go the less gas heat you have. So they go to electric heat. Don't usually need as much heat further south. And when it's mild out 40s even 30s it's basically the same as using the ac. But when it drops below that the emergency heat kicks in. At that point they are basically heating their house with a giant toaster. Super energy inefficient. Electric heat on average uses 63 amps ish. Heat pump like 12 amps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I haven’t seen this story, but you may be wrong that all houses use gas heat. At least that is common in northern climates. But my guess is that in places where freezing temps are rare that electric heat is more prevalent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
