		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to manage the produce department of a major retail chain. The way it was explained to us by the pest control company, corporate cleanliness standards, and general word of mouth training is that the fruit fly eggs are already over all of the produce.  They get placed when the fruit is out in mother nature growing and there's no good way to get rid of them once they are laid, nor is there much of a reason to.</p>
<p>Once the fruit started to ripen it produces methane, which accelerates the ripening/rotting of the fruit.  This increase in methane triggers the fruit fly eggs to hatch, which in turn hastens the rotting even faster.  This is also why there is suddenly ALL THE FRUIT FLYS when there wasn't any before and why one bad apple WILL ruin the bunch much faster.</p>
<p>It's all part of mother nature/s elaborate dance.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You probably don't actually want to know the answer to this question, but you asked. They don't just appear from nowhere, the eggs are already on the fruit when you buy it. Which means you've likely eaten a lot of fly eggs. And larvae.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Given that they're incredibly small and make little to no audible noise, it's likely that you've unwittingly allowed at least a handful of them into your house just from going in and out throughout the day; either that or they managed to find a small point of entry somewhere in your house. Under normal circumstances when no rotting food is present, these scouts will fly around in search of food until they die, and since their numbers would be low in this scenario, you'd rarely ever notice them. But when ideal circumstances are present (especially dirty or clogged sinks), they'll fly to the new source of food and breed there until your house is overrun with them.</p>
<p>Bonus and not necessarily related to this ELI5: there's an easy homemade trap you can make that will kill them extremely efficiently. Pour a little apple cider vinegar (it needs to be this) into a tall glass cup and put a few drops of dish soap in it so that the surface tension of the cider is broken (otherwise they'll just float on it). Then make a cone out of some paper and widen it in such a way that the upper portion of the cone seals the cup without the bottom portion touching the vinegar itself. Tape the cone to make sure it doesn't come undone and put the trap on the counter for a few days. Any stragglers in the house will happily go into it and drown.</p>
<p>EDIT: Other users made me aware that it's also a possibility that fruit flies could have already laid eggs on fruit while it sat in the store, which is just all the more reason to rinse them properly before you eat them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
