		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes it is reverse engineering the game's code. Sometimes it is done by a password system (games that use a 'seed' or other indicator for rare drops may make it entirely possible to spawn a massive amount of said item quickly)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But often times it is brute force/chance. Even well playtested games have nowhere near the manpower that the playerbase will have. There may be a few dedicated people spending hours running into walls hoping to find a glitch that pushes them through, but for the most part it is more the result of thousands of players and someone coming across a bug.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With the thousands, and sometimes millions of people who play games, bugs are bound to be found. Some will be shared to the internet. </p>
<p>Other times there are those who deliberately try to find these exploits by just doing the most weird shit. Eventually they are bound to find something if they try long enough. People can also look at other games with similar engines and see what the exploits were and then try out those moves in the game they are currently playing. For example, bethesda titles are run on the same and in some cases very similar engines, so the bugs tend to be very similar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aside from what people have mentioned. It's worth noting there's still a sizeable amount of work that goes into refining glitches to be useful. There's tons of examples of glitches that people found accidentally but dismissed as random and useless that turned out to have cool uses to skip area or obtain items once properly researched and tested in different ways. So often the smooth end result looks nothing like what the initial discovery did. That takes a bunch of game knowledge and time to test things once glitches are found</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Exploiting video games isn't all that different from exploiting other types of software.  Generally, you try to do something unexpected, excessive, or just plain quickly, which causes the software to behave weirdly, then you keeping doing that action slightly differently, until you achieve the desired result.</p>
<p>It helps to understand how games (and software in general) work on a fundamental level. For example, collision detection is used to determine if two or more bodies are &quot;touching&quot; in the game world.  If you understand the various algorithms used to perform collision detection as well as the fact that numbers with decimal points have weird behavior on computers, then you'll realize some common &quot;tests&quot; you can perform in maps that may cause you to go through walls or something.  </p>
<p>Things like item duplication are mostly luck.  A developer made an assumption about items that the player ended up breaking.</p>
<p>For some games, you can hook up what's called a &quot;debugger&quot; to the game application and explore how the game was programmed.  You can then do things like stop the application and walk through execution line by line, inspecting how values in memory change as various actions are performed.  This is called a break point.</p>
<p>Generally, a hacker would do a bunch of crazy stuff in the game until they find a glitch, freeze, crash, slowdown, or maybe just an error message.  When that happens, they will fire up a debugger and attached it to the game.  They will then put break points in the application and various places and trigger glitch, freeze, crash, etc, stepping through the code to see what is causing the bug.  </p>
<p>Once they see what the bug is causing the crash, the hacker can then tailor their actions in such a way that they can trigger the bug, but instead of crashing, it will cause the program to do what they want.  </p>
<p>So in the example of item duplication, let's say the hacker is doing a bunch of weird stuff in the inventory screen, like dragging items where they shouldn't be, etc, until they find a glitch.  They then hook up the debugger and notice that oh hey, the code remembers the slot that I picked up an item from, and it blindly does a stackSize++; when the item is dropped somewhere it doesn't belong, then clear the item from the cursor.  But if they put the cursor over the avatar's head and release the mouse button, the stack size incrementing code triggers, but the clear item from cursor doesn't.  So that can be repeated to get infinite items.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Knowing how computers / software work, plus practice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes, other than reverse engineering the game's executable files, people can also reverse engineer the application protocol used by the game client and server to communicate over the internet.</p>
<p>What you do is eavesdrop on everything your computer and the game server are saying to each other. And if the game is poorly coded, you can see thing like the client saying to the server &quot;give me 1 more of this item&quot; and the server blindly agrees. You are then free to replay (resend) the same request over and over.</p>
<p>It's become very unlikely that games are coded like that nowadays but it's been seen in the past, I believe there was something pretty similar to this with Guild Wars a while back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
