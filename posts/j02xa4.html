		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of these answers are begging the question (repeating the question as if it is an answer). </p>
<p>Basically, people are just saying, &quot;we form bonds with our pets because we form bonds with our pets&quot; by saying &quot;because they are cute and bring us joy!&quot;</p>
<p>The actual answer is that most domesticated animals trigger our innate responses to tiny humans. The biological mechanisms in our brains that evolved to encourage us to protect and take care of babies and toddlers are triggered in the presence of certain cues, and over time we have selectively bred some animals to exhibit those cues for their entire lifetimes, and even moreso when they are a few weeks to a few months old.</p>
<p>Domestication is, in essense, breeding animals to remain in their infantile state.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We've been breeding our go-to pet species for thousands of years. Over time, pets that seemed cuter to us were bred more often, creating cuter and cuter generations of pets (amongst other, more useful characteristics)</p>
<p>After, let's say, fifty thousand years of breeding, you can imagine there are some pretty cute pets.</p>
<p>Couple that with the breeding of animals in the last 800 years or so with the exclusive goal of creating the cutest breeds possible, these days you're basically helpless against the powers of cuteness that some pets have over you. They're basically genetically engineered to be adorable.</p>
<p>Edit: I'll add that in modern times I believe our propensity to think animals as cute has probably increased, due to less pests and threats from other animals. So we may think a lion is cute because we're not very likely to be killed by one, or have it eat our cattle. But many farmers in Africa absolutely hate lions and frequently poison them. So we're likely conditioned to see more animals as cute if they're not a nuisance or threat to us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
