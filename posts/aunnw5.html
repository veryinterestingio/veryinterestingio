<p>Why donâ€™t you get half your vision obscured by the eyelid?</p></div></div>

In fact, right now you have a blindspot in your vision where all of the nerves come into your eye. But, you don't see it because your brain edits it out. There are tricks you can do to notice things disappearing into your blind spot but normally you can't see it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How often do you notice your blinks?   Almost never, unless you are specifically thinking about them.  However, if the lights went out for that long (almost a third of a second) or someone covered your eyes, you would totally notice it.  It's because your brain has evolved to pay attention to the important things and ignore the unimportant ones.  It knows that you are not going to get information when the eye is closed, so it just erases it from consciousness.  </p>
<p>It is the same with closing one eye.  It knows that you are not getting info from it, so it just doesn't pay attention.   Compare your visual experience with having one eye closed versus having one eye mostly covered up.  They are significantly different because the internal system that pays attention to inputs gets turned off when you have no input from one side.    </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As I'm sure others have stated, your brain normally works to interpret data and so ignores the closed eye in order to better process information from the open eye. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I have a lazy eye and astigmatism (weak right eye), so this doesn't work as well for me. If I close my good eye, I see the back of my eyelid with the vision from my bad eye layered on top of it. If I close my good eye, I'm aware of the lack of peripheral vision from my bad eye, but I don't see the back of my eyelid. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>My brain has developed a bias toward ignoring my bad eye regardless of if it's open or closed. Mainly because the images seen in both eyes don't align properly. If I purposefully try to use my bad eye with both my eyes open, I have a partially transparent, lower clarity image above and to the right of my good eye's image. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>An extra weirdness is that I'm right handed naturally. However, due to having a weak right eye, there are tasks I perform left handed and others for which I have no preference. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
