		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the way I understand it is that the bodies response to stress is to change the priorities of the body to support fight or flight, which means sending increased blood to the limbs to prepare for whatever happens, because in a survival situation anxiety means you may have to run or fight to survive.</p>
<p>this re-allocation of energy leaves less energy for things like digestion or normal cognitive function, so if it goes on for too long, you'll start to experience indigestion and possibly light headedness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fight or flight has been described, but I want to explain adrenaline rushes alone don't cause that light headed feeling, or it wouldn't be an effective means of dealing with stress or danger. Enter our friend, the vagus nerve.</p>
<p>The vagus nerve is a long, fat, branching nerve that goes from the brain to the digestive tract, and it's responsible for that queasy feeling of anxiety, even though its job is to make you feel 100%. </p>
<p>When it's operating normally, every time you get a dose of adrenaline, your vagus nerve goes &quot;chill, bro&quot; and counters with the release of other hormones that let you control the situation. It turns OFF fight or flight. It does this by lowering your heart rate, dilating blood vessels to lower your blood pressure, slowing your breathing. </p>
<p>BUT if you have chronic anxiety or have been anxious for a while, it's getting activated TOO MUCH.  So if it's overstimulated, it does too much. That's why your heart will be hammering away and then you may suddenly feel light headed and queasy. It's lowered your blood pressure too much in an attempt to counter the effects of adrenaline. When someone looks &quot;green&quot; with anxiety their body is reacting to the prolonged pumping of adrenaline by dumping a bunch of hormones at once into the blopdstream. Now you're puke and in a cold sweat.</p>
<p>To help with this, deep slow breathing paired with sitting or laying down will help turn &quot;off&quot; the vagus stimulation AND the adrenaline release until the body can regulate like its normal circumstances.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think some other responses have hit most of this, but...</p>
<p>When someone experiences anxiety, it's essentially your body activating &quot;fight or flight&quot; and giving itself adrenaline to do one of those things. With generalized anxiety, that response is triggered but there is nothing to tangibly fight or run from, so the adrenaline just goes through the body without being properly used. </p>
<p>As someone else said, this also involves diverting blood to the areas of the body that would be necessary for fight or flight - mainly your arms/ legs. Combine that with your increased heart rate and your stomach and head are going to be having a bad time.</p>
<p>Somewhat related, possibly the largest concentration of serotonin in the body is in your gut. Serotonin is the neurotransmitter most commonly associated with depression and anxiety. As such, bodily responses, and even medication, related to depression and anxiety can affect that area of the body. </p>
<p>Source: I've had this explained to me a few times between my behavioral science degrees and my own diagnosed depression/ anxiety (along with medications for them).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This diagram explains it well. Like others have said, your body prioritises the fight or fight response to save you from physical danger. We dont have as many physical dangers but your body can't distinguish between a tiger in the room or your own negative thoughts. If you're not going to be alive in a few minutes, you don't need to process food, therefore your stomach muscles relax  </p>
<p>This diagram explains it well: <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=fight+or+flight+in+the+body&prmd=ivn&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjnhdbC5PXsAhVJeMAKHX-RArAQ_AUoAXoECCoQAQ&biw=360&bih=572&dpr=3#imgrc=YYJl83tnqUnXXM" target="_blank">https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=fight+or+flight+in+the+body&prmd=ivn&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjnhdbC5PXsAhVJeMAKHX-RArAQ_AUoAXoECCoQAQ&biw=360&bih=572&dpr=3#imgrc=YYJl83tnqUnXXM</a></p>
