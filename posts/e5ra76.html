		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I understand the concept of ground water.  On Oak Island they continually make the distinction that when they dig deep enough sea water fills their bore holes.  Is the presence of sea/salt water anomalous when digging on a small island that is surrounded by sea water?</p>
<p>Would typical geology be porous enough to allow salt water to flow/seep beneath the ground?  It seems to me that this would not be a strange thing to encounter.  But, I am not a geologist.  </p>
<p>Not really looking for opinions on the show itself, but a serious answer regarding this specific feature.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div></div>

<p>(I live about 40km from Oak Island)</p>
<p>Btw I am a geologist and yeah, cracks in the bedrock will allow salt water under the island, there is no need for man made tunnels. It is an extremely tiny island after all. Again all part of the hype.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sea water finds are their attempt to uphold the ongoing belief there are man made tunnels &quot;booby trapping&quot; the treasure from robbers. Freshwater means they're digging in the wrong spot. But saltwater? ... well now... C'mon... It 'had' to be the depositors digging trap tunnels. </p>
<p>The Lagina bros are most assuredly extracting the only true fortune to be found on Oak Island via the TV show and media/publication rights.</p>
<p>That said; the historical element, archeological structures, and few artifacts found are interesting.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way freshwater accumulates on small islands depends very much on the geological, hydrogeological and geophysical conditions. Vegetation affects underground water salinity as does rainfall history. Even the very act of them pumping out their pit will cause a potential change in underground water salinity dynamics. Salt water doesn’t desalinate because it passes through porous rock or sand, so any freshwater on the island usually gets there via rainfall and is stored in the underground aquifers. When you get saltwater intrusion it’s because saline water moves into freshwater aquifers due to pumping out of the fresh.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no basis for a belief in a &quot;treasure&quot;, and there's no manmade &quot;flood tunnels&quot;.</p>
<p>The original story of a &quot;there is treasure buried here&quot;:</p>
<ol>
<li>there is no extant evidence of any of this story... no one knows what happened to these remarkable things in the story</li>
<li>the story really isn't possible.  Pirates did not bury treasure.  Why would you leave a marker specifying to anyone that you'd buried it there?  And you can't dig on Oak Island very far at all.  If you did bury anything deep, it's not safe.  Salt water will come in.</li>
</ol>
<p>The original &quot;money pit&quot; was a sinkhole, very common in the area. &quot;layers of log platforms&quot; found- well, you don't build platforms when digging a hole at all.  You shore up the sides, but that's not this.  These are just logs sucked into a sinkhole.</p>
<p>The &quot;flood tunnels&quot; are not manmade.  In fact there really isn't such a thing as a manmade &quot;flood tunnel&quot; and it would not be possible to build.  The flooding of excavations is going to happen because of natural water flooding- Oak Island is unusual geology of having a fantastic depth of glacial till (gravel) over bedrock and it does create unusual flooding of excavations.  Again, why you could not bury treasure there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I live in Indiana and hired a well driller to drill a natural gas well.  Unfortunately they hit saltwater before they hit gas at around 900 ft roughly.  That’s about our elevation above sea level.  Indiana is pretty far inland.... so I’m guessing it would be not at all unusual to hit saltwater when you drill on an island.  We live out of town so we have well water...it’s at 300 ft.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
