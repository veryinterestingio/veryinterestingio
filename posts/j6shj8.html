		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depending on the port, raising some of the sails may be a viable way to get out of dock.  Generally they would raise one of the triangular sails which can work a much larger angle off the wind.</p>
<p>Another option is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warping_(sailing\)" target="_blank">warping or kedging</a> and involves dropping a small anchor and pulling the ship to that.  They could put it on a small boat and have them paddle it out ahead so that the ship could pull it in and thus pull itself along.</p>
<p>While this seems slow, remember that most ships of this era were rather slow even under full sail with good wind.  The HMS Victory had a top speed of 11 knots and the Mayflower would do 4 knots.</p>
<p>Raising full sails while in a harbor wasn't done often because harbors are inherently low wind places but could have pockets of high wind.  Raising topsails that catch the occasional strong gust could cause a ship to tip dangerously far over as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasa_(ship\)" target="_blank">Vasa</a> learned the hard way</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They did raise their sails and sail away from the dock. They could not do it when the wind was against them.  And they could not sail away from shore while the tide was coming in.</p>
<p>Sailing ships were very dependent on the weather and tides.  They could not just depart whenever they wanted.  Nor could they sail in whatever direction they wanted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ships would be warped along a quay or across a dock to put them into a position from which they could sail. Then they would sail.</p>
<p>Warping a boat basically means pulling it around with ropes.</p>
<p>As an example of the issues faced by sailing ships, in 1938 Moshulu departed Belfast bound for Australia. She tried to beat down the Irish sea against the wind, but was unable to do so as the sea was too narrow. So after several days of trying this she turned around and sailed North around Ireland and into the Atlantic where she had enough space to make way to windward.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In many harbors, sailing vessels wouldn't dock, but would anchor offshore and be unloaded by smaller boats.</p>
<p>In addition to the various methods mentioned by other commenters, one of the early applications of steam was for precisely this problem. Some of the earliest steam vessels were actually tugboats, whose job was to tow sailing vessels in harbors and coastal waters. The first steam-powered paddle tugboat entered service in 1801, and steam tugs were in use for most of the 19th century. By comparison, the first seagoing steamships date to the 1820s and 1830s, and steam didn't start to really replace sail for a number of years after that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever heard the phrase “we sail with the tide”. ? A lot of ports, such as London and New York are on tidal rivers. If you release the ropes at high tide you can float gently away from the dock on slack water, but then get carried out to sea on several knots of current from the falling tide. You only need sails to adjust course enough to avoid other ships.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
