Why? If we know exactly how fast it is going, exactly where it is, and (pretty much) exactly on what path, why don't we know exactly where it is going to end up?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is that &quot;Pretty much&quot; part that is the real problem.  Being off by a hundredth of a degree turns into being off by thousands of km after traveling tens of millions of km.  The uncertainty of later interactions is just on top of that uncertainty in &quot;Pretty much&quot;.   Every little change has an uncertainty to it, and that uncertainty balloons into some very real distances fairly quickly when dealing with astronomical travel.</p>
<p>Even at the very most basic, a tiny uncertainty in the direction can become a very large difference between predicted and actual location, because of the huge distances involved.  And then there are unpredictable gravitational or collisional interactions en route that can slightly modify trajectories, and even if small in magnitude at the location of the event, the difference after much travel is large because of the long distances involved.</p>
<p>The opposite side of a triangle with an angle of 0.001 degree (thousandth of a degree) would be on the order of 1,000 km when the side is about 50 million km long. If you are off in interpreted trajectory by even that tiny little angle, the change in location becomes huge across space distances.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gravity is easy. If you have a sufficiently long observation time then usually we can predict the ideal &quot;gravitational trajectory&quot; centuries in advance. Takes some computing power but that's not a big deal any more today. It only becomes difficult if there is a close fly-by, because then tiny changes in the orbit lead to very large changes later.</p>
<p>The problem comes from non-gravitational forces. Radiation from the Sun can convert some matter on the surface to gas, which escapes and changes the trajectory a bit. The asteroid absorbs radiation, which comes with momentum, and then radiates this power away again, which also comes with momentum. To make things worse they also come with angular momentum, changing the rotation of the asteroid. Now imagine a tumbling asteroid where you need to predict all these effects. Over many years they add up.</p>
