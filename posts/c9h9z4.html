In combat, if the enemy lay down their weapons and surrender you shall not engage, but we saw U Boats in WWII constantly torpedoing US liberty ships and cargo, many of which did not have defense capabilities (but still a crew).

<p>An unarmed soldier is still a target.  Buildings full of unarmed soldiers (doing work that doesn't require a gun) are still targeted.  If a soldier throws down their weapons and flees they are still a target.</p>
<p>If a cargo ship surrenders (not trying to save the cargo by fleeing), they are a surrendered opponent.</p>
<p>Note the definition of combatant requires you be part of the armed forces, not that you actually be armed: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combatant" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combatant</a></p>
<p>As for why a cargo ship would be a valid target, it would be an &quot;objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose (destruction) offers a definite military advantage.&quot;

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Shooting unarmed soldiers isn't a war crime. Unarmed soldier could be commanding a unit by radio, they could be spotter for artillery, they could be a spy, they could be be part of the logistical branch. That's exactly what cargo ship crew were. They were not direct combatant, but they were helping in the war effect and were a legitimate target. The same thing would be true for civilian working in a military factory.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>What you were talking about isn't about shooting unarmed soldiers, but shooting soldiers that surrender. That's because the treatment of prisoner of war are specified in the Geneva convention and so shooting one of them is a war crime.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anything that bears the flag of the enemy is a target. Just because it isn't armed doesn't mean it has no military value.  Surrendering on a ship basically means abandoning it because there isn't going to be a boarding party trying to enter it when all modes of attack are long distance and you're not going to abandon ship unless it's close to sinking.</p>
<p>A submarine is in a way like a sniper at sea: It's going to attack unnoticed from cover without warning because in a head on fight it's going to lose. In that sense even an unarmed cargo has an offensive capability because it will call in the subs position as soon as it notices it and the sub has no real possibility to make them surrender before doing so. And after that call the sub has no time to stay around because it's going to get sunk real quick otherwise.</p>
<p>Apart from that WW2 was far from a 'clean' war anyway...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of U Boats DID surface and request a surrender of cargo vessels to allow the crews to evacuate. But eventually escorts began using that to target them and destroy them. As the war went on it became safer for UBoats to not bother with warninga and just sink the ships.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
