		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. This is generally correct. N/m^2 or lb/in^2 (psi) and other derivatives. </p>
<p>It can be hard to find. As it’s a) not quite that simple- the backing provides a certain strength so adhesive is strength usually measures just pulling directly away from the plane of the backing. And b) temperature dependence. (See below)</p>
<p>I rarely see this value for tapes you get in the store. It’s frequently given for industrial grade tapes. 3M website is a good place to look because many products do have it. And they make a lot of tape. But not all of them have the value. </p>
<p>It’s also complicated by the fact that adhesive strength for most tapes varies with temperature. When quite cold the adhesive is hard and not sticky. When warm it’s very sticky and can get runny. So they usually give 2 or 3 values (for industrial tapes) @ 0C 30C 60C</p>
<p>Also relevant for your bandaids example. You’d want good adhesive properties around 60C, but you need it to be less than the sheer strength of skin- which can be quite low in the elderly or edematous.  It’s a tough trade off. Because that regular bandaid you stick on your finger has no chance of staying, but those athletic ones will stick until you rip it off- generally leaving adhesive behind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adhesive strength is measured as a pressure, as others have pointed out, but just knowing that doesn't give you the full picture.</p>
<p>Try sticking down a sticky-note and peeling it up.  It's really easy.  Now try to push it across the surface with a sliding motion.  It's much more difficult.  That's the difference between peel strength and shear strength.  When you use superglue to stick two broken ends of a rod back together and pull them, that's tensile strength.</p>
<p>All these different situations have their own kind of strength, and one adhesive may not be good at all of them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several ways tape is measured:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Peel Adhesion</strong>: the strength of the bond between a tape and the application surface. This is measure in the force required to peel a standard size from a standard surface (usually a stainless steel panel).  The force is measured in ounces-per-one inch of tape, or the metric equivalent of Newtons. There are two ways this is tested: pulling the  tape at 90° of the surface (perpendicular) or pulling the tape 180° of the surface (backwards). I think this is the one you are referring to </li>
<li><strong>Cohesion</strong>: the internal strength of an adhesive to the backing. This is an observational measurement.</li>
<li><strong>Shear</strong>: measure of the internal or cohesive strength of the adhesive, or the ability of an adhesive to resist creep or slippage. This is measure in units of time prior to the tape sloping under controlled conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Tack</strong>: the ability of a tape to create an immediate bond,</li>
<li><strong>Tensile Strength</strong>: is the force (or load) required to break a tape. Also measured in ounces-per-one inch of tape, or the metric equivalent of Newtons.</li>
<li><strong>Elongation</strong>: the percent in which a tape can be stretched just before breaking. If the tape is designed to stretch it is measured in ounces-per-one inch of tape, or the metric equivalent of Newtons.</li>
<li><strong>Thickness</strong>: Obviously measured in thousandths of an inch or mils.</li>

<p>ran this test when I worked in an adhesive lab.  there are jigs that are made to make sure the 90 degree angle is kept when using a regular tensile machine.  (IIRC there is also a 180 degree test as well).  </p>
<p>We also had a &quot;tackiness&quot; homebrew test that we ran that used a machine that they used to test gum and other things. (tackiness over time was important as well, hence an auto-test)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As /u/TheBraveOne86, the &quot;correct&quot; unit is generally pascal or psi. I put &quot;correct&quot; in quotes because while a &quot;strength&quot; <em>is</em> generally a force per unit area, for adhesive tapes, the standards (e.g. ASTM D903 - 98(2017)) call for a value given in units of (force / width). This unit is far more useful for commercially-available tapes, because it doesn't require any assumptions about or measurements of the contact patch and the behavior of the adhesive in combined shear-tensile loading. People are interested simply in knowing: if I apply an inch (or 25mm)-wide strip of tape, how much force will it take to peel it back?</p>
<p>So, for example, the peel strength (the force required to peel the adhesive tape backwards at a particular rate and angle, for example either 90&deg; or 180&deg; to the interface) is typically specified in N/cm or lbf (or ozf)/in. </p>
<p>Peel strength is variable based on surface, of course -- adhesives generally don't adhere as strongly to some things as to others -- but here are some representative numbers:</p>
<p><a href="https://3m.citrination.com/pif/000770?locale=en-US" target="_blank">3M All Purpose Duct Tape DT8</a>: 180&deg; peel strength on stainless steel after initial application of 8.1 N/cm or 74 oz/in; their Heavy-Duty Duct Tape D11 <a href="https://3m.citrination.com/pif/000771?locale=en-US" target="_blank">has a peel strength of 9.6 N/cm or 88 oz/in</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0846.2004.00082.x?sid=nlm%3Apubmed" target="_blank">3M Durapore surgical tape:</a> variable based on person, but 180&deg; peel strength on human skin of about 0.4 to 1 N/cm </p>
<p><a href="https://pharmahub.org/resources/635/download/Bandage_Comparison_Lab-Instructors_Guide.pdf" target="_blank">A Rowan University lab</a> found actual adhesive plasters to have a 180&deg; peel strength on porcine skin of about 0.3 to 2 N/cm depending on brand and type of bandage (plastic or cloth backing)</p>
<hr />
<p>A good ballpark estimate seems to be that duct tape is about 10x as difficult to peel off a surface than medical bandages.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
