		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what's been mentioned so far, we don't have high strength for our size, but we have one of the best capabilities for endurance among all animals (not just those our size). About the only animal with higher endurance than us are the dogs often used in sled racing.  </p>
<p>So we are &quot;weaker&quot; in terms of raw strength, but we have a scary potential for endurance compared to most animals.  </p>
<p>Part of that endurance comes down to our bodies only maintaining enough strength for our recent needs, which is why we need to train to gain and maintain strength.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This is a great lecture that touches on the subject.</p>
<p>There is something called the &quot;expensive tissue hypothesis&quot;. In essence, the brain consumes a large number of calories compared to other organs. In humans it seems the brain consumes around 300 calories per day.</p>
<p>The human brain is larger in relation to the body mass of humans, as compared to any other animals (we have much larger brains compared to other animals, as a proportion of body size).</p>
<p>There is a trade-off in other organs, to reduce the total calorie demands that we need to take in each day. We have smaller digestive tracts that other primates. And we also have less muscle mass. And yet we thrived as a species. Better than any other mammal.</p>
<p>It's suggested that because early humans were able to scavange fat from bone marrow of large animals killed by other predators, we were able to obtain a lot of calories for minimal effort. Fat has 9 calories per gram, compared to 4 calories per gram for carbohydrates and protein. So eating fat gave us the most bang for our buck. And we evolved by getting better at finding fat (became better scavengers, and better hunters).</p>
<p>No other animal could access the fat in bone marrow because they couldn't figure out how to use tools to break the bones (actually, a couple types of birds are known to drop bones from great heights).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans are endurance predators. Compared to a deer we are a Duracell  battery. A human can hunt and kill a larger and faster animal simply by following at a moderate pace until it becomes exhausted and must rest. This would take hours and hours for us but  maybe 1 hour for a deer or something.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our closest relative the Chimpanzees  are stronger than us.</p>
<p>There are two types of muscle fibers in our skeletal muscles, fast-twitch and slow-twitch.<br />
The fast-twitch are good for fast contraction like you need to spring and for strength to lift a lot of stuff. They can operate at full power for a short duration of time<br />
Slow-twitch are slower but have a lot more endurance so good for long duration work.</p>
<p>The main difference between use and chimps is how much of each type we have. Chimps has more fast and we more slow.<br />
Chimps has evolve for forest life and tree climbing so getting away from predator fast up in trees and just climbing up in general s a huge advantage.</p>
<p>Humans have evolved on the planes and are very good at moving long distances and to do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_hunting" target="_blank">Persistence_hunting</a>. Thar is following after animals and get in range  and kill them when they are fatigued or overheated. San people in the Kalahari Desert, and by the Rar√°muri people of Northwestern Mexico still do that. Look up a video because it is quite impressive.  </p>
<p>Humans are the best or one of the best land animal for long distance moment. The competitor is horses, wolfs, camels. and similar animals<br />
Look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_versus_Horse_Marathon" target="_blank">Man_versus_Horse_Marathon</a> that is a 22 miles (35 km) race of a runner vs a rider and horse in Wales. The riders will run along the horse. The time will be quite similar amd humans have won twice in 39 years.  The time difference is lower if it is warmer and would be even more in condition you find in Africa.<br />
Our muscles are  one part of the but out ability to sweat and cool down is another. We can also carry water with use that animals can't</p>
<p>So humans are physically very good at one think, likely because we used it historically as a way to get food.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Human also have a lot higher precision in the moment of out arms and fingers. So better at throwing a spear with precision or use tools to do stuff.<br />
This is also a tradeoff where humans and chimps had different needs and evolved in different way.</p>
<p>We also evolved brain for tool usage and cooperation. Humans are social animals and live in groups. Human ancestor have hunted with spears for at least 400,000 year and there is indication of stone tipped spears 500,000 year ago. Just wood spear will be older but harder to find since they are just wood that can rot. So the usage start with ancestors to out species.</p>
<p>Even if human just have wood spear we can work together and defeat any animal that would try to attack us for food.  We can also hunt down and kill any animals.<br />
So we used our brain and tools to beat physical strength.</p>
<p>The human dominance over earth and ability to live in more diverse condition then any other animal show that out way was the more successful. We do not need physical strength.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The actual strength difference between us and say a chimpanzee is very exaggerated actually, yes they are slightly stronger pound for pound but animal muscles aren't automatically twice as strong as humans. Usable strength is a function of many things, the most influential of which except size are muscle structure (penate, parallel, fusiform) and skeletal structure (where the muscle actually attaches) it simply comes down to geometry in most cases. Things like muscle type and neurological differences are valid too, but none of them will effectively double your bicep curl quite like relocating your bicep insertion point 2 inches closer to your hand. As another commenter said, we really are built for efficiency, our relatively spindly structure gives us many advantages such as flexibility, limb speed and reach. If you took a chimpanzee and a human of the same weight and had both of them deadlift something, the chimp would likely be able to lift more, but the human would also have to lift it 5x higher, literally doing more work. There's a reason a 500lb squat is more impressive than a 700lb calf raise. To answer your question though, in most cases animals outperform humans in terms of maximum force output purely because of leverage or just shear size.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
