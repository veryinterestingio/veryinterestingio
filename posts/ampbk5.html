		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's mostly B. With our techniques we can mostly detect planets that are massive enough to make their stars wobble, or big enough to make a dent in their brightness AND do so fast enough for us to detect the pattern. This is why most exosystems found so far are so similar, yet so different to ours. Detecting planets like our trans saturnian ones would be almost impossible with either technique (brightness dip too small, orbital period too slow)</p>
<p>Edit: Thank you for the silver!</p>
<p>Edit 2: I went and looked for the original comment I'm quoting down below, and I haven't found it yet but I did find another thread which I found interesting back at the time. It touches up on the subject of our current bias for detecting exoplanets in certain configurations of solar systems rather than things more akin to our own: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/7pgij2/scientists_have_discovered_our_solar_system_is/?sort=top" target="_blank">check it out!</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is almost certainly b. Since they are too dark to be directly imaged, the existence of dim and distant objects such as exoplanets has to be inferred through crunching data. It just so happens that big objects are easier to detect, which is why the current list is all massive planets.</p>
<p>As our detection methods improve we'll start finding smaller and smaller things around other stars for certain.</p>
<p>There's no reason not to suspect all star systems have millions of satellites of various sizes and categories. We just can't 'see' them yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>“Within our picture, single low-mass, sunlike stars are not primordial,” Stahler added. “They are the result of the breakup of binaries. ”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It appears that young star systems are often wide binary (500 AU separation) and then either migrate closer (for example, Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Century B are 11 AU apart).  This makes having planets a more complicated endeavor.</p>
<p>Our Sun 'got away from' its twin and maintained its planets rather than becoming a closer binary system and possibly ejecting its planets.</p>
<p>Low mass stars (red dwarves) - which are the majority of stars out there - are a different story for the percent in binary systems.</p>

<p>So the sun isn't an anomaly, nor is it unique... but it appears to be in the minority of stars.  Thus, mostly B, but there's a bit of A in there too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>a) it might be but we dont know yet! We are only just at the beginning of exoplanet observations and there are many things we thought we knew that are being questioned. Things that often get spoken about in popsci as if they are solved are in fact nowhere near to being complete and often have a few big hurdles left (a couple of examples are core accretion has a big problem with the pebble accretion scale as well as explaining the population of hot Jupiters around young stars, the nebular hypothesis has problems explaining the misalignment of hot Jupiters and more generally the misalignment of protoplanetary disks). These questions have came about due to increasing observations and we are finding the variety is so large that we still do not have enough data points.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One interesting idea that has came out of exoplanetary surveys is that there may be two populations of protoplanetary disk. One of which can result in a planetary system and one that can not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b) this is very important. Along side this is our detection ranges in that we have a bias in detection of planets &lt;1AU from the star. If we consider an identical system to ours and then think about how many of our planets we would observe then we end up fairly typical! We would likely observe our system as a single plant (or at a push a two planet) system also. I would guess we are above average on the number of planets in the system but not by much (and would also not be surprised to be wrong). But it is important to note that this would be for a specific type of system! Not all protoplanetary disks will produce planets at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>c) the sun is fairly typical for its size as far as we can tell. We know a bit more about stars than planets, we a lot more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is b).</p>
<p>Imagine we were instead inhabitants of Tau Ceti e, or some other nearby exoplanet, and the Sun is just one of many bright stars in the sky. And imagine that this hypothetical planet had the same exact technology/astronomy as we currently do. How many planets would our Tau Ceti-ans have currently discovered around the Sun?</p>
<p>The answer is probably one - Jupiter. That's because our searches with Radial Velocity (the doppler wobble method) is so far only sensitive enough to detect the orbits of Jupiter-like giant planets. Saturn would likely be too small and on too long an orbit to detect, and Earth produces far too small a signal (\~100 times smaller than Jupiter).</p>
<p>Even in the unlikely chance that the Sun and its planets happened to align edge-on with Tau Ceti so that the planets cross their star or &quot;transit&quot; (a \~0.5% chance for Earth), none would probably have so far been spotted. That's because only a few thousand stars have been surveyed with the sensitivity to detect Venus &amp; Earth-like planets (with Kepler), and those were all relatively faint stars covering &lt;2% of the sky.</p>
<p>So if you looked up the hypothetical Tau-Ceti-equivalent-wikipedia for &quot;known exoplanets&quot;, it would say &quot;Sun - G2 dwarf, 1 exoplanet&quot;. But of course that does not mean exoplanet systems do not have \~8 planets in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
