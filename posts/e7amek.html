Take tonight, for example: half of my household has Step, I have a slight headache and cough, so I know I pretty much have it. But right now, I don’t feel too terrible really. </p>
<p>Tomorrow morning though, I fully expect to feel like I’ve been hit by a truck. This is something I’ve always wondered: why does it seem that the brutal effects of illness always occur after sleep, but hardly ever do I start to feel like trash over the course of the day?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sinuses and nasal passages drain during the day when you're upright. When you lie down, blood and fluids go more towards your head throughout the night, making you more congested. A cold = more mucous production, so more in your nasal passages. Add dehydration to the mix (since you're not drinking all or most of the night) and mucous thickens, making it more...unpleasant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Not exactly, but this article explains things pretty well, I think. It has to do with your body's circadian rhythm and when you are asleep your body still tries to fight off the illness. You would still feel like trash if you were to stay up while initially getting sick (and probably worse because sleep also enables your body to better fight off illness) so the reason you feel worse in the morning is because of simple passage of time and natural progression of the illness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As it gets darker outsider / later in the day, your body has a lower level of a hormone cortisone and a higher level of the hormone melatonin. Cortisone suppresses inflammation. As the levels of cortisone in the body decrease the cold and flu symptoms tend to worsen, because the suppression is reduced. Most illness that is the result of inflammation will tend to have symptoms that worsen over night and &quot;get better&quot; during the day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
