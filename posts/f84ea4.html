		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically yes you could pop like a balloon if enough blood was forced into your circulatory system.  Realistically, you'd go into congestive heart failure first.  Basically the pressure in the system (your blood pressure) would get so high that your heart would be unable to generate enough force to expell any blood.  </p>
<p>This happens to people in the hospital all the time, and they are put on food restricted diets and weighed daily to monitor their fluid load.  Some people need to be dialyzed to take the fluid out.  Butt lowering the fluid lowers the pressure and allows the heart to keep pumping</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would say it more results in pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs) than explicitly saying it results in heart failure. This might be me being more nitpicky than anything, but I go by the definition that CHF is defined as an inability for the heart to provide the rest of the body sufficient blood to meet its resource requirements.</p>
<p>Increasing the blood volume has no effect on the heart’s ability to meet corporeal requirements, but at a certain point Starling’s Law reaches its limit and the heart can’t compensate for any increased blood volume, so it gets stuck in the pulmonary vasculature causing pulmonary edema. This is pretty common with patients who have been given lots of crystalloids in particular, as blood products are usually reserved for much more severe cases where you’re far off from volume overload.</p>
<p>To OP, to visualize this, here is a depiction of curves that show what we’re talking about: <a href="https://d1yboe6750e2cu.cloudfront.net/i/1f647b2d4a1c07e90eb45f6d6c5035429b67af75" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
<p>The y axis is how much the heart can pump (red curve) and how much the venous system gives to the heart (blue curve). Our heart functions where those lines intersect. As you increase the blood volume, the blue line gets shifted up, like in graph B, and so the point of intersection moves up—you’ve increased the amount the heart pumps to compensate for the increased blood volume the venous system is delivering back to the heart.</p>
<p>But as you can see, that red line plateaus. Eventually, increasing blood volume can’t be compensated further, so the blood gets stuck in the pulmonary vasculature behind the left-heart, resulting in pulmonary edema. HOWEVER, heart failure has not occurred—the heart’s actually at peak functionality, and the other organs are still being supplied adequately.</p>
<p>TL;DR - you’ll drown long before anything pops.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other commenters answered the second part.
Regarding the first one: the donor blood is most often used to compensate for the blood loss. So they just do not pump new blood when you have your full amount. There is no strict limit on the mount of new blood. If you’ve lost 2 liters, you can get that 2 in donor blood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work as a blood bank tech at a level II trauma hospital. The most I have ever personally given to one pt during one MTP (Massive Transfusion Protocol) was 28 units of packed red blood cells, 28 units of plasma and 7 units apheresed platelets.</p>
<p>That patient, however, was hemorrhaging units as fast as we could get them in due to a ruptured AAA (abdominal aortic aneurysm). We could have gone on with more units however the patient ended up, unfortunately, passing away during surgery to repair the rupture.</p>
<p>We have had patients receive packed red blood cells because their hemoglobin had dropped and the doctor requests more units than they actually need. This leads to a transfusion reaction called TACO: Transfusion Associated Circulatory Overload in which they are put into a (hopefully temporary because it is caught/identified quickly and reversed) state of CHF.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctor here. For a young healthy person it would be difficult to overload them with blood or fluid because their heart and kidneys can compensate well. The vessels wouldn't really burst unless you infused the blood at incredible speed and pressure that would never be done. When the pressure gets too high in the circulatory system what happens is the watery part of the blood starts to leak out into the surrounding tissue, often in the lungs and lower extremities (edema).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
