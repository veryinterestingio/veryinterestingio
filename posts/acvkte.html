<p>Edit: Wow, the replies on here are really fantastic, thank you guys!</p>
<p>TIL: the iconic &quot;dive-bomber diving&quot; sound we all know is actually the sound of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkers_Ju_87" target="_blank">WWII German Ju87 Stuka Dive Bomber</a>. It was the sound of a siren placed on the plane's gear legs and was meant to instil fear and hopefully make the enemy scatter instead of shooting back.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/5uvqhA4_2tU" target="_blank">Here's some archive footage</a> - thank you u/BooleanRadley for the link and info</p>
<p>Turns out we associate the sound with any old-school dive-bombers because of Hollywood. This kind of makes me think of how we associate the sound of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVBxLXyleyQ" target="_blank">Red Tailed Hawks</a> screeching and calling with the sound of Bald Eagles (<a href="https://youtu.be/PQ2uMauyBow?t=35" target="_blank">they actually sound like this</a>) thanks to Hollywood.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The noise you are thinking of is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nX_nx6Qws" target="_blank">Jericho Trumpet</a>. They were specifically mounted on German Stuka dive bombers just to freak people out as they came in for an attack. It was a kind of psychological warfare designed to divert the enemies focus towards something they couldn't actually do anything about.</p>
<p>The sound effect is often added to any kind of plane going into a dive in movies, which created the misconception that all prop planes in a dive sound like that, but it's not accurate. There is a slight whine you get from planes in a dive caused by the Doppler effect and the increasing air speed causing the prop to spin at a higher RPM, which in turn increases the pitch of the engine note, but that pronounced scream was unique to Junkers. </p>
<p>They were mounted on the landing strut. <a href="http://u.cubeupload.com/schmidty/JerichoTrumpet2.jpg" target="_blank">Here's a photograph of one</a>. As the plane went into the dive it would accelerate. Air passing over them would drive the small props and create a similar effect to an air raid siren, the acceleration coupled with the Doppler effect creating the unnerving ever rising screaming sound.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=074YZ2PJK7M" target="_blank">Here is a Spitfire and a Messerschmitt by comparison</a>. There's still a slight whistling whine to the approach but it's much more subtle.</p>
<p>Edit - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUEKjmtQ9Q" target="_blank">Found a better example of what a Spitfire sounds like in a dive</a>. You can clearly hear the engine tone rising here as it accelerates. Different planes will sound different depending on the type of engine they have, Spitfires had enormous V12s which made them deep and throaty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sound you're thinking of isn't something you hear when every propeller plane dives. It's a iconic sound from German Ju 87's. They had fans attached to the landing gear that acted as sirens during a dive. Basically it was a tactic to make a wider area of enemies fearful of the dive bomber attack. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the Stuka &quot;Jericho trumpets&quot;, there were &quot;whistling bombs&quot;.  The idea was indeed to instill panic, not warn people to take cover to save them while destroying the assets. The siren attachments caused enough drag to be a considerable drag  hit but they thought it was impressive enough to justify it.  Branding, possibly intended as much to entertain the pilots with a signature wail as to instill fear.  </p>
<p>The sirens were fitted to each landing gear and had their own prop about 2ft dia to generate power for their vanes, at the expense of drag.  It eats a lot of hp.</p>
<p>Well, actually drag brakes are necessary anyways to keep the plane's speed manageable in a dive.  But the sirens were fixed and had a lesser whistle at all times during cruise, slowing the plane by 10-20 mph and announcing your travel long before the attack.  The whole landing gear was fixed too, for simplicity at a huge drag cost.  The Ju 87 was built as a short range bomber, with neither the range nor speed to execute long range attacks.</p>
<p>Also the generic &quot;bomb drop&quot; whistle sound was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa0KMNgbp5E" target="_blank">actually a whistle added in some WWII bombs</a>.  Normally bombs make a distinct rushing sound (commonly experienced with mortar rounds, but bombs with no whistles make very little sound), but not that screaming whistle unless you add a whistle.</p>
<p>AFAIK they were not used after WWII.</p>
<p>Soundclips of both got used extensively in Looney Tunes.</p>
<p>Yep it makes no sense, but it got instilled as the a trope, and people expect it.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
