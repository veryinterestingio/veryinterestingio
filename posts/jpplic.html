They came up with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoplasma_laboratorium" target="_blank">mycoplasma_laboratorium</a>. The Wikipedia article discusses a few related efforts, too. These genomes include many genes with unknown function that are necessary, so we don't understand these cells fully yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It really depends how you want to define your goal. Does the organism need a metabolism or defined cell membrane? If not, then a piece of DNA that self replicates could be the smallest “genome”; however it may be stretching the definition a bit. It’s possible life started as just self replicating biopolymers. </p>
<p>An example:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the experimentally derived smallest genomes lose function. Meaning they can only grow in very specific conditions. A bacterial genome has a lot of metabolic variety so it can turn on genes depending on what food source is available and what the environment is like. As you remove genes, you also remove survival options.</p>
<p>Compare to a car, what is the minimal car? Do you need doors, windshield, catalytic converter, air bags. You can strip it down but eventually you get a vehicle that only works in a very limited manner.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am not quite sure this counts as it required outside setup, but there is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiegelman%27s_Monster" target="_blank">Spiegelman's Monster</a>, an RNA fragment that is 218 nucleotides long that can <del>self</del> replicate. Originally he got the genetic material from a bacteriophage that was 3300 nucleotides long, and removed selective pressure from it, so it lost the RNA over generations that coded for coat proteins etc. This meant the smallest RNA strings replicated far more quickly, and outcompeted longer strands for replication. Eventually it was just this tiny string of RNA replicating</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT: <del>I will need to look into it more to see if it was actually self replicating or required an outside enzyme.</del>  It needs a replicase added to begin with to start the process</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe there are regular experiments with specues of the bacterial genus &quot;Mycoplasma&quot;, which have a very small genome. Genes can be removed and then it's observed whether it's still functional.  This does not mean that would be the smallest functional genome though, there could be other setups that are smaller, but function.</p>
<p>I'm by no means an expert though, but my microbiology teacher back in 2017 mentioned this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
