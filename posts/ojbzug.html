		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're looking at the issue from a wrong perspective.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>First of all, I'm going to be talking about Christian democrat parties (not Christians overall).</strong></p>
<p>So the Left/Right political scale was a consequence of the divide - it came after the Progressive and Christian parties were formed just as a way to categorize them.</p>
<p>Why were Christians put on the right? Because they are usually the ones pushing for status quo or in other word - defending tradition.</p>
<p>On the flip side, progressives gain their name because they want to change the status quo and so we have an inpass and that is party politics in any country.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>In terms of Jesus being socially progressive.</strong> I think we should ask whether the progressive ideas of Jesus and modern progressive ideas are actually the same.</p>
<p>I'd argue, that at that time, Jesus was a revolutionary and wanted to establish a &quot;new world order&quot; which was a Christian world. Now the same people try to defend it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Just to add - Conservatism means a lot of things in different countries.</strong> At bare bones - it's defending tradition - what is tradition to a certain country differs wildly. (it might have nothing to do with religion) But that's another topic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are (at least) two factors at play. Firstly what you describe is largely a US issue with much less correlation between faith and political leaning in other countries.</p>
<p>Secondly, some of this stems from the conflating of social and economic issues in two-party systems. A high proportion of religious people are socially conservative, especially as a result of religious focus on the importance of family and a certain type of community. In the US that social conservatism also comes with e.g. opposition to gay marriage and some other things that are less prevalent in European Christianity. In modern western democracy social conservatism and economic conservatism (a belief in the free market, desire for small government) go hand in hand.</p>
<p>In theory it is possible to combine social conservatism with big spending on social welfare programmes and suchlike; indeed this is what the current Conservative UK government of Boris Johnson is <em>[somewhat]</em> doing, in contrast to the austerity of previous Conservative administrations.</p>
<p><em>Edit: I appreciate that the current Tory government is not spending big in all areas, I merely wish to draw a contrast with previous administrations to show that social and economic conservatism do not have to coincide.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You've gotten answers all over the place here, but Jesus never advocated for the civil government to enact any of His teachings. He taught that His followers should do it willingly and in love. This conflicts with the politics on both sides of the aisle</p>
<p>And for a more thorough answer as to why American Christians tend to certain politics, Phil Vischer gives a pretty balanced explanation in his video <a href="https://youtu.be/W4eS2E-PoGo" target="_blank">Why do White Christians Vote Republican, and Black Christians Vote Democrat? </a> if you have 15 minutes</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
