		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cancer itself can cause weight loss because of the metabolic expenditure (see: other comments explaining cachexia).</p>
<p>Cancers in the GI tract especially around the stomach, pancreas and initial small bowel can cause anorexia (lack of appetite), early satiety (feeling full quickly) and nausea, through tumour mass taking up physical space in the gut, through chemical release and through invasion of the nerves supplying the gut. It is because of these effects that unintentional weight loss over a relatively short period of time sets off alarm bells and is seen as a &quot;red flag symptom&quot;.</p>
<p>Treatments of cancer can also affect weight:</p>
<ul>
<li>chemotherapy can cause horrendous nausea and vomiting but can also strip away the lining of the bowel, causing inadequate absorption of your food. </li>
<li>chemotherapy is also very metabolically demanding; by essentially damaging cells throughout the body (hence why hair falls out), the body is forced to replenish them, those using energy</li>
<li>radiation treatments of the mouth, throat and chest can cause burns and scarring of the oesophagus and make it difficult or even uncomfortable to eat</li>
<li>plus surgeries etc are hugely demanding, not including bowel surgery affecting ingestion and absorption of food!!</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope that helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctor here. Cancer is metabolic expensive by itself. The own neoplasm will consume a lot of energy just by existing.
Tumor cells exhibit an upregulation in glycolysis, glycogen metabolism, and gluconeogenesis. This means they invest a lot on using glucose and getting it from our glucose reserves and also proteic reserves.
This is called Warburg effect, search a bit and you'll find a world of information on this!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
