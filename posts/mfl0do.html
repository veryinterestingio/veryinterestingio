		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In classical thermodynamics, temperature can be associated with the distribution of velocities of particles (not only molecules) - the wider the distribution, the higher the speed of particles on average, and the higher the temperature.</p>
<p>At the microscopic level, particles can lose some energy related to this motion and radiate it away. This can be the energy level of electron orbitals, rotations and vibrations of molecules, lattice vibrations in a material, etc. The spectrum of light produced by thermal radiation depends only on temperature. You can calculate it, and it just so happens that it peaks close to the infrared for everyday temperatures. For temperatures close to those near the surface of the Sun (\~6000K), it peaks at visible light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everything produces a spectrum of light, but the exact wavelength distribution depends on how hot it is, and on the details of the chemical composition. The temperature sets the broad shape of the spectrum, which <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Black_body.svg" target="_blank">looks like this</a>. This &quot;thermal emission&quot; gives light in a lot of wavelengths, but for each temperature there is a broad peak of wavelengths, and long tails of less emission.</p>
<p>As things get hotter, they emit at shorter and shorter wavelengths (higher and higher frequencies). So, as you increase the temperature of an object, it will start to visibly glow red, then orange, then yellow, then white, then blue. (The peak is broad enough that you don't get a green glow - you get a mix of colours that add up to white-ish). The basic law is that if you double the temperature (in Kelvin [or Rankine I guess]), you double the frequency.</p>
<p>Additionally, the whole spectrum gets brighter as you increase the temperature. A yellow-hot element emits more red light than a red-hot element, but on top of that it also emits so much yellow that you can't see the red very well. This is a dramatic effect: an object that's twice as hot will produce 16x as much emission.</p>
<p>However, things at room temperature are too cold to emit in visible light. Instead, they emit light just below visible frequencies - in the infrared instead. But, as things get hotter, they emit higher frequency infrared light, as well as more intense infrared light at lower frequencies. So, at typical Earth temperatures, everything is emitting infrared, and warmer things are emitting more infrared, and it works as &quot;heat vision&quot;.</p>
<p>This is all for &quot;ideal blackbodies&quot; though. In reality, things are not perfect at thermal emission. You get a more complex spectrum, because molecules have complex interactions and prefer to emit or absorb light of specific frequencies. You can see this in the Sun's spectrum, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Solar_spectrum_en.svg" target="_blank">which is all chopped up</a>. At room temperature, these complications dominate the emission, which is why most objects have visible colour based on their chemical and physical properties other than temperature. But in the infrared, they do have an effect too, so you're not <em>only</em> looking at temperature in the infrared.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The easiest way to think about it is that you have a material made up of charged particles, and those particles always interact with the electromagnetic field. The nature of the interaction is not too important, but some of the other answers already gave some examples -- any time a particle accelerates, it produces light, any time you have a collision (say, of a phonon with a lattice defect) you can emit light, and so on.</p>
<p>The exact nature of the most important interactions will depend on the material. For example, we think of phonons in crystal lattices, not in liquids, but both radiate. The central point is that the stuff the material is made of is charged, and so interacts with the electromagnetic field. You can think of that as the material being <em>in contact with</em> the electromagnetic field in the same sense as in simple problems where a block of ice is in contact with some liquid water: the tendency will be for the two objects to try to achieve thermal equilibrium, which will result in a heat flow from the hot body to the cold &quot;body&quot;. That heat flow is what we see (at everyday temperatures) as infrared radiation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since no one else linked it, the term is <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation" target="_blank">thermal radiation</a>. Another common name is <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation" target="_blank">black-body radiation</a>, which is the thermal radiation of an object that is pure black.</p>
<p>The inability of classical theories to explain black-body radiation properly is what lead to the discovery of quantum mechanics.</p>
<hr />
<p>Also, to address a common point of confusion: infrared light is not heat. Heat is, as you said, the movement of molecules and their collisions. Everyday objects will radiate infrared light (losing some heat in the process), and also absorb light (gaining heat).</p>
<p>So-called &quot;heat-sensing goggles&quot; do not actual sense heat. They sense the infrared light which is an artifact of the heat, hence the common confusion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>other excellent replies aside, you're asking about two different things. molecular motion as temperature is different from thermal radiation as temperature. the atmosphere at a certain temperature imparts heat directly to your skin, for example, as molecules hit your skin and transfer momentum, infrared not required (convection). the net result is that your skin is approximately the same temperature as the air. radiant heat, as infrared, imparts heat to your skin as radiation that transfers momentum by absorption (radiative transfer), like if you're sitting in front of a fire, it warms you without touching the flame. if you're then asking how one causes the other, blackbody radiation is the answer, but heat transfer is usually a complex mix of convection and radiative transfer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
