<p>Why do each animal species sound almost similar to us? Why can't we appreciate voice variation in them as can we do in other humans?</p>
<p>And what really happens at puberty that cause male voice to become deeper and not of girls?</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for all the awesome replies guys! Didn't expected this question to blew up. I was kind of tripping on acid when I was typing this, I'd read everything properly when I am sobered up.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Social species learn to differentiate between members of their own species.  It's pretty rare when one species can do that with another species.  Some animals may sound all the same to us but sound unique to individuals within that species. I'm willing to bet that, if we could talk to birds, humans would sound all the same to them.  </p>
<p>An interesting counter-example of that has been dubbed the &quot;Crow Paradox&quot;.  You can raise a crow from the time it's a baby until adult but as soon as you set it free and it joins a murder of crows, you won't be able to tell it apart from other crows.  But, for some reason, crows are really good at telling humans apart.  Like scary good.  And no one really knows why.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As some other commenters have said, the shape of your vocal tract (respiratory tract, nose and mouth) influences the tone of your voice. This is a result of differences in how soundwaves bounce around in one person’s vocal tract vs. another’s. Scientific research shows that people can tell a speaker’s identity based on these differences. But it’s not only the anatomical shape of the vocal tract, but also how you use it. People can have different inflections, pronunciations, etc. (think of one accent vs another as one example) that can cue us into who is speaking. In fact, some research suggests that cell phones garble our voices so much that we rely on these inflection/pronunciation cues when recognizing someone over the phone. Actors have a very limited ability to change their anatomy, but they can control these cues and that is probably a large part of their ability to imitate. </p>
<p>As for animals, research out of my own lab has shown that people can tell different monkeys apart based solely on their calls. Even though they had never heard these individual monkeys before. The thing is, they weren’t confident in their ability: they would say “I have no idea if I’m right,” but lo and behold they would be right more often than chance. So we might actually be better at this than we would think. </p>
<p>As an aside, my lab is in the process of publishing a study showing that listeners can also tell different people apart by their screams alone, even without having met them! This makes sense evolutionarily since if you hear someone scream it would potentially be beneficial to be able to know who it is right off the bat. Monkeys can also tell which monkey is screaming (although researchers have only looked at this with individuals within a social group - we don’t know if monkeys can tell strangers apart). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Concerning animals all sounding alike, you've never had cats. I have two cats, and when one meows, I can tell which one by the sound of her voice. This has occurred with several cats I've had. One may have a meek, mild meow, while the other has a more robust one. </p>
<p>As for human voice artists being able to replicate other peoples voices, it has to do with a lot of internal things. Lowering or raising the larynx a bit, adding in some spit to give a gravely representation. Tongue position, breath control, also play a part. Next is matching the speech patterns of the person you're imitating. Do they talk fast or slow. My first impression was LBJ back when my voice started changing. Slow, deep, and with a southern style accent, he was easy. (this was late 60s, when impressionists like Rich Little were at a peak of popularity) One day, I got in a hurry practicing that and wound up stammering and sounding just like Jimmy Stewart. By the time I started performing, I had about 80 different voices and other sound effects at my disposal, mostly politicians and entertainers. It's not easy to learn, and takes some work. Local dialect plays an important role. Still, it can be learned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People all have unique voices for the same reason fingerprints are different; natural variation. Getting two specimens to grow exactly the same way is pretty difficult, so variations make each voice unique. Nature is replete with this phenomenon, if you cut down a tree and counted the tree rings you could find two trees that were the same age, but the shape of the rings themselves will vary, sometimes drastically. Each snowflake is unique, because as the water freezes different I've crystals form. And human appearance, facial features, etc., are all different as well.</p>
<p>During puberty boys get deeper voices due to the increase of testosterone in their bodies. Testosterone causes the larynx, a cartilage tube, to get bigger, and the vocal chords get thicker and longer, thus changing the pitch. And while women also get deeper voices as they age as well, it's obviously not as much as what boys experience, and it tends to be more gradual.</p>
<p>As far as why people can imitate the voices of others, I think there are a few different things going on there. For one, accent. If a voice impressionist is imitating a famous person they try and match the accent, which varies region to region, as well as change the tone and the pitch, much like if you were singing, to get the right combination. Then there's the cadence. Some people talk in a cadence of sorts, and getting the correct rhythm pattern also goes a ways to sounding like another person. And then there's using catch phrases, or words, or things that the other person uses. If you raise your pitch, talk through your nose a bit, match the cadence, and use the phrase, &quot;did I do that?&quot; People will know you're trying to imitate <a href="https://youtu.be/Ya2xifdO_l0" target="_blank">Steve Urkel</a>.</p>
<p>Also, in the voice imitation business you don't have to sound <em>exactly</em> like another person, often if you get close enough then that's all you need. If you put them side by side, or did more intensive analysis you'd likely find the imitation is rarely exact anyway. You likely wouldn't be able to fool voice print analysis, even with your dead in voice impression. So ultimately the voice is still unique.</p>
<p>For your follow up questions about animals I'm not sure what you mean by animals sounding like people. Most animals don't quite sound just like a human. There are parrots and other birds who can imitate people and other sounds, but they don't always sound exact either. Parrots don't have vocal chords for one thing, they do have a larynx-like structure in their chest called a syrinx, but then they have to use their tongues to finalize the sound they are trying to mimic. </p>
<p>As far as why parrots do this, they try and sound like the rest of their flock, and they will imitate humans who they are around a lot, like they would their flock. They may have also developed this function as a defensive measure against predators to confuse them by using other sounds. The most elaborate mimicry might just be the Lyre Bird, <a href="https://youtu.be/mSB71jNq-yQ" target="_blank">who can mimic a wide range of impressive sounds</a>.</p>
