		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer to this is a combination of a couple things. One item is that some European countries levied heavy taxes against engine displacement, which incentivized consumers to buy smaller displacement engines, which lead car makers to focus on small engines.</p>
<p>In the United States, many automakers made large trucks which used large engines to tow/haul heavy loads. To save money, automakers tried to share some of the components of the truck engines with car engines. These engines also tied in well with the muscle car scene in the USA. You still see some of this today, especially with the big 3 American automakers. </p>
<p>Other factors include emissions regulations, cost of fuel between Europe and the United States, and differences in how the different populations used cars. The United States stretches over a huge area of land with lots of open space between with long sections of freeway. Many European cities are very old and we're constructed long before automobiles were even remotely close to being an idea in someone's head. These small narrow streets make it hard to fit the larger cars that tend to accompany larger engines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our fuel over here is almost twice the price of what it is in the U.S, for a start. <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/221368/gas-prices-around-the-world/" target="_blank">Gasoline price comparison</a></p>
<p>Add the fact our Road Tax (an almighty rip off) is based upon emissions (was once done on engine size), then it’s easy to see why our little 1.6l’s become the norm.</p>
<p>A lot to be said for the size of our countries also. We would rarely have the need to take extremely long drives, where as the sheer scale of the U.S would likely make such road trips more likely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because fuel is considerably cheaper in the US. Also they don’t tax based on engine displacement. Some other countries tax based on engine displacement so they try and keep it as low as possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They think nothing of driving 10 hours at highway speeds.</p>
<p>Bigger engines run at lower RPM at higher speeds. Lower RPM means less wear and better fuel efficiency over the excessive distances and higher speeds they regularly drive.</p>
<p>In large part, most EU driving is in town in traffic where smaller engines are more efficient.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>European people dont use cars like Americans do. We are very self reliant for a lot of things that Europeans dont need to be just because of the distances we travel.</p>
<p>It takes 3 hours to cross Ireland. 3 hours doesnt even get you across most smaller states.</p>
<p>Alot of this applies more in rural areas that europe doesnt have. Being hours away from the nearest city in any given state is much different than most places in europe would ever imagine.</p>
<p>Add to that our fuel isnt taxed out the ass and vehicles arent taxed by engine displacement, it makes a difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
