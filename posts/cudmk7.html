		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not really. 187 years is long compared to a human but still the blink of an eye evolutionary. Even Pando is still more or less identical to modern day aspens although mostly inconsequential mutations were used in part to estimate its age. It's possible we'd see differences in Pando if it flowered, but AFAIK it's been ten thousand years since that happened. In some ~32,000 year old seeds from the Arctic the flowers that grew from them had slightly longer petals, but that could also be a regional thing where some now extinct populations had longer petals than most of the others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like nobody is actually answering the question here.</p>
<p>The answer is: it depends. Sometimes, a noticeable mutation can occur over a single generation. Sometimes, there might actually be quite a few generations between those two specimens.</p>
<p>In case of trees, it's quite possible that a tree can &quot;see&quot; the birth of its great times n grandchildren. If that's the case, some significant differences <em>can</em> occur.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Evolution doesn't necessarily work over time, but over several generations of a species. The absolute time doesn't matter but how many generations could occur in that time. This is why we can see evolutionary changes in things like bacteria on the scales of weeks to months.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I get the thought behind it - but species with very long lived individuals and very long reproductive lives tend to be very slow in reproducing.</p>
<p>If there was an example of a species capable of living 80,000 years (Pando) while still banging out non-clonal offspring every year then we'd absolutely be able to see evolutionary differences between an 80,000 year old individual and one 80,000 generations younger. (Assuming environmental pressures exist etc etc).</p>
<p>But there isn't one.</p>
<p>That's more than enough time to go from wolves to pugs (domestic dogs as an example took 20k to 40k years. So 10k-20k generations?) - I'd even argue it's likely that 80k generations later the descendents are <em>likely</em> to have speciated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
