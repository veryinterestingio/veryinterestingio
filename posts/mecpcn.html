		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe! Probably not. But maybe!</p>
<p>People have hypothesized about variable speed of light (VSL) theories for a long time - Einstein was one of the early people to work on them. The basic idea is, like you said, &quot;what <em>if</em> the speed of light is changing with cosmic time, how would we know?&quot; </p>
<p>It turns out that this is more than just a wacky guess; a VSL could solve some open problems in physics. For example, cosmic inflation in the very early universe is something of a mystery - it seems to work really well at explaining observations (for example, that very distant things in the universe appear to have been causally connected very early). But, we don't have a mechanism for it. If instead of having the universe expand really really quickly at early times we allow light to be much faster than it is today, then you might be able to solve this 'horizon' problem (of causal connectivity).</p>
<p>That's really speculative though because lots of things in the distant universe look 'right,' meaning, 'how we expect them to look given a constant speed of light.' So while a VSL may solve one problem, it would probably break a lot of other physics which I won't go into. </p>
<p>My point is that yes, you could construct theories with a variable speed of light and people have done that. Whether <em>our</em> universe has a variable speed of light is an open question, and observations would suggest that it doesn't (within measurement uncertainty), even if it's a tempting hack to fix a few things. </p>
<p>Even if VSL theories aren't right, that doesn't stop them from being fun to think about. I'm a theorist by training, and we have a well known joke which might be relevant - &quot;Never let data get in the way of a good theory.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer: Yes, but no.</p>
<p>The longer answer: the Einstein field equations (EFEs) require that G/c^2 is constant.  Thus, if both G and c vary over time in a way that this G/c^2 ratio remains constant, then there is no violation of the EFEs and all is good.  In fact, this has been explored in the literature by Albrecht, Barrow, Magueijo, and others.  (I can dig up references for anyone curious to read more.)</p>
<p>These variable speed of light (VSL) cosmologies solve some cosmological problems quite elegantly, like cosmic inflation.  Rather than some special physics that rapidly increased the size of space, light moved faster at that time to allow an exchange of information (temperature) between regions of the universe that, today, look like they have previously never been in contact.</p>
<p>The main problem with VSL theories is that it breaks some fundamental relationships.  For one, there is now a &quot;preferred&quot; reference frame with which to view the universe.  Right now, we operate under the assumption that all reference frames are equal, called Lorentz invariance (and other similar names).  Without getting into details, breaking that assumption makes things a lot more difficult when it comes to forming a cosmological model of the universe.  The next important relationship that gets screwy is related to the fine structure constant, which is e^2 /(hc), where h is the reduced Planck's constant.  Varying that with time is...well, it is incredibly hard to allow that and make it fit what we can observe to be true.  Barrow &amp; Magueijo (1999) talks about that in more detail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few scholars have posited VSL as a resolution to the current 'cosmological crisis': measurements of the Hubble Constant using data from the cosmic microwave background (the leftover radiation of the early universe) do not jive with redshift measurements using the 'standard candle' process (and other processes). This is evidently a big deal, because each way of measuring is scientifically very sound (according to current physics models).  The Hubble Constant is the rate of expansion of the universe, so it is crucial for determining the age and fate of the cosmos.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
