		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While you can get viruses in several ways from emails, phishing typically refers to information gathering. Usually given willingly by the target. Examples: An email that appears to be from your grandma asking you to remind her of her account password, or an email from your bank that says to click this link and reset your password. The link takes you to a &quot;safe&quot; page that looks just like your banks website asking you to enter your current password to change the password. Except it's just a good copy of the website with a similar link address. No viruses involved. Just trying to get you to give up the info.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The email is the bait, it will usually be a notification about an account issue. The link is the hook and even if you click on it, nothing should happen, unless of course you allow your browser to run iffy scripts or plug-ins. But if you put your account information in and click send, you essentially gulped down the hook, since your information was now transferred to the people phishing for it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There have been exploits from time to time that allow remote code execution just by opening the email, <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-and-threats/outlook-users-face-zero-day-attack/d/d-id/1127891" target="_blank">especially for microsoft outlook.</a></p>
<p>However this is pretty rare. 99.999% of spam emails are hoping to trick you into clicking a link. In fact, clicking a link isn't usually enough by itself either, unless there is a zero-day exploit in your web browser at the monent. They also need you to enter your credentials at that link, or download and run a file.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5 version: Phishing is getting information by pretending to be someone real. Say me pretending to be Google. if I get you to believe I'm Google you may try using your real credentials (username and password) when I show you a fake login page.</p>
<p>Other methods of attack may be able to infect your device by just opening an email but it's not very likely these days. So much so that I wouldn't worry about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>College version:</p>
<p>It's already been alluded to in some other comments but phishing pretty strictly refers to gathering sensitive information via impersonating something/someone legitimate or seemingly legitimate. So, something like getting a fake email saying they are Google and you need to sign in after clicking a link. People calling you pretending to be the IRS are in a similar category though many consider phishing to be online only. With that in mind, phishing can only be accomplished if you provide information willingly. It can't be accomplished by just viewing an email or a page on a web.</p>
<p>That said, phishing isn't the only form of attack. Social engineering is when you provide seemingly harmless information willingly that is then used to gain access to your accounts: email, bank, credit cards, computer logon, etc. This information is typically used to answer security questions though can sometimes be used to guess passwords, if you have weak passwords. Supposedly this is one of the more successful methods of infiltrating computer security these days. If you're able to get someone's login information it's difficult to tell when an illegitimate party has gained entry.  </p>
<p>Malware in general: ransomware, viruses, keyloggers, etc can be transmitted via email. Most of the time this still requires going to a website and/or downloading something. However, there are, or at least have been, ways to get infected by just viewing an email. This is one reason why most email clients don't auto-download, run, or otherwise display attachments anymore. To prevent attack vectors. Things that display in an email: pictures and anything that HTML can do could potentially cause you to be automatically infected. However, this is unlikely. It requires flaws in how the pictures and HTML work and those flaws have to allow you to gain access to things you shouldn't have access to. On top of that those flaws can get patched. It's like playing whack-a-mole. For an average person it's far better to trick them into downloading things that have malware instead because trying to figure out if a program is malware or not is tricky. Anti-virus software is far from perfect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
