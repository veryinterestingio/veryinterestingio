		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pacing is a physical manifestation of our thought processes. By moving at a constant step, it acts as a tempo to step from one thought to another and to loop back around if we reach a dead end. The same thing occurs when we are thinking and bob our heads back and forth, gesture with our hands, or look to different places with our eyes. You may notice people performing these actions while talking on the phone even if the other side can't see them.</p>
<p>Pacing also is good for your body. Sitting tends to cause your blood to pool in your legs so walking will help circulate that blood around. It also acts like exercise to release hormones that counteract feelings of anxiety.</p>
<p>EDIT: For more information about the psychology aspect, take a look at <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/a-brief-guide-to-embodied-cognition-why-you-are-not-your-brain/" target="_blank">Embodied Cognition</a>. Embodied Cognition suggests that your body and mind's states are linked such that one can influence the other. Thanks to /u/bokan for identifying this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ability to concentrate is still only partially understood by cognitive psychologists.</p>
<p>One way of thinking about (model) of attention/concentration is that you have different &quot;pools&quot; for different tasks/senses.</p>
<p>For example, doodling while in class helps some people concentrate, because while the auditory-linguistic part of their attention is activated (hopefully) by the teacher, the tactical-movement and sometimes visual attention (if the teacher isn't very visually engaging) is bored and looking for something to do, drawing your attention away from the subject at hand. That's why when you give yourself something to occupy the part that's &quot;bored&quot; it can shut up and let you properly concentrate.</p>
<p>Same with phone conversations for some people. The auditory-linguistic-social parts are engaged, but your body-movement parts (or for me, the visual parts) are itching for something to do.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You've probably heard that [some large percentage] of human communication is nonverbal.</p>
<p>It's kind of a bullshit number, but the gist of it is true. When we interact, we are very animated and use a lot of expressions and body language to communicate. However, when you're on a phone, you're limited to just a limited-bandwidth voiceline with nothing else.</p>
<p>So, when talking to someone on the phone, you tend to compensate the significantly constrained method of communication by gesturing more yourself, which includes pacing around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This relates your arousal level to your performance at a task. Some monotonic tasks, like factory work or boring highway driving, are performed better with higher levels of arousal. Other complex or novel tasks, like solving a math problem or studying a map, are performed better with lower arousal.</p>
<p>This is why we turn down the radio to better read street signs, or why increasing your arousal by pacing may help you focus on a phone call.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
