I'm aware that if you were to approach a black hole, your speed relative to someone watching from afar would increase greatly, thus your time from their perspective would appear to slow down until you reach the event horizon, where you would freeze in place for eternity. In this sense, as your personal time is moving so much slower than all of that around you, would you not see the future of the universe unravel before you, just as you cross the event horizon?</p></div></div>

<ul>
<li>The premise is wrong. No one will see you stopping forever. This is a purely mathematical result. Yes, the intensity of light you expect far away will never reach exactly zero. But it will quickly become ridiculously low (&lt;10^-10^100 ). You will quickly receive the last photon ever, afterwards the object has fallen in for all practical purposes.</li>
<li>If you fall in freely, it won't look that special. The dark region will occupy more and more of your field of vision, all the light appears to come from smaller and smaller regions of space as you fall in. Time dilation approaches a factor of just 2 (and you need to be inside to get close to that), and if I remember correctly it is redshifted, not blueshifted: You see <em>less</em> than you would outside.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the outside people will see you slow down as you fall towards the black hole - but that also applies to the light behind you, and it is mainly something special about the outside view. For people falling into a black hole it is way less special than for people watching it from the outside.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>But if time stops at the event horizon how does anything happen there? Wouldn't you just get infinitely closer to the event horizon without ever actually crossing it? Time would slow down for you to the point where you're basically frozen in space (but you wouldn't notice). You would get infinitely close to the event horizon but you would never be able to cross it. Can someone please explain to me why this is incorrect because this is what makes sense to me yet everyone keeps saying that objects can pass through the event horizon?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not to highjack the thread but with black hole people here, Im curious about a thought Ive had regarding black holes. Einstien says that light cannot escape a black hole due to gravity holding it back but couldn't the light emission problem be a time problem, not a weight / gravity problem? Speed of light is a distance over time equation and if time is dialated so aggressively at the event horizon then maybe black holes are emitting light but just at such a slow rate that we have not existed long enough for it to reach us yet? (Similar to the visible universe horizon)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit: Read the last paragraph first, that's the one I feel is more well grounded in my understanding of the situation, and in a way answers the question you're asking. But I'll leave the rest of the post as well, because I think it's worth mentioning all the same</p>
<p>========</p>
<p><strong>NB:</strong> I've been out of this area for a while so please understand this is my best recollection, and may have since been superceded by other research.</p>
<p>I think an important and oft-overlooked part of the conversation is 'spaghettification.' We know that as you approach a black hole, tidal forces overcome the bonds that hold materials together and tear it into a long thin strand of particles.* We often pretend that we can ignore this issue and ask 'what it would look like if...'. But I'd like to propose that it's not as negligible as all that. As such, we can't properly talk about what an 'observer' would see, but really only how particles will behave in the system.</p>
<p>What we can say is that, suppose the particles entering have a half-life of 1 second. Very nearby particles, in roughly the same area of space-time will decay at similar rates so using that as a kind of clock, 'locally' time still passes at a rate of 1 second per second. But an outside observer would detect the radiation from the decay (if they were properly equipped) at increasingly long intervals of time, and with decreasing energy over time. Eventually those particles collide with other particles and so on 'falling in.' Over very long time scales, Hawking radiation means particles slowly leak out of the black hole. So, eventually some particle or particles leave the black hole that have interacted with the 'information' of the particles falling into the black hole.</p>
<p>Now, if there were a way to properly attach a clock to a particle besides something like decay (which messes with the above description of course), then we might be able to say the following. Suppose we have two particles with such clocks attached, and the clock can be 'handed off' to other particles in collisions. One particle falls into the black hole and the other orbits outside of it permanently. After some time, a particle will leave the black hole with the clock carried in by the falling particle. If you were to compare the times on both clocks, the clock exiting the black hole will have a much shorter time elapsed than the one orbiting the black hole.</p>
<p>What would the falling in particle 'see'? Well let's add a third body to our problem. Let's suppose I have a radio transmitter in orbit near the other orbiting particle. That transmitter emits one radio photon every second. The infalling particle (let's pretend that we magically aim our transmitter in the right direction to always 'hit' the falling particle) would see those radio photons get higher and higher energy and come more and more frequently. So, <em>in a sense</em>, it is 'seeing the future of the universe' insofar as it is absorbing light from 'outside' events at shorter and shorter timescales. We don't even need a black hole to test this hypothesis. Any massive body will do. The GPS receiver you have on the ground on earth receives photons at higher energies and at slightly higher rates than the GPS satellites are emitting them. This is, of course, corrected for in all the maths that happen within GPS calculations.</p>
<p>*: Ed: For sufficiently large black holes, tidal forces would not tear you apart before you fall into the black hole. Though I would still argue that at some point in the interior you're either going to experience tidal forces so great, or you'll be blasted by such increasingly intense infalling radiation that my long term description of the future as just a bunch of particles colliding around I believe would still hold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
