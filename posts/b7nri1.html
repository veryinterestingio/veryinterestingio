		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our brain is constantly receiving input from dozens of senses. We can't pay attention to all of these signals - we don't have enough bandwidth - so we prioritise certain inputs over others. The brain acts as a gatekeeper: it decides which sensory inputs are important (and so should be attended/paid attention to) and which inputs can be disregarded. </p>
<p>Have you ever been <em>really</em> into a computer game and not noticed that you were hungry? Your brain is prioritising the visual and auditory (and maybe tactile) input from the game, and suppressing the input from your neglected/abused stomach. This kinda thing happens all the time, in many situations. </p>
<p>The same principle applies here. The brain has decided that, for whatever reason, it doesn't really care about the pain signals. However, when you look at the wound, you're bringing it into what we call conscious awareness. You're paying attention to the wound, which encourages the brain to prioritise the inputs associated with the wound. </p>
<p>Bit of a sidenote, but this is related to why rubbing an owie will reduce the pain. You're overwhelming the pain signals with &quot;rubbing&quot; signals from the same area. The brain doesn't have the bandwidth to process both sources, so it'll reduce the salience (importance) of the pain signals, in order to accommodate and process the tactile (rubbing) signals. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pain is weird.  You can have a lot of pain and little tissue damage (paper cut) or no tissue damage.  And you can have no pain and a lot of tissue damage (veterans finding out they have bullets stuck in their head from decades ago).  (This applies to MRI and x ray findings as well but a lot of patients insist on getting imaging with non traumatic pain). Pain and tissue damage are related but don't have a one to one correlation.  Think about pain as the body's alarm system.   If it deems you are in danger, it'll make you feel pain to address it.   If it's safe, you won't feel pain.   Sometimes you get small little cuts or bruises that you've had previously as well.  Your nervous system remembers these weren't that big a deal and won't address it because it's not really that much of a danger to your well being.  Or if at war time you're getting shot at, it is more important to get yourself to safety than to make you feel agonizing pain over a bullet wound.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
