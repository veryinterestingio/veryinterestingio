		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body is like a combustion engine, constantly producing heat, and you need to dissipate that in order to keep it working properly. If you are losing too much heat you feel cold, lose too little and you feel hot.</p>
<p>The amount of heat you dissipate through your skin depends on 2 factors, the thermal conductivity and the temperature of the material you are touching. That's why air feels comfortable at around 21°C but water or a piece of metal at the same temperature will feel cold, as they will &quot;suck&quot; more heat from your body due to their higher thermal conductivity.</p>
<p>So what you are feeling is not exactly temperature, it's heat loss. And your body is very sensitive to it because your internal &quot;machinery&quot; needs to be at a very specific temperature to work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your cells express receptors from the TRP family. These receptors are proteins which sit on the outside of nerve cells, and when they're activated they start a signal which is relayed to your brain to cause a sensation. Lots of receptors work by recognising a very specific molecule. This will bind to them (through specific combinations of electrostatic charges on the molecule and on the receptor), causing the receptor to change its shape to the 'active' configuration, allowing ions to move through and cause the signal (think of a lock and key, where the lock is a receptor in your taste bud, the key is salt, and the door opening is you getting the salty flavour).</p>
<p>Some of these TRPpy bois are a bit different from 'regular' receptors. Rather than recognising specific molecules, they are sensitive to temperatures. At 30 degrees they'll be closed, but maybe at 40 degree the temperature will be high enough to overcome some of the electrostatic attractions within the receptor itself, changing its shape to 'open' and causing a signal. Your body encodes tonnes of these receptors and they're all sensitive to slightly different temperatures. Some are linked to cells which let you detect temperature, and some are linked to nerves which make you go 'oh fuck that's hot ow', and some link straight into your reflex to withdraw your body from the heat because it's hot enough to damage you.</p>
<p>As for the why - evolution. Organisms which could tell dangerous and safe temperatures apart didn't die and reproduced, and then it got really complicated over time, then here we are.</p>
<p>Fun fact - chillies contain capsaicin. Rather than activating your 'ow fuck that's hot' receptors, they actually bind to them and slightly change the shape, not quite opening them but making them more susceptible to lower temperatures. That's actually why we feel the heat - it's not that the chillies are that temperature.</p>
<p>I realise this ain't ELI5 very well but I'm a scientist not a teacher. Sorry all. For further reading this is the first thing I found on Google. Enjoy - <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29135465/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29135465/</a></p>
<p>Also I realise I'm the only one not talking about thermodynamics and why different materials feel different. But I love this shit and wanted to feel included OKAY</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing I haven't seen posted which should be mentioned is that men and women feel temperature differently.</p>
<p>tl;dr, there are a bunch of reasons men both feel and run hotter, whereas women are typically colder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Women are typically smaller and have a higher ratio of surface area to volume, which causes a rapid loss of heat.</p>
<p>Men tend to have a greater muscle mass than women which helps them to generate heat.</p>
<p>Even at rest, your muscles produce around 25% of your body's normal temperature, so more muscle mass means a greater heat production. Because of this, it is believed that women evolved a system to protect their core body temperature against freezing weather - in response to cold surroundings a woman's body reduces blood flow to the skin and extremities to maintain their core temperature at 37C. This means that women are better than men at conserving core body heat when the weather cools.</p>
<p>However, as most of our temperature sensors are located in the skin, women can feel cold even when their internal organs are cosy. So it's not all in your imagination. It seems that women really are genetically programmed to feel drops in temperature before their male counterparts. The ideal temperature appears to be around 2.5C warmer than men - between 24C and 25C.</p>

<p>You'll probably see this if you're ever in an office environment with many people. Women will be wearing sweaters or mention it's cold whereas men will feel it's comfortable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We notice temperature changes because our nervous system instantly reacts to regulate the core temperature of our bodies.
We have an average baseline temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, which is caused by the basic functioning our bodies organs (contracting muscles, electrical properties of nerves, etc.) The optimal external temperature for humans is roughly 70F. When it’s 70+ the body cannot properly disperse heat, so it works harder to cool itself and therefor makes us feel even hotter. Then, the farther below 70 we go, the harder the body will work to keep itself warm because our tissues are being slowed down by the cold.
Temperature changes could mean life or death in the wild so it’s very noticeable when these changes occur to help us jump into fight or flight mode. I don’t think I could notice a temp difference less than 3 degrees, but some people might be more sensitive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
