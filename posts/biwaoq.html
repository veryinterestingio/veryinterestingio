It is also a cultural heritage site which means it's important to history and protected by many rules and laws.  Any plan to rebuild should be reviewed  and approved by the pertinent authorities and the people of France.</p>
<p>The Burj Khalifa on the other hand was a completely new building who's construction was controlled by fewer people who could more or less build it however they wanted because they had less rules/laws to adhere to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>That's also not taking into account the fact Notre Dame is a historical building, and those are always a massive bureaucratic nightmare</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Architect here. </p>
<p>Historical restoration is difficult for several reasons. I'll list a few below. These are just examples BTW. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Same or similar materials have to be used. You can't use cement mortar if the building originally used lime mortar. You can't use steel truss if the original used wooden truss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even the type of wood and stone has to be original. If they used cedar, you can't use teak. If they used marble from South Italy, you can't use marble from Greece.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We do not have structural drawings from the original construction. If, say, the Burj suffered fire damage.... We have the structural drawings, the architectural drawings and all other HVAC, MEP, Fire drawings. We can safely modify, repair and build on top of it. We have the math and physics sorted. We don't have that for old buildings. The plans of Notre Dame are actually more of measure drawings and don't really give you structural details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The finesse in carvings, paintings, stone inlay etc has to be done by hand, by highly skilled workers, for authenticity. That takes time and money. Lots of it. They even have to match the pigments, the brush strokes and the styles of art.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They still have to incorporate modern lighting, fire safety rules and follow construction bylaws.</p>
</li>
<li>The architects and historians working on this are some of the best in the world. They are not easily available. They also take time to do things very perfect.</li>
</ol>
<p>7: They have to follow the historical plans to utmost perfection, and details are not always available. So they must also research, that takes time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Restoring a historical building is very difficult. You have to be very careful to be sure you don't damage anything, and if you're doing a faithful restoration you need to source both supplies and workmen that may no longer be commonly available.</p>
<p>Companies that can knock out a skyscraper are a dime a dozen, but there's only a handful of people in the world who can design and build a wooden cathedral roof.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They could knock together a roof and have it on in a matter of a few weeks, but they're trying to restore the roof back to how it was, and that involves building techniques and materials which are very rare today. In addition, restoration of a building which was damaged includes a lot of work to ensure that you don't accidentally damage something else in the process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
