		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello AskScience! We are paleontologists who study crocodylians and their extinct relatives. While people often talk about crocodylians as living fossils, their evolutionary history is quite complex. Their morphology has varied substantially over time, in ways you may not expect. </p>
<p>We recently published a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-36795-1" target="_blank">paper looking at habitat shifts across Crocodylomorpha</a>, the larger group that includes crocodylians and their extinct relatives. We found that shifts in habitat, such as from land to freshwater, happened multiple times in the evolution of the group. They shifted from land to freshwater three times, and between freshwater and marine habitats at least nine times. There have even been two shifts from aquatic habitats to land! Our study paints a complex picture of the evolution of a diverse group.</p>

<p>If you have time to answer, I have three questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>You mention that, contrary to common wisdom, crocodylian morphology has varied substantially over time in unexpected ways. What are the most interesting (to each of you) ways this has happened, and where can we read more about it?</li>
<li>If you could correct one common myth about your field you see repeated in public discussions (other than the &quot;crocodylians are living fossils&quot; thing), what would it be?</li>
<li>What is it about vertebrate paleontology that brought you to the field in the first place?</li>

<p>I recently learned that alligators can handle short bouts of freezing temperatures as long as they can breathe. </p>

<p>How were they able to survive prolonged periods of freezing temperatures (ice ages)?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because of the recent polar vortex there have been super interesting reports of crocs hibernating, frozen in ice, with their snouts sticking out to breath.</p>
<p>I assume this is an evolutionary behavior to deal with the cold but...why didn't crocs just migrate to warmer climates? Where were these crocs living that it got cold so often that they had to develop this trait? Is this something that crocs do because of ancestral behavior or is it something they developed?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What, if anything, is the relationship between the crocodylians and cetaceans?   It would seem that marine crocodylians would be in direct competition with evolving cetaceans, along with other marine carnivores.</p>
<p>Freshwater crocodylians may have had less direct competition.</p>
<p>Edit:  Not implying a genetic relationship.  More a comparison of the history of them when they are competing in the same niche.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>What could we expect from these guys (in the short term) with rising seas and ?  We have a healthy population of Alligators in eastern North Carolina,  and I can imagine their territory greatly expanded...especially further up our lazy waterways. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
