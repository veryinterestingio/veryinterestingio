		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that you have to convince people of that 'restored it to new condition'. While it's not impossible they could do that, it's also really common that cars in an accident are never the same no matter how much work you do. So people don't want to buy them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked in the auto industry and I look at it as the car is not “new condition”. From the factory the cars are built all 100% exactly the same with the same exact bolts, parts, brands, etc that have passed engineering tests. A shop doing a rebuild may use XYZ brand when the factory built it using ABC brand. Little things like this add up. Maybe the door closes a little stiff now? Well after lots of use that may cause the door hinge paint to crack, leading to rust, leading to door hinge failure. Maybe the suspension components are slightly bent- causing tires to wear faster, suspension parts to wear out in half the time? Lots of things can appear very minor but add up over time for vehicles in accidents</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have two cars that you're looking at buying. Both are the same make model and year, same color, same features, same mileage, both same driving and maintenance habits, and both appear to be completely free of any cosmetic or functional defects.</p>
<p>One has been in an accident, the other has not. Which one would you choose?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is absolutely impossible to restore a car to factory original condition. Car manufacturers spend 100's of millions on computer and robotic paint systems. Autobody repairers will get it good enough to satisfy customers but most customers aren't knowledgeable enough about the repair process to be unsatisfied.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every part of a car is affected in an accident.  A front end collision that only damages the front, right?  Maybe.  The entire frame can be tweaked slightly.  Interior trim can be knocked loose and start rattling 50,000 miles early.  The mechanicals within climate controls can be tweaked and fail prematurely.  The windows, when rolling up, will chafe a bit more and wear the motors faster.  The door seals will have a harder time sealing as they age.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the act of replacing components, many mechanics cut corners, leave out forgotten fasteners, electrical ties to prevent vibration, etc.  Almost never is a car reassembled as well as it was from the factory.</p>
<p>Strange and mysterious gremlins tend to pop up all over in a car that has been in a wreck.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
