		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sort of but not quite. The job description of a body guard is to protect their client. This may include putting yourself into a dangerous position where you might get killed although it is preferable if nobody gets killed. Nobody would ever expect that a bodyguard is required to get himself shot if the client is shot at. But that is something which might happen while he is trying to protect his client instead of running away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one is so fast that they can see a bullet coming and step in front of it. Bodyguards stand in front of their client and act as a wall or shield. An assassin who wishes to shoot the client can't get a clear shot. In most instances this means that they don't take the shot. Killing or wounding a bodyguard doesn't really help. The other bodyguards will swarm and cover the client and get them into cover. </p>
<p>Bodyguards put themselves in the line of fire in a general sense. They may and sometimes do get shot by accident because they are standing next to someone who is a target. They don't jump or dive in front of a bullet like in the movies. They are already standing in front of or next to the target usually. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the coolest interactions was a member of Reagans Secret Service Agents, (Timothy McCarthy) who made himself a larger target to protect the former POTUS, obviously it was against his natural instinct but he did it out of muscle memory to make himself a bigger target when to sound of shots rang out. </p>
<p>Going a bit off track here but this is also why Presidents often have large covers over the entrances and motorcades they get in to avoid these easy lines of sight on targets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a friend who was (might still be, I dunno) a body guard for a very wealthy client.</p>
<p>He said based on the client's wishes, he was more PA than body guard.</p>
<p>I think part of the client hated the idea of just paying somebody to follow him around, so he'd make him do stuff not related to his actual &quot;job&quot;.</p>
<p>If I were a betting man, Is say he existed to lower insurance rates, not actually do anything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
