		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's largely because of a man named John Harvey Kellogg. Yes, the inventor of modern breakfast cereal and founder of Kellogg's, one of the largest breakfast cereal and dry foods companies. He was a real psychopath, religious nutcase, doctor, and anti-masturbation crusader. He believed that masturbation and sex were evil, and that circumcision would reduce pleasure and thus stop boys from masturbating. He used his position as a doctor to spread the idea that circumcision was the cure for just about everything, from syphilis to poor grades in school, and that it was more hygienic. His ideas caught on among other doctors and the practice spread over the generations, eventually becoming so customary that it became normal, and parents just do it to their sons now without even thinking about it. He also pushed for girls to have carbolic acid poured on their clitorises, but thankfully that never caught on.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Oh, and he was also a huge racist and segregationist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Circumcision was popularized in the US in large part by Kellogg, of cereal fame. He was a very well respected health advocate, and pushed circumcision as a method to prevent masturbation, which he believed caused insanity. He convinced many orphanages to perform forced circumcision on male and female children. He performed many surgeries himself because he was apparently a sadist.</p>
