		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Short answer:</strong> About once every 90 minutes or so.</p>
<p><strong>Long answer:</strong> Surface gravity of a spherically symmetric body is GM/R^2 - where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass, and R is the radius. This, specifically, is an acceleration. Earth surface gravity is about 9.8 m/s^(2). If you've never taken a physics class before those units might seem weird. The 'per seconds squared' means that if you drop something and allow it to accelerate under gravity then its speed will increase by 9.8 m/s per second, hence m/s^(2). </p>
<p>Anyway, if you spin any chunk of matter fast enough it will fling itself apart. This is due to the centrifugal force. Yes, I do mean centrifugal and not centripetal. The centrifugal force is the apparent 'outward and away' force that spinning things feel, due to that objects inertia wanting it to move in a straight line. It's why a <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/fUjsDMaws2QyWxDjJs/giphy.gif" target="_blank">dancer's dress seems to float when they spin</a>, and why you feel yourself pressed against the car door when you go around a turn. </p>
<p>Anyway, we can make a quick approximation. The centrifugal force is equal to to R*w^(2), where w is the rotational rate of the object (in radians per second). Faster rotation makes for a greater centrifugal force. In practice, this will also cause the earth to become more ellipsoidal and bulge at the equator, changing our effective surface gravity, but we're just ballparking it here. </p>
<p>Putting these two numbers together, how fast does the earth have to spin for the centrifugal force to be equal to the force of gravity at the equator? This estimate gives us a rotational period of about <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2*pi%2F+sqrt%289.8+m%2Fs%5E2+++%2F+%28radius+of+earth%29%29" target="_blank">5000 seconds, or about 90 minutes.</a> Try to spin the earth any faster and it will shed mass from the equator!</p>
<p>In fact, this part of the reason that observations of fast pulsars is important for astrophysics! The fastest pulsars we observe tell us how great their surface gravity must be (and what mechanisms might be slowing down their rotation), which tells us how compact they might be!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>TL;DR</strong> once per hour if you want things to fly off and not come back</p>
<p>Another way of looking at this is in terms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity" target="_blank">escape velocity</a>, the speed required to escape a body's gravity with no further thrust. For Earth, this is about 11.2km/s, so if something at the surface is moving that fast (and not <em>towards</em> the surface!) it will fly off.</p>
<p>If the rotational period is <em>P</em> seconds, an object at the equator is moving at <em>π×2×r/P</em> km/s where <em>r</em> is the radius of the Earth in kilometres. Set this equal to 11.2 km/s and <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=pi+*+2+*+radius+of+earth+%2F+escape+velocity+of+earth" target="_blank">solve for <em>P</em></a> and you get just under one hour for the rotational period.</p>
<p>The reason this answer is different from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ef1ip0/how_fast_would_the_earth_have_to_spin_in_order/fbxx15k/" target="_blank">current top-voted one</a> is because of a difference in interpretation: they have taken &quot;fly off into space&quot; to mean &quot;at least orbit just above the ground&quot;. I have taken it to mean &quot;fly off and never come back&quot;.</p>
<p>For rotational speeds in between once per 90 minutes and once per hour, an object at the surface would be flung off, but then come back in an orbit which, as the speed got larger and larger, would get more and more eccentric (stretched), until at once per hour, it would be &quot;infinitely stretched&quot; and not come back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If thing were flying off to space, gravity wouldn't be able to provide enough centripetal acceleration to make it just spin around the earth with 0 weight:</p>
<p>Fc = 9.8
V^2 / r = 9.8
V^2 / 6378100 = 9.8
V = 7906 m/s</p>
<p>So the tangential velocity of the earth would have to spin faster than 7906m/s</p>
<p>= 0.001240 rad/s</p>
<p>= 0.01138 rotations per minute</p>
<p>= 17 rotations per 24 hours</p>
<p>So the earth would need to spin about 17 times faster than it currently does for everything to start floating off the surface and flying off into space.</p>
<p>EDIT: this only applies at the equator. Anywhere else, the velocity decreases, and the direction of the velocity isn't tangential (in the sense that the displacement path doesn't have its centre at the centre of the earth) to earth's gravity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
