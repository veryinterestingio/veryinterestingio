		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's broadly categorized as <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormal_posturing" target="_blank">Abnormal Posturing</a> and is a hallmark of a severe brain injury. It happens because the brain has suffered, or is currently suffering, trauma to its motor control centers that has disabled muscle control in only one set of muscles, while sparing the opposing set. </p>
<p>Our muscles can only contract in one direction- so pretty much every major muscle we have has an antagonist that pulls the other direction. Think biceps and triceps. </p>
<p>Even when we're not consciously flexing them, most muscle pairs are in a state of passive, opposed flexion to maintain stability of the limb.
Different muscle sets are controlled by different spinal nerves receiving signals from the brain- that way we can control them individually. So a command to flex the biceps is going to originate from and travel via a different set of nerves than a command destined for the triceps. </p>
<p>When abnormal posturing occurs, it's because one or more of those major spinal tracts is being completely disrupted, shutting down commands to the muscle groups it controls, leaving their antagonist muscles to flex unopposed- giving you the characteristic posturing as the limbs are forcefully flexed or extended. There are different varieties of abnormal posturing that indicate where in the brain the damage is occurring, and what major muscle groups are being inhibited.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One way to think about it is that a normally functioning brain plays a major role in quieting the constant flow of signals into the brain, as well as out of the brain. When you shut the brain down, you're turning off the inhibition or &quot;QUIET YOU GUYS!&quot;. As a result, everything gets abnormally excited. </p>
<p>Broadly speaking, this can explain abnormal jerking movements or 'posturing' (drawing hands up like T Rex, or &quot;Decorticate posturing) that can be seen in different brain injuries - temporary or permanent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
