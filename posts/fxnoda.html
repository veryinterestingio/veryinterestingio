		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The honest truth is, no one is sure exactly how this works. However, the theory that is most convincing  to me is this:</p>
<p>Muscle fibres are generally used to tensing and relaxing in response to demand. However when they are forced to tense for long periods of time, like for example when you sit in the same position for a long time, the muscle basically forgets to relax, and just stays tense. This is called tetanus (which is NOT the same as the disease, though the disease does cause terrible muscle cramping).</p>
<p>Massage provides an alternative mechanical stimulus into the muscle fibres to trigger a change. Now things are moving around, the fibres in the knot are being stretched, other muscle fibres are being stretched, maybe there is pain. This will increase blood flow, it will move fluid from the tissues into the lymph, and generally change the situation such that the body has to pay attention and do something. So the muscle fibres being massaged and the surrounding tissue will respond in some way, ideally by resetting themselves into relaxing. But if you've ever had a very very hard massage, you know it's possible for the massage to create knots this way too, or leave some muscles relaxed and others still in tension.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had it explained that your proprioreceptors (in this case muscle spindle fibers) have the ability to set themselves in a spot where its comfortable. So people at desk jobs that sit with rotated shoulders and forward head postures have muscles in the front of their body (pecs, anterior neck muscles) that have set themselves in shortened positions. Generally direct pressure on those knots can help reset the proprioreceptor. </p>
<p>Fun fact - Alot of the time its not the shortened mucles that hurts, its the lengthened muscles. So if i have really bad forward rotated shoulders my pecs are whats tight, but my upper back is whats going to be hurting. In this case you cant rub out a lengthened muscle. You need proper exercise to get those back muscles working and you need to stretch those pecs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm friends with someone who teaches gross anatomy. He recently did a lesson on muscle knots. When you dissect a cadaver and look at their back muscles, you won't see any knots even if the person complained of them when they were alive. They aren't sure why that is, except that maybe they dissipate after death. No one really knows why we get muscle knots. He says that in all of the cadaver dissections he's done and all the muscles he's observed, he's never seen a cadaver with a muscle knot even though we know they exist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A knot is nothing more than a part of your muscle contracting really tightly. That part of the muscle contracts making it shorter and thinker and this in turn means the rest of the muscle gets stretched out. Hence why a knot will most of the time result in muscle ache on a different spot as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
