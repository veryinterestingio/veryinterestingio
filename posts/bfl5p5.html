		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While simulations of solar system formation show that &quot;rogue planets&quot; kicked out from their star are highly likely, you're asking about planet-sized bodies formed in isolation with no nearby star system.</p>
<p>The best answer is &quot;we don't know.&quot;</p>
<p>These &quot;born free&quot; planets would be almost impossible to observe, and almost impossible to distinguish from ejected rogue planets.  There is as yet no evidence that they exist.  However, star formation produces <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_mass_function" target="_blank">more small stars than big stars</a>, and small stars are very common right down the the smallest ones we can observe.  It's reasonable to speculate that that trend might continue down to planet-sized objects.  So there's no reason to think they <em>don't</em> exist, either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes! In fact we already know of one, <a href="http://scienceblogs.de/astrodicticum-simplex/tag/cfbdsirj2149/" target="_blank">CFBDSIRJ2149</a>, which is the nearest free-floating planet that we know of. It's gargantuan, estimated to be four to seven times the size of Jupiter, and it's located about one hundred light years away from us.</p>
<p>That's the nearest one that we know of, so they certainly do exist, but they're quite a bit harder to detect than planets that orbit stars thanks to how much less light they receive and block.</p>
<p>Most planets that we can directly or indirectly observe have been hypothesized to form in the accretion disk of a star, but it may be possible that planets also form in dark clouds of matter in nebulae called globulettes. Because of how vast nebulae are, it's now speculated that millions or even billions of these starless planets exist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are planets called rogue planets - though wikipedia lists 8 other names that convey the same idea - that orbit the cluster/black hole at the center of its galaxy instead of any parent star. They are formed independently of a star system and never join one or are ejected from their home system and lost. We have observed such planets in the darkness. Our galaxy alone is hypothesized to have billions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Highly unlikely they form on their own!</strong> Pretty much all planets form from the left over dust from the cloud that collapsed to form the host star (with some exceptions where they form from debris discs around various objects). You can check this using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeans_instability" target="_blank">Jeans criterion</a> for cloud collapse. For a typical molecular cloud we are looking at half the mass of the Sun for gravitational collapse. This is still an order of magnitude higher than the largest planets. So this is highly unlikely to be the formation mechanism of the observed free floating planets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rogue planets people mention are from ejections from some star system and absolutely not from a formation process outwith a star. The ejections come about due to exchanges of momentum between two planets in a system (through tidal interactions). If a planet migrates inwards then the object it transfers momentum to will move outwards. If it moves it far enough it will be ejected. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another mechanism is that for very massive planets (~10 time Jupiter mass or more) they may have formed by gravitational instability rather than accretion. This can only happen at the outer edges of a disc and so are already in danger of leaving the system. As the star ages and loses mass it is possible that these giants would leave the system (star loses mass -&gt; planet migrates out).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There is the instance of large 'planetary systems' roaming freely in space, that may have been ejected from orbit, but these are not defined as 'planets' in the conventional sense, and are generally considered brown dwarfs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
