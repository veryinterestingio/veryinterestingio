		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is in anticipation of potential surgery. Anything recently added to the stomach can come up during intubation and go into the lungs. This can cause anything from pneumonia to acute respiratory distress syndrome. As a surgeon once told me, “nobody dies from missing a meal or a drink. People do die from aspirating.”</p>
<p>All the other answers about cooling the core, messing with blood pressure, and diluting the blood sound good, but have absolutely nothing to do with restricting a patient’s intake. Nothing they consume will have an appreciable effect on a really sick person. We give IV fluids in hypotensive trauma patients while waiting for blood and we can warm/cool patients more effectively with other methods than drinking water. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s assumed that anyone involved in an emergency/trauma coming in for surgery has a “full stomach”. There are different drugs utilized as a result in order to secure an airway or get that person ready to undergo surgery with general anesthesia. Every drug has a different risk/benefit ratio depending on the patients specific health issues and circumstances. </p>
<p>If the surgery can wait, we will wait bc it’s just not worth the risk of aspirating whatever is sitting in the stomach. If it is truly an emergency then we take the risk bc the patient would die anyways. </p>
<p>Long story short, don’t give anyone food or water in a trauma situation bc it will increase any risk of aspirating those contents into the lungs resulting possible death later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There seems to be two major explanations for this. </p>
<p>The big one is it's a choking hazard. People who are severely injured tend to vomit or could have trouble swallowing. So there's a chance this could end up in the lungs and now you have more problems to deal with. </p>
<p><del>A minor explanation is that when suffering trauma, shock is a big concern. Shock can cause your body temperature to drop. So giving water could sap heat from the casualty.</del> this appears to be bullshit. </p>
<p>If you are with an injured person and they request water it is advised to moisten their lips. Less than a mouthful of water. Just enough to wet their mouth and make them comfortable again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you’re not in a hospital and someone is bleeding in front of you your priority should be controlling the bleeding and getting them to the hospital. If you stop to drink a glass of water you’re doing it wrong. Like yes there’s the aspiration risk but most people don’t skip breakfast in anticipation of an accident anyways. Sure there’s hemodilution but it’s not uncommon to give a saline bolus while waiting for or in addition to blood products.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
