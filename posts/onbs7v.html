		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Reddit! We're a team of neuroscientists at the University of California, San Francisco (aka UCSF). We just published results from our work on technology that translates signals from the brain region that normally controls the muscles of the vocal tract directly into full words and sentences. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration to show that intended messages can be decoded from speech-related brain activity in a person who is paralyzed and unable to speak naturally. This new paper is the culmination of more than a decade of research in the lab led by UCSF neurosurgeon Edward Chang, MD.</p>
<p>Off the bat, we want to clarify one common misconception about our work: We are not able to &quot;read minds&quot; and this is not our goal! Our technology detects signals aimed at the muscles that make speech happen, meaning that we're capturing intentional attempts at outward speech, not general thoughts or the &quot;inner voice&quot;. Our entire motivation is to help restore independence and the ability to speak to people who can't communicate using assistive methods.</p>
<p>Our work differs from previous neuroprostheses in a critical way: Other studies have focused on restoring communication through spelling-based approaches, typing out letters one-by-one. Our team is translating signals intended to control muscles of the vocal system for speaking words, rather than signals to move the arm or hand to enable typing or control of a computer cursor.</p>
<p>Also, we want to note that this is very early work conducted with a single person as a proof of concept. This study participant &quot;Bravo-1&quot;, to whom we're extremely grateful, is a man in his late 30s who suffered a devastating brainstem stroke that severely damaged the connection between his brain and his vocal tract and limbs. Because he is unable to speak naturally or move his hands to type, to communicate he typically uses assistive technology controlled by minute and effortful head movements.</p>
<p>To summarize the approach used in this study, we surgically implanted a high-density electrode array over his speech motor cortex (the part of the brain that normally controls the vocal tract). We then used machine learning to model complex patterns in his brain activity as he tried to say 50 common words. Afterwards, we used these models and a natural-language model to translate his brain activity into the words and sentences he attempted to say.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we hope this type of neurotechnology can make communication faster and more natural for those who are otherwise unable to speak due to stroke, neurodegenerative disease (such as ALS), or traumatic brain injury. But we've got a lot of work to do before something like this is available to patients at large.</p>

<p>This technology sounds like an incredible breakthrough. What was it like working with the machine learning algorithm in a situation like this? How quickly did it start to work effectively? Were there any hiccups along the way? Do you think the algorithms developed would be applicable between people?</p>
<p>Thank you for recognizing Bravo-1! His efforts here sound incredible, as do yours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The New York Times just had a piece on this research. It's quite exciting to read about. Did you find that engagement of the muscles related to speech increases or decreases the accuracy of translation?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This must be what is known in science fiction as &quot;subvocal speech.&quot; I've seen it as a trope frequently, but honestly I found it hard to believe it was really a thing. So, you're picking up intended lip and tongue motions as well? I guess the part that's hard for me to understand is how a subvocal mike in the throat (in books, it's always a microphone that goes straight to speech on the other end) can pick up words that won't be fully formed until they go through the mouth.</p>
<p>Edit: I read your intro more carefully. I see this is different. I suppose I was thinking of the act of saying words as more of a sequential series of real time muscle movements; but of course they all originate in the brain and there is no requirement that the first one actually be physically executed in order to perform the next one. Wow, that is truly amazing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very exciting work! Is it only effective for those that possessed then lost the ability to speak normally? Would it be effective for those that suffered damage to their motor cortex at birth (e.g. brain hemorrhages caused by premature birth) which interferes with their ability to control speech? Obviously &quot;it depends&quot;, but just curious if this technique might be effective for at least some of that population.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
