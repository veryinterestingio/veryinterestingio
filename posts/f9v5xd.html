The doctors said the biopsies wouldn't hurt because the colon couldn't feel pain, and they were indeed painless. The amount of air they pumped in was horrifically painful however. </p>
<p>Trapped gas sounds trivial, but can also be extremely painful. Ulcerative colitis also hurts. So does diarrhoea. </p>
<p>So how do these pain mechanisms work? What causes the pain, if the interior of the colon is unfeeling?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A simple way to think of the colon and pain is to relate it to the skin. Lots of different things can cause different types of pain in the skin. There's pressure, heat, cold, cuts and probably a few more. There is a specific type of nerve ending to sense each type of pain.</p>
<p>The colon (the entire intestine, in fact) has only two types of pain receptors - ones that sense stretching, and ones that sense lack of oxygen (which happens when the colon is starved of blood). Trapped gas will make the colon wider, which sets off the stretching pain receptors. Biopsies don't hurt because the colon lacks the nerve endings to sense cuts and bruises.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctor here, please let me know if I haven't explained well enough:
Pain in organs (visceral pain) is very different to the pain you're used to experiencing in your skin/muscle (musculoskeletal pain). We have very sensitive pain receptors which localize all sorts of pain in the skin/muscles (including touch (pressure, cutting)/temperature/inflammation) - we have evolved this because it is very important we know quickly and accurately if there's a problem in our musculoskeletal system.</p>
<p>Internal organs have pain receptors, but not for touch - someone could be cutting your internal organs and you wouldn't feel it. They do have pain receptors for stretch (e.g. Bad gas), inflammation (e.g. Appendicitis) and when they're oxygen starved (e.g. Heart attack). These pain receptors are poorly mapped by the brain, which is why heart attack pain can be felt as jaw or arm pain, and pain in the liver can be felt as shoulder pain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nocioceptors are the sensory neurons that we call pain receptors. There are several different types. Not all types of receptors are present in all places of the body. The ones in the colon can sense mechanical stress (i.e., distention from gas), inflammation, and ischemia (tissue death). Gas can cause pain because it's physically putting pressure on your colon, and inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis cause inflammation, which will also trigger those nerves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You ever stub your toe really hard and have the thought, “crap, this is really gonna hurt.” The reason you “know” you stubbed your toe before you feel any pain is because the nerves that carry the sensory information that tells you where your foot is in space, what your foot is touching and that you just bumped it are different nerves than the nerves that tell your brain that there is pain. The first type send a signal much much faster than the pain type (the ELI5 for nerve conduction speed is a completely different conversation but also fascinating). </p>
<p>In short, different nerves send different signals and the nerves that send the signal for “pain” in the traditional sense (eg, cutting your finger) simply aren’t present in the bowel. </p>
<p>For more info, you can explore topics like: somatic vs. autonomic nerves, autonomic nervous system, enteric nervous system, referred pain, proprioception. I also recommend writing by Oliver Sacks and VS ramachandran if this type of stuff is interesting to you. Enjoy!!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
