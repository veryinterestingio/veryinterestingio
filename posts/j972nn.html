		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>i’m a coffee roaster &amp; i manage a cafe. it has nothing to do with extraction time. almost all caffeine that can be extracted is extracted within a minute of exposure to water. you can google this, there are plenty of studies. people say espresso has more caffeine too, however this wouldn’t make sense in an extraction theory because a average american style double shot of espresso should take about 23 seconds to extract. you can consult the SCA website for more info on what is defined as an american style double shot.</p>
<p>cold brew is sometimes served as a concentrate, so there are simply more ground beans used and as such, more caffeine. if it isn’t prepared as a concentrate, which many places do not do, it has the same amount of caffeine as any other cup of coffee &amp; you are experiencing a placebo effect because of your expectations. </p>
<p>this, along with cold brew often being consumed faster than hot coffee, causes it to enter your system faster and feel like you’re consuming “more caffeine” when you are consuming the same amount, just all at once instead of over 15 minutes. same goes for drinking a shot of espresso.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cold Brew, when it's served as it was meant to, doesn't have a higher caffeine content. The problem occurs when people don't realize that it's a cold brew concentrate. You're supposed to add water to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of bad information floating around about coffee. That's just an fyi for anyone looking for the best bean / extraction process / cup of coffee. In short, the <em>best</em> coffee is totally up to you.</p>
<p>Speaking in terms of caffeine content, however, the single greatest factor in the strength of cold brew vs. other brewing methods is the coffee to water ratio. I believe grind coarseness is also a factor, but I haven't confirmed this. More on that below.</p>
<p>Unlike espresso, which requires a lot of precision to make a good extraction, cold brew is much more flexible; you just need ground coffee, water, and a container (I like to use a large french press). As such, you can make a 1:1 cold brew batch that will be both tasty and strong. However, this also comes with a downside: when you buy cold brew, you really have no idea how strong it is or if it's been diluted.</p>
<p>Grind size is rumored to be a factor as well, though it probably has a bigger impact on flavor than anything else. The idea is that with a finer grind, you expose more surface area of the bean to water, thus extracting more caffeine and flavor. Of coarse, too fine a grind and you will have a very silty cold brew--not as enjoyable.</p>
<p>So it all boils down to dosage. Which makes sense, really; caffeine is a drug, and the more drugs you put in your drink, the stronger the drink is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hot coffees are brewed in anywhere from 18 seconds to 5 minutes. The high temperature, and pressure for espresso, allows the caffeine to be extracted quickly but if left for too long it will oxidize and taste bad.</p>
<p>Cold brewed coffee doesn't need to worry about oxidation as much so you can brew for pretty much as long as you want.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
