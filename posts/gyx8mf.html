<p>It seems to me that an exceeding number of people come out &quot;knowing&quot; how to do statistics, meaning they can use code to test data but without having a deeper understanding of the limitations of using statistical approaches to describe the world around them.</p>
<p>Any thought on the value and risk of building a society where we are arming people with statistical testing without giving them the purchase of the theoretical or even ethical way to use these techniques?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

What do you think about the lack of theoritical knowledge in the data science/engineering field? I feel like more and more data engineers are basically programmers who know how to use libraries, but not the underlying theories behind. And same goes for machine learning on a lesser scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
