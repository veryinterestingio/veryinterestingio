		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body restricts blood flow to cold parts of your skin to conserve heat. When you dramatically cool down your skin with ice, your body reacts as if it's in a cold environment and constricts blood vessels flowing into that area as if to conserve heat.</p>
<p>Swelling is the result of blood vessels dilating to bring additional blood and resources to a part of you that has been damaged. The constriction to &quot;conserve heat&quot; counteracts the dilation in response to damage so overall less blood flows into the area and swelling is reduced.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Contrary to what most people are saying on here, ice does not reduce swelling. It does reduce pain and has other therapeutic and helpful healing properties but there is no clinical evidence to support the reduction of swelling.  Also swelling is not an increase of blood flow to the area but rather fluid leaking out of blood vessels into the surrounding tissue. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this very slightly</p>
<p>During the process of healing, your body will also produce heat due to increased cell metabolism in the injured area - that's why, for example, a sprained ankle may feel slightly warm to the touch. </p>
<p>This heat can then have a knock on effect on said cell metabolism and make it slightly disordered and less effective. This can then increase scarring, and lengthen recovery times</p>
<p>By icing an injured area, especially in the early stages, you can displace a lot of the heat away from an injury. This has the effect of slowing cell metabolism and allowing it to be much more ordered, and therefore more effective at healing in an effective manner. This can reduce scarring and reduce recovery times. </p>
<p>This is also why we would place head injury / major trauma patients into a hypothermic state in many instances. Cool the brain down, slow metabolism which preserves the tissue rather than allowing swelling and disordered repair. </p>
<p>This is a slightly simplistic way of looking at it all, but is another reason why we ice swollen area.</p>
<p>Edit: as u/epote has pointed out the leap to brain cooling in trauma is probably one that shouldn't have been made here. Apologies for the somewhat misleading info. Left for context but consider this edit a redaction of that statement!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is some partially correct answers in this thread, but most of them seem to be taking information from experience or poor sources. I’ll try to bring it together a bit. I’m a physical therapist and athletic trainer, for reference.</p>
<p>After an injury, cells are damaged. Our body has several responses to damaged cells, all in an effort to return them to their prior state. The primary response is INFLAMMATION. Inflammation and swelling are often used interchangeably, but not necessarily the same thing. Inflammation is a biochemical process stated by the damage to healthy cells, and this chemical process creates a lot of heat, as well as being an irritant to surrounding healthy tissue and also causes increased nerve sensitivity.  There is also an increase in fluid collection at the area of injury, which is what most people think of as swelling. </p>
<p>The ice part of RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation) helps to slow the chemical process (to prevent more damage to other surrounding tissue) while the compression and elevation helps to decrease the EDEMA. Edema is another word for swelling, but it can be present without an acute inflammatory response. People with lymphatic deficiency tend to have lymphedema, which is a collection of fluid in the arms and legs that the body can’t process which leads to them looking swollen. Icing won’t help at all with lymphedema, but compression garments can be effective in management.</p>
<p>So, icing is helpful to decrease collateral damage to nearby cells after acute injury and will reduce inflammation, but it won’t do anything for fluid accumulation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
