		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The built-in arch compensates for the sagging due to heavy loads on the bed. So when the load is applied, the bed of the truck wants to be flat, instead of sagging down. This is more important for large trucks than it is for pickup trucks, say, because of the length of the bed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Couple concepts needed to understand this.  First, metal breaks when the stress gets too high.  Loading a truck trailer puts stress on it, you can almost think of &quot;load&quot; and &quot;stress&quot; being nearly the same idea.  </p>
<p>Second, stress goes in more than one direction.  There is compression (squeezing) and tension (stretching).  When you load a truck trailer and it sags, the top surface of it is being compressed and the bottom surface of it is being stretched.  </p>
<p>So when the truck trailer is manufactured, it can be made with a stress already in it.  I'm really going to simplify here: they put an upward load on the beams of the trailer as it is being made, and when it &quot;solidifies&quot; (i.e. the welds or the casting or whatever), the metal is stuck with that stress in it.  The top surface is stretched and the bottom surface is compressed and it is bowed upwards.  And this is the opposite of what a load on the trailer will do.  So say you add a load to the trailer slowly - the trailer is pushed down and that upward bow is less and less - and the built-in stress in the metal is actually counteracting the stress of the load, so the overall stress is DECREASING.  At some point the trailer is flat.  You can continue to add weight and the trailer will bow downwards.  At some point you reach whatever the safe limit is and you must stop.  But the whole point is to allow a trailer to carry more weight than it normally could without the pre-stress.  </p>
<p>edit:  Thanks for the gold!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This is what I am currently driving- well, I'm in the dock but you get the point.</p>
<p>We have upwards of 100,000 pounds (45,000 kg) of steel/aluminum on our flatbeds. The arch is to provide weight support so the deck doesn't bow under all that weight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's built-in so the weight will still keep the arch pointing up, it's not made to go flat or point down under design loads.  If it's overloaded the bow won't come back up. It's one visual cue that the trailer's not ok.<br />

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The weight limit without special permit is 40,000 lbs. Many times it's concentrated to a very small space in the middle. Were it not for the bend, the rear axle tires would raise due to the sag in the middle and would also lift the rear axle of the tractor causing traction problems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
