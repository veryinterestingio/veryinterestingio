		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After processing, pasteurization, and storage, orange juice loses of its flavor and aroma so they add &quot;flavor packs&quot; (made of orange product such as oil and pulp) to reflavor it so it always has a consistent taste. There are different breeds of oranges which contribute to different tastes along with picking and eating them whether they are ripe enough or not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's statistics. The same reason all garbage trucks in your town smell the same.</p>
<p>The Law of Large Numbers means that the more times you do something, the closer you'll get to it's statistical probability.  If you flip a coin you have a 50/50 chance of getting heads, but it's really not all that uncommon to get 3 or even 5 heads in a row. As you flip the coin more and more times the distribution of heads and tails over the course of all of your flips gets closer and closer to 50/50. Fruit juicers juice so many fruits that the large batch juice all tastes like the statistical average of each of the individual fruits. Just like the garbage truck.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The orange juice you buy from the store doesn't even taste much like actual orange juice.</p>
<p>When it says it is not from concentrate, it does not mean that the OJ is fresh squeeze in to a bottle.  It is stored in oxygen free vats.  Components of the OJ are separated and then later re-added to the liquid to make what they call &quot;OJ&quot;</p>
<p>The combination of pasteurization, the amount of time the juice is stored for, and the way the flavors are reintroduced results in the flavor being what it is.</p>
<p>Many of the flavors in fresh squeezed OJ go away after a short time. Store bought OJ is still missing a lot of them.</p>
<p>Different brands tend to have different characteristic flavors, but none are close to fresh squeezed. They're all pretty similar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
