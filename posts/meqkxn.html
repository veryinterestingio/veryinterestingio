It has incredibly simple rules yet lots of space for sophisticated strategy. How was it designed in pre-computer era, and why can’t we create a turn-based strategy that would be as deep and balanced?</p></div></div>

<p>Also, the game of go is 2500 to 4000 years old.  And should have been in that list.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chess developed over hundreds of years and the rules took a lot of changes as it spread across the world. There are a number of abstract games that have similar levels of balance and deepness despite simplicity.</p>
<p>And we do create similarly deep games all the time. Abstract board games come out in droves. They simply don't have a few century long advantage over other games that get popular.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The origins of chess go back to well before 1000AD. Shogi, which is known to have been played in the 11th century, is assumed to have a common root with chess.</p>
<p>The base idea behind chess isn't all that complicated - a board with a couple of pieces that have different movement options. There probably existed different versions and variants throughout time, and those variants that worked well became the versions we know today. The original version certainly wasn't the game we know today. After all, both chess and shogi with similar but clearly different rules must've developed from it, so it definitely changed over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chess wasn't designed at a specific point in time by an individual or group of people. It grew out of older games  with similar but not identical rules, and over hundreds of years the rules gradually changed. There were always different variants with different pieces across the world.</p>
<p>It was only relatively recently that the standardised modern form of chess came about, when people started playing it more competitively.  People 800 years ago weren't playing the same rules we use now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lack of technology doesnt mean lack of intelligence. Lack of education doesnt mean lack of intelligence. You're not smarter because you can use an i phone. You're not smarter because you know basic biology or chemistry that didnt have explanations back then. I like to think of education as ones opportunity to learn and intelligence as one's ability to learn. They are independent of each other. </p>
<p>We are certainly more educated than people hundreds of years ago but that doesnt mean we are collectively smarter. Intelligence is more about ones ability to solve problems and recognize patterns, and that trancends time and the knowledge that comes with it. </p>
<p>TL:DR People weren't stupid back then.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
