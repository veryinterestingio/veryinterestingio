		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.</p>
<p>This means that when you move your legs to one side, it pushes the chair to the other side.</p>
<p>But how come you can do it multiple times? </p>
<p>The answer has to do with friction. Friction steals a bit of the energy from your motion, but it can only take so much (momentum) per unit of time. So if you move slower, more (momentum) will be lost to friction rather than turning the chair. </p>
<p>That way, you can turn quickly to one side, and then turn slowly back, and you'll end up in a different position than you started.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Note that this does not need any friction with air or the floor or the swivel mechanism to work. Satellite use that to keep their orientation without expending precious propellant.</p>
<p>It comes from two things: conservation of angular momentum and you varying your moment of inertia.</p>
<p>Angular momentum is preserved, so you would think jerking your body around would bring you back where you started. And you would be right, if your moment of inertia didn't change.</p>
<p>Because ultimately what would bring you back is your speed of rotation adding up to zero in average. But in reality your speed of rotation can increase/decrease without changing your angular momentum: if you jerk your legs away from the swivel axis more when you go to the right, than when you go to the left you will rotate slower to the right than to the left, thus adding up to your rotation to the left.</p>
<p>In theory, if you simply do circles with your legs in front of you, you should turn in reverse direction of those circles rotation. This also explains why you can self propel on a swing, and why you can avoid falling by quickly rotating your arms on each side of your body.</p>
<p>Note that friction can help or hinder this phenomenon and is usually nonnegligible on swivel chairs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The force comes from your muscles. Pay attention to how you are torquing your upper and lower body in opposite directions. The swivel part of the chair has very little friction. The bottom part of the chair is providing resistance against the floor while the top part of the chair moves along with your lower body due to it's friction against your butt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think this is attributed to the force you are using to start the movement. If you do the exact same movement slowly, nothing will happen. But moving your hip with a quick, forceful movement into one direction and slowly moving it back means that more force has been used moving to one side than to the other, hence the chair is moving into that direction. If you do the movement with the same kind of force back and forth, the chair will also move back and forth. So I think the movement comes from your muscles moving around your body weight and the wheels of the chair &quot;transferring&quot; this into movement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
