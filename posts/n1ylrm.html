<p>If we're talking about frequencies and not notation, C is actually a half step up from B, and F is a half step up from E.</p>
<p>Why we arrange a piano keyboard (and musical notation) the way we do takes an exploration of music theory and history. But each available key on a piano is a half step higher than the one before it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>If it has to do with the wavelengths/frequency of these notes, why are the 7 main notes not evenly spaced?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The math behind this gets complicated quickly (not difficult, per se, just complicated), but the basic idea is that notes sound good together when the <em>ratio</em> of their frequencies is some simple fraction. 2:1, 3:2, 4:3, 5:4, etc.</p>
<p>Scales are built around the 2:1 ratio -- that's an octave. We tend to perceive notes with one frequency equal to double the other as somehow &quot;the same&quot;. So imagine a number line, and mark off a series of points at regular intervals. Label them all &quot;C&quot;, or whatever letter you like best, and pencil in a series of frequencies, each one double the last value. 200 Hz, 400 Hz, 800 Hz, 1600 Hz, and so on. Now we want to fill in the gap with a series of notes within each octave. But remember, we perceive the spacing as linear when it is in fact logarithmic. So if you want to insert, say, 8 notes between 800 Hz and 1600 Hz, you should <em>not</em> evenly space them at intervals of 100 Hz each to evenly cover that range. They won't sound right. What you want is for the ratio between notes to be constant, not for the interval between notes to be constant.</p>
<p>So how do we stick 8 notes between 800 Hz and 1600 Hz? We make the frequency of each one the eighth root of 2 times the previous one, so that by the time we get to the eighth one at 1600 Hz, it's precisely <code>(2^(1/8))^8 = 2</code> times the first one. (Don't worry about what frequency C is and why 8, the current scale is middle C at 262 Hz and 12 notes per octave but the underlying ideas are all the same).</p>
<p>That solves the problem, right? You want a 12 note scale, make every note the twelfth root of two times the previous note (about 5.95% higher). Easy... except that's not ideal either. Remember how we started this off saying we wanted notes to have frequency ratios that are simple fractions so they'd sound good together? The 12th root of 2 (or any Nth root of 2, for that matter) is irrational, so NONE of these notes other than the ones that are octaves apart will harmonize at simple fractions like 4/3 or 3/2. So what do we do? We mess around with the frequencies a little, trying to strike a balance between staying close to that consistent Nth root of 2 ratio, but getting as close as we can to including nice simple ratios that will sound good together as a chord. Thankfully, this doesn't involve too much change, but it does mean that no scale is &quot;perfect&quot;.</p>
<p>For example, you probably know that the first, third, and fifth white keys on the C scale make nice chords. If you didn't know that, go find a piano and press C-E-G together. It's very satisfying. But why? Well, the first few powers of the twelfth root of 2 are:</p>

<p>Notice anything interesting with those crazy decimals? The fourth power is pretty close to 5/4, the fifth one is pretty close to 4/3, and the seventh one is pretty close to 3/2. That's why the chords formed by notes 1+3 or 1+5 or even 1+3+5 sound nice, and that's why the notes 3 and 5 are actually four and seven keys away on the piano if you include counting the black keys.</p>
<p>I hope that's enough to answer the question &quot;why isn't this simple&quot; as well as give you a sense of what's happening behind the scenes of musical scales. There's no one &quot;correct&quot; way to assign notes to a musical scale, and different ones have been used by different cultures throughout history.</p>
<p>Somewhat drunk edit: so a few hours later I'm coming back to way more reddit notifications than I can reasonably respond to (thanks lol), but I do want to address all the replies I'm getting along the lines of &quot;this is too complicated&quot;. Those come in a two main flavors. The first kind are the ones saying a 5 year old can't understand this. To those redditors I say please, please read the sidebar. This sub is not supposed to be for answers literally pitched at 5yos, as such answers tend to be patronizing and unhelpful. It's about answers that are free of technical jargon and clear/accessible to average adults with an average education, which I hope this is. Default subs, amirite? The second kind are the ones that saying this is some kind of wild 200 IQ wizardry they cannot possibly follow, and honestly that makes me sad to hear. I was a math educator for several years and I <em>promise</em> you (yes, you, not the rhetorical &quot;you&quot; but the person reading this comment right now) that you are 100% capable of understanding what I was getting at. I know some people mean this kind of thing as a weirdly roundabout compliment, but it's not one. Don't put yourself down as a way of building others up, and don't be afraid of numbers. Math isn't magic, and there's nothing here that requires a technical background beyond a good grasp of roots and exponents. Maybe you got that in middle or high school, maybe you didn't, maybe you did once and forgot, but either way if there's an education gap there it's not an impassable chasm; that's a bridge you're perfectly capable of crossing with the right guidance if you want to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

But for an 8-tone &quot;octave&quot; the result is that the frequency distribution isn't uniform. But depending on what key you're in, the interval you're trying to write for your song/scale might be called either of those things. The frequencies are fixed. The notation is the wonky part.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The letters are &quot;meaningless&quot;.</p>
<p>I don't mean we just throw then out the window, I mean that they serve in relation to each other.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Remember in highschool algebra when you first learned the equation y=x+1 and you put it on a graphing calculator? It made a line that went up at a 45 degree angle. That's what we're dealing with in music. </p>
<p>Those letters only function in order, but for that order to mean anything we need a frequency reference. /u/wintermute93 gave us the formula to use, so all we do is plug in 440Hz and now we have the exact frequencies of the notes.</p>
<p>Problem is that this only explains why from the <em>modern</em> perspective. You need to know that we didn't always do it like this. The equal temperament we use today is a relatively recent invention. Before that we used &quot;just intonation&quot; because most instruments were not able to play all 12 tones in a row (a chromatic scale).</p>
<p>The system we use today evolved from standards developed in Austria and Italy 300-500 years ago. We actually had an &quot;H&quot; in the scale, but pruned it out because it was easier to write B and B-flat than B and H.</p>
<p>There's not a super accurate and clear answer to your question because it's a mixture of math, music theory, and history.</p>
<p>Source: degree in music and education. Knowledgeable, but not the god-king of answers. Other music theorists and historians, chime in if you want to explain the Guidonian Hand to OP and the role of the greek islands and the church in the seven modes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
