		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's not really a better answer to 'what' other than 'the immune system'. Common viruses can't cross the blood-brain barrier, so what you're feeling is not the direct effect of the sickness. In fact, most of the symptoms - runny nose, sneezing, coughing - are really the effects of your immune system fighting off the virus, rather than the doing of the virus itself.</p>
<p>The reason for the general malaise that accompanies the immune response is most likely your immune system telling you &quot;Get out of the way and let me handle this.&quot; Even if you could easily get on with your day in spite of the physical symptoms, the 'fog' motivates you to take it slow and rest so that you don't sabotage your own recovery. It's a crude measure, but we wouldn't have it if it didn't work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cytokines. </p>
<p>These are signalling proteins that circulate through the bloodstream and tell your body to be tired and try to get some rest. They are also released by any sort of inflammation, such as that caused by an injury or an autoimmune disorder. If you have a lot of inflammation, and you take an anti-inflammatory medication, you can sometimes feel yourself &quot;wake up&quot; from that fog as the cytokines are blocked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body can only do so many things at once. Fighting off an illness is stressful (physically and mentally), so you're not operating at full capacity in any regard - including your ability to think and move. This is obviously more pronounced when you're severely ill, but even a minor cold will have some impact.</p>
<p>Otherwise, a fogginess may also occur from the fact that your mucous is working overdrive with some colds. The mucous from your sinuses effects your breathing and eyesight - watery eyes and runny noses. There's generally more humidity around your face with a cold which isn't something you're always used to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two reasons. First, your body is spending resources fighting the illness so it has less resources for you to work with. Second, your body doesn't want you to exhaust yourself as it is already in a weakened state, instead it wants you to rest and stay in bed all day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
