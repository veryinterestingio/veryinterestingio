		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's this thing known as a &quot;frost line&quot;. It's the depth that the ground will freeze to, given a prolonged temperature.</p>
<p>Cities know how cold it can get, and bury their sewage lines well below the frost line. This ensures that they don't freeze, even in extremely cold winters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While the frost line is important for pressurized water main, most sewers are actually hot in winter. Most of the sewage comes from your house, where the water is well above the freezing temperatures when it get to the underground pipes. The combined heat from every waste in every house the pipe is connected to will keep everything warm, combined with the fact the pipes themselves are buried underground, with the ground itself acting as insulation. That’s why in very cold temperatures you can see steam coming out of manhole covers. </p>
<p>Drainage can freeze has it’s doesn’t typically contains any household wastes. Here the frost line is a bit more important, but not critical since there’s no pressure. It’s not as critical as water pipes, which can burst if they freeze because of the pressure. </p>
<p>Source : Civil engineer in Montreal. </p>
<p>EDIT: As someone else pointed out, the fact the water is constantly moving in sewers helps a lot. Pressure pipe, like the water line from the street to your house, can freeze in extreme cold if you’re not using it. That’s why it is recommended to leave a tap running if you’re worried about your water service to freeze. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all everything does not freeze instantly. Larger moving bodies of water takes a good while to freeze. And secondly it is under ground below the frost line. This is normal in all cold countries. In super cold places permafrost can cause other solutions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Native Chicagoan chiming in: everything everyone has said about the frost line is true, but Chicago doesn’t regularly drop this low. While we’ve seen windchills around -25 semi-frequently the last few years, that doesn’t affect subterranean infrastructure as much. </p>
<p>The current temperatures are very much an anomaly. Usually the “true temp” taps out in the single digits Fahrenheit. We haven’t seen a freeze like this since the 80s and it is affecting infrastructure that normally doesn’t have a problem. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dig down a bit and the temperature is always around 55 degrees or so. Constant, year round, regardless of surface temperature.</p>
<p>The Earth is a great insulator. The interior of the Earth is also very hot. Dig down too deep and things will get too hot. Dig down a little bit, just enough to go beneath the surface so that the ground itself insulates against the outside air temperature, and things start to warm up again.</p>
<p>This is why wine cellars are a thing. Wine likes a constant temperature. Put your wine underground, in a cellar, to keep it at a constant temperature regardless if its -20 degrees or 110 degrees above ground. Before an era of refrigeration or electricity this constant temperature was critically important to storage. Even today its common for wineries to have large underground caves for storage. The caves may be natural or man made but regardless of origin they serve to keep the wine at a constant temperature.</p>
<p>Dirt above the cave prevents heat from reaching the interior. The cool, wet soil is constant, and the warmth of the planet itself prevents things from getting too cold.</p>
<p>Very deep mines get hot. Some of the deepest mines on the planet are so hot due to the heat of the Earth miners can only work short shifts in refrigerated protective clothes before overheating. Wine cellars and sewer lines dig deep enough to be protected from weather above, deep enough to get a bit of warmth, but not too deep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
