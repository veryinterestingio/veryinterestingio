Why can't they just continue to employ the guy, so that he can learn from his mistakes and pick all this stuff back up? Surely it is not beneficial to have to introduce a new person to the job? Or am I just overly optimistic about the actual responsibility and workload of CEO's, and most of them are only introduced to their assistant and told where the toilet is, then plopped into the chair as a future scapegoat?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A CEO, especially at a large company, is the driver behind how the corporation as a whole is moving forward. They either creat or OK the ideas that define everything at the company, so if they’re not succeeding at hitting the benchmarks set forward by either the owner, investors or board of directors, they will often be replaced for someone else with a different “vision” or way of getting things done.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A CEO must lead the company, and vision and forethought are critical traits. Failing to establish a vision, and leading to ensure others understand and execute that vision is a huge shortcoming and grounds for immediate dismissal.  By the time someone sits in the CEO chair, he or she has made and learned from all the mistakes needed to be prepared for the role.  Not to say they can't still make and learn from mistakes, but they can't be of such magnitude that their company falls way down the competitive ladder vis a vis others in their industry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because share prices plummet if companies are not seen to be addressing shortcomings. It's not really about anything more than that. The market won't wait for a CEO to learn from their mistakes.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually this happens when CEO does not share the vision of the board of the directors.  So maybe the BMW CEO express a lot of skepticism towards electric car and is unwilling to spend more resources on them, or the CEO is terrible at execution and the board of director can actually find someone they know that's better at doing their job. 90% of the time is due to misaligned visions because even if a CEO had a few misses in the execution, there is absolutely no guarantee that they can find someone that is going to do a better job than that person.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
