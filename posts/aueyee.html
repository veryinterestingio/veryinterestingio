		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Benoit Mandelbrot, his name is on that famous fractal, asked the seemingly foolish question, &quot;How long is the coastline of England?&quot; It's hard to imagine a more well-mapped coastline, right? Mandelbrot stated that the coastline of England is infinitely long.</p>
<p>It turns out that the length of that coastline depends on the length of your yardstick. If you use one half a mile long you get an answer. If you use one a yard long you get a longer answer, because you follow a much &quot;bendier&quot; pathway around the coast, in and out of much smaller details than you could with the longer stick. A much shorter stick and you get a much longer answer because you are down to going around yet smaller and smaller details.  As the length of your stick gets closer to infinitely short you get closer to the infinitely long answer according to Mandelbrot.</p>
<p>You've never seen a picture of the famous Mandelbrot set, it isn't even possible to create one, the best you can get is an approximation. The set has more details in its perimeter than can be displayed on any monitor. A monitor will show what appear to be tiny little &quot;mini-mandelbrot&quot; satellites all around the main set but it is a mathematically proven fact that all elements of the set are in fact connected. They are all within one perimeter, the connections are just smaller than the limit of your monitor's resolution.</p>
<p>No matter how many times you zoom in on any portion of it there will always detail beyond the limit of your resolution. Every time you zoom in you'll still face the same problem <em>because</em> the perimeter of the set is infinitely long.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the easiest fractals is called &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake" target="_blank">Koch snowflake</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>The idea is: you start with an equilateral triangle, let's say each side has a size of 1. So, the perimeter is 3, right? Ok, now let's take each side, divide them by three parts, build an equilateral triangle using the middle segment as a base, and take the new sides of every new triangle as your shape. Now, the perimeter is 4 instead of 3. If we do all of that with every segment again, the new perimeter will be 16/3 (4 * 4/3).</p>
<p>Every iteration multiplies the previous perimeter by 4/3, and if you want to know what's the perimeter in the nth iteration, you calculate it by doing 3 * (4/3)^n. As fractals do that an infinite number of iterations, it will led to infinity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Or to put it another way, think of a line between two points, now instead of a straight line, split it in half and bend it out to make a corner. That line is now longer. Now you’ll take each of the two halves and split them the same way.... longer still, right? To make it a fractal, you never ever stop dividing and bending... ever.  Thus, you never stop adding to the original line’s length, and it is infinite.</p>
<p>The confusion comes with thinking fractals can actually exist in reality. They can’t. Physical matter can not be endlessly repeated down past an atomic or subatomic level. It’s just not possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can crumple up a thin piece of paper into a small ball. But what if the paper was even thinner? You could scrunch it up into an even smaller ball. The thinner the paper, the smaller the crumpled up ball.</p>
<p>So if the paper was so thin that it had zero thickness, you could crumple it up as tiny as you wanted.</p>
<p>The perimeter of a fractal is like a paper with zero thickness, just one dimension down. Each part is infinitely crumpled down, so if you were to smooth it out into a straight line, it would be infinitely long.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because fractals have non-integer dimensions. So it's not that they have infinite perimeter, it's that tools of normal geometry break when describing fractal objects.</p>
<p>So for example, a fractal with D=1.5 (such as a coastline or piece of stock data) has something more than length, but something less than area. Neither of those standard measures can accurately describe what the size of the fractal object with D=1.5 is. </p>
<p>So you get infinities with fractal objects when you use the wrong geometry to measure them. When you use the correct (fractal) geometry, you can get precise measures for the size of fractal objects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
