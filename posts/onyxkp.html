		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The concept isn't bad, and you can do this for some other viruses. But there are two technical problems with COVID serology for this use.</p>
<p>One is that we don't yet know a correlate of protection. That is, we don't know what level of antibody you need to be protected against infection. In concept, that's straightforward: You take a bunch of people, with different levels of antibody, and follow them, and ask which ones are infected and which are not. Of course, you can immediately see that this becomes complicated and you'd need pretty large numbers of people being constantly monitored, making this an expensive study. </p>
<p>The other problem is that there are many different serological tests, and they were rolled out independently without being cross-referenced against a common standard. A &quot;100&quot; on one test might be a &quot;1000&quot; on another, and it might be &quot;+&quot; on a third. There's not much incentive for a manufacturer (where the money is) to do these cross-reference tests, so it's left for academic labs (who don't generally have the money) to do them. That makes a large trial even more complicated, because you'd have to agree on a single test, or else first run a preliminary trial to build the reference table.</p>
<p>And the actual benefit of knowing this would not be as much as you'd think.  We know that the vast majority of vaccinated people do have a good response. The important aspects would be in terms of protection against variants (a moving target -- you'd need to re-start your dual large and expensive trials every couple months) and in particular groups like the elderly (even harder to get large groups of these smaller subsets). </p>
<p>That said, academic labs are in the process of working these things out; for example:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s more to immunity than just your antibody titers. Eventually your body stops making so much antibody, the titers go down, and instead makes memory b and T cells which can reactivate and multiply themselves should the need arise. Otherwise your blood would be a thick soup of antibodies to everything your immune system has ever encountered.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not every antibody protects equally well against infection. The ones that do are called &quot;neutralizing antibodies&quot;. But many of the antibodies our bodies produce are not neutralizing antibodies. specifically measuring neutralizing antibodies is more complex than measuring overall covid-antibodies. </p>
<p>also, Antibodies aren't the only type of immune protection. our immune system also has cells (like T-cells and the very badass sounding &quot;Natural Killer cells&quot;) that hunt for virus infected cells. So it's possible to have low levels of antibodies, but still have protection through &quot;cell mediated&quot; immunity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To measure protection, neutralizing antibodies are the probable measure.  These are not measured with your standard antibody tests.</p>
<p>The standard antibody tests are positive as a result of having an infection, or at least an exposure, but there are several years out there and no one has tested to know if having them translates to having immunity.</p>
<p>It is possible that one of these tests, or a degree of positivity in these tests could be a marker of immunity to at least some of the COVID strains, but no one actually knows.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>High neutralizing antibody titres correlate well with protection. However, low neutralizing antibody titre in the sera doesn’t predict immunity well at all.</p>
<p>Basically antibody titres can be useful at estimating the amount of time elapsed since inoculation (natural or immunized) but it doesn’t give you a great idea about how well your body stimulates a T Cell response against (re-)infection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
