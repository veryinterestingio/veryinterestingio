Yes, because the exoskeleton will push against the nerve endings in the tissue beneath the exoskeleton. If you touch the exoskeleton lightly, they won't feel it, but if you press hard, they will feel it.</p>
<p>On another note; some critters with exoskeleton have hairs protrude the exoskeleton which can pick up the pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Same with your hair all over your body. In case of humans they mainly exist for signaling you about insects. So the root part is very sensitive at signaling when the hair moves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tarantulas, and probably many other spiders have a ton of hair on their exoskeletons which are their main sensory organ. They can feel the sound and vibrations very well, as well as touches.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Regarding their (spiders) reproductive methods, they are unlike anything you might imagine. A male spider will create a web, drop his sperm onto it and put it in their pedipalps. Then, he'll seek a female and try to find out if she's receptive. If she is, she'll allow him to put his sperm into her spermatheca, which is like a small pocket in her abdomen. Then, when she lays eggs, she'll get it out of the spermatheca and fertilize them before wrapping them up. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>None of this allows for a simple rape. Male needs to get into a very vulnerable position to pass on his sperm, basically right under her fangs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When female spiders eat male spiders after mating, it is to provide additional nutrition to the eggs, which understandably takes a toll on the momma spider. It's in the male spider's interest to get eaten; Life does not have the biological imperative to survive, but to reproduce.</p>
<p>That being said, insects, spiders, and other relatively simple life forms don't really have thoughts or personalities in the way that, say, a dog or a cat might. They are basically tiny little meat robots that do as their genetic information tells them to do. For example, a spider can not be &quot;trained&quot;; it is completely guided by instinct.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Oddly this can be advantageous for the male's reproductive success. </p>
<p>Basically, once he gets it on with a lady spider, he has to go find another lady spider. If he will be unable to do so, it's better for his genes if his baby-momma eats him. If he's going to be unable to pass on his genes, it's better that the mother havre more energy to produce eggs and defend them. You certainly wouldn't want momma spider to starve.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
