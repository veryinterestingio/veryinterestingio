		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of it is a pain thing. Pain is good, it tells your body when something is wrong, or too much. If the drugs are taking away pain you don't know when to stop. There are things you may technically be able to lift but it will likely injure you, your pain sensors say &quot;no, this hurts and is too heavy to lift&quot;. This doesn't happen with drugs. </p>
<p>Very minor example (and don't do this it's bad for you): taking Advil before a run can help you run a bit longer because muscles hurt less.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain automatically limits your body so you don’t hurt yourself. It can override those limits with enough adrenaline, and many other drugs have similar effects. This is also why people get pushed back when shocked. The electricity contracted your muscles so hard you pushed yourself back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body has built in protection mechanisms to keep you from getting hurt. Some drugs can short circuit those mechanisms and let your body do things you are normally prevented from</p>
<p>A very intuitive example is that your jaw is strong enough to bite through your fingers. But if you were to try, your brain would tell you it’s a terrible idea and stop you. </p>
<p>Similarly, you can lift heavier objects under the influence of drugs or adrenaline in stressful situations because your brain senses or is tricked into thinking that your life is in danger, and at that point losing a finger or breaking a limb matters less than staying alive. So in a survival situation it’s worth losing the protection mechanism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain makes movement by sending signals (action potentials) along neurons to your muscles. These signals tells the muscle fibers in your muscles to contract, which is what physically causes the movement. </p>
<p>Your muscles are really strong,  as in, they will break your own bones if you fully contract every single fiber, so your brain has taught itself to limit these signals. </p>
<p>What adrenaline or drugs can do, is override this &quot;don't hurt yourself&quot; feature of your mind. In a scary situation harming a bone is usually better than the alternative. </p>
<p>No one knows how the brain works, and especially not a drugged or psychotic one, but it wouldn't be a stretch to say that such a mind can be really scared. Scared minds produce adrenaline, and that can make your muscles contract like crazy. The answer to your question could therefore be, that drugged or psychotic people can be confused and filled with adrenaline, which makes their muscles work on turbo mode!</p>
<p>BTW, when you touch an electric fence (not that you should!) the electricity only heats you up slightly. Electricity mimics the brains action potential, tricking your muscles to contract whether you want to or not. When people are thrown backwards after getting shocked they are not actually getting thrown, they jump involuntarily because of the electricity!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

It explains it pretty easily, while blowing your mind  </p>
<p>EDIT: It does not speak about drugs, but it explains why we can't always access our &quot;super strength&quot;, even though we have it</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
