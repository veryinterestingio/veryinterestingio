		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Routers are essentially tiny, low-power computers. They have their own operating system in there and everything.</p>
<p>When the OS is first started, it's in a 'clean' state where everything is configured and working properly. All the services are in place, all the connections are set up, everything is green.</p>
<p>As the OS works, over time it might encounter problems. There might be errors. Some of those can be easily recovered from, some not. Some of them don't cause any problems, some of them interfere with the router's function, slowing it down or outright preventing it from doing its thing. Restarting the router returns the OS to that initial clean state where everything is working again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Answer: Imagine a router to be like a post office. And data like the mail going through it.</p>
<p>One day, a particular large/deformed/mispositioned mail got stuck on the conveyor belt and blocks the entire operation of things from going on. And the post office has no idea how to take that mail out of the queue. So everything gets stuck.</p>
<p>Restarting the router is like clearing out the entire room, people, mail and everything, and running a super strong air blower to poof every mail, stuck or not, out of the post office. Then the people come back in to work and mail het processed again without a care of whatever happened before the restart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Long time embedded software engineer in telecom here. As many have discussed, these routers will have a small computer inside them. Actually, many have two or three separate computers, for example a CPU for the cable mode, a CPU for the Wi-Fi, and a CPU for the overall router function. </p>
<p>If *any* of these CPUs get into a snit, the overall function can fail. Also the CPUs talk to each other, and if the communication between the CPUs (that you can't see) fails, then the device function will fail. Most of these CPUs will be running Linux, but some will run obscure operating systems you've never heard of. None of them are running Windows.</p>
<p>The most common issue is just plain buggy software. Even if we are talking about Linux, it may be using a very old kernel, old libraries, obscure libraries, etc. The manufacturers go cheap on these things, and once it &quot;works&quot; there is a tendency never to upgrade anything again. </p>
<p>One more issue can be chipset compatibility between the router's Wi-Fi radio and the clients. This is especially bad for brand new versions of the standard (Wi-Fi 6) but can happen on older versions too. </p>
<p>So the problem here is just too many cheaply made moving parts. You have multiple CPUs talking to each other, one of the CPUs talking to your ISP, one of the CPUs controlling the Wi-Fi radio hardware ... and everything potentially running an ancient unsupported version of Linux. This is why most pros in the industry don't use these low cost integrated devices at all but instead use a solution like Ubiquiti Unifi. (Which has its own set of problems, see r/Unifi).</p>
<p>One more thing: there is lots of discussion of accumulated Wi-Fi errors (FEC errors). I am not aware of any process where accumulated FEC errors would lead to failure. Wi-Fi is designed to gracefully handle stations drifting in and out of range or hanging around on the fringe, this in itself shouldn't be an issue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s been a few years since a tech friend explained it to me. Iirc, he said something like when you power off/ unplug the device (most devices that use computer chips for that matter), it ‘drops’ everything it was doing. Essentially all the electrical signals flying around cease to be; including the ones responsible for whatever corruption is occurring. When you power on/ plug in, it’s like a hard reset. Again, it’s been a few years since and I’m certain there are much more knowledgeable folks lurking who will be happy to correct me but that’s the gist of what my non-tech-savvy brain could retain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One issue is down to memory leaks. When you write some program, such as the OS on a router, it needs to keep track of info (variables) such as a list of IP Addresses, list of connections etc. Each of those variables need to take up space in memory. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>What should happen is that when a variable is no longer required it is removed from memory thus freeing up memory to be used for other variables. The problem is if the program is poorly coded or has a bug then sometimes things don't always end up getting cleaned up and over time you run out of memory - either causing some sort of crash or making things run very slow. Restarting the device will clear the memory completely and remove all the junk in there..</p>
<p><strong>ELI5:</strong> Memory is like a jar you add marbles (data to be stored) to. What should happen is any marbles (data) no longer needed are removed but this doesn't always happen and eventually the jar overflows (crashes) and the only solution is to completely empty the jar by restarting your router.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
