		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is because of a common error people make when thinking about companies pricing products: It has almost nothing to do with the expense to produce it.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to make some money. You hire a worker and pay them $10 to make a product, you spend $3 on materials to make it, you spend $0.50 to package it, $1 to ship it, and $2 on marketing. How much should you charge for this product?</p>
<p>As much as you can get! The goal is making money, not offsetting your costs with a certain percentage markup. Obviously you need to make more <del>then</del> than you spent on it or you are losing money and shouldn't do that again, but even if you have a product you can't sell for more than you spent on it the goal is still to get as much for it as possible.</p>
<p>So in your question about selling a game that the producer doesn't have a bunch of costs they otherwise would have, the price doesn't change because there is no reason for it to do so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Phage is spot on with pricing not being related to costs</p>
<p>Another factor is that a manufacturer will often promise not to sell directly for less than a certain price as this would undercut the sales of their retail partners.  This is common for hardware that is rebranded and sold under a different name, there's no reason to buy the rebranded model for $80 if the identical original model model is only $70.  What the manufacturer loses in margin they make up for in volume and reduced distribution costs on their side (its cheaper and easier to send 10k units on a skid to a store than to 10k different addresses)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s all about convenience. Do you wanna drive to the store, wait in line, all that just to buy the game or click a button and it’s yours?</p>
<p>Same reason Ticketmaster charges like 120% fees on top of their tickets for online sales. Convenience. I’m sure not going to the box office and standing in line.</p>
<p>Same reason AMC now charges a convenience fee for online tickets. It uses no ticket stock but somehow they need to charge more. </p>
<p>You could go to Redbox and rent a movie for a buck or two, or click the button on your remote and rent the same movie for $5.99 or so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read that Nintendo have some sort of agreement with retailers that they won't undercut them with their online prices. If the digital downloads were cheaper nobody would go to the stores for them and they'd likely refuse to stock their games. I imagine that's part of the reason for other companies as well, on top of whats already been posted about charging what people will pay</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The MSRP is usually the same. The reason you would often find a disc cheaper is that the retailer (GameStop, target, Walmart, Amazon etc) has chosen to offer a sale or discount.  Whereas most digital sales are from the software vendors online stores.  While they sometimes do run sales as well you’re much more likely to a get a discount from a store.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
