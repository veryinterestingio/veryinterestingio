		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I live in India and recently in my state gyms have opened but under certain restrictions, the restrictions being &quot;gyms are supposed to operate at 50 per cent of capacity, shut down at 4 pm, and function without air-conditioning&quot; </p>
<p>I don't have problem with the first 2 but Working out without ac is extremely difficult especially when the avg temps is about 32C here with 70-90% humidity. It gets extremely hot and is impossible to workout.</p>
<p>Now my main concern is does air-conditioning really spread covid? is there any scientific evidence for this?</p>
<p>Also my gym has centralized air-conditioning</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>HVAC engineer here. Most commercial areas with central air conditioning units operate on mixed air concept. Where outside air is mixed with air that's exhausted from the zone, this is to reduce load on the chillers, and conserve energy, usually an array of controllers and sensors monitor the temperature, CO2 levels and other factors to maintain air quality. </p>
<p>However, for labs and hospitals often its full outside air with advanced HEPA filters, which are extremely costly to maintain.</p>
<p>So yes, theoretically. Reducing ac does infact prevent circulation of contaminated air. But, in practice it is not recommended.</p>
<p>Edit: I did more research and this is the official statement from Ashrae(American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers)</p>
<p>&quot;Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is significant and should be controlled. Changes to building operations, including the operation of heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems, can reduce airborne exposures.</p>
<p>Ventilation and filtration provided by heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems can reduce the airborne concentration of SARS-CoV-2 and thus the risk of transmission through the air. Unconditioned spaces can cause thermal stress to people that may be directly life threatening and that may also lower resistance to infection. In general, disabling of heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems is not a recommended measure to reduce the transmission of the virus.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well as has been happening in hotel quarantine here in Australia, the air conditioning has been linked to causing spread of COVID between rooms since they're not filtered to remove bacteria and viruses in the air. It has meant that COVID negative people arriving into Australia have managed to become infected from neighbouring rooms with COVID positive people in them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>HVAC infection control researcher here. It really depends on whether your gym is running recirculatory, mixed mode or full fresh air. There are multiple research papers identifying that recirculatory air conditioning systems can propagate infectious particulate further around an indoor area than without air conditioning therefore there is an increased risk of infection. If the air conditioning is a mixed mode or full fresh air then it most likely would decrease the infection risk due to the dilution effect as seen with the Wells-Riley model. So with recirculatory it could increase Covid spread, with mixed mode or full fresh air it could reduce Covid spread.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Early in the pandemic,  before the airborne spread of covid was acknowledged and extensive contact tracing was being used, attempting to figure out exactly how covid was being communicated, there was a case where 28 people who'd dined in a restaurant tested positive. There was extensive documentation of who sat where, location of the air conditioner, and place where person who turned out to be source of the infection sat: right underneath the AC whose outflow was directed across the restaurant.    </p>
<p>tl;dr: YES      </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The idea here is to decrease the number of times the air is recycled before being exhausted out. In theory the windows etc should be open or the airconditioner should run in fresh air mode (if that is an option. I work in a laboratory so we have specifically designed airconditioners which can go to 100% fresh air when needed for things like chemical spills.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
