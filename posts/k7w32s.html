		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Primarily because there are multiple strains of influenza that circulate differentially depending on a variety of factors. Influenza also has a high rate of mutation, which the means the prevalent strains circulating at in given season have changed enough that your immune system doesn't recognize them. Also, immunity to pathogens varies significantly depending on the antigen molecules (usually) on the surface of the virus or bacteria: Some are more easily recognized by the immune system than others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All the answers are going to explain that it’s because influenza mutates rapidly, and that’s part of the answer but not all of it. Unfortunately, the rest of the answer is mainly “We don’t know why”. </p>
<p>It’s true that influenza viruses accumulate mutations more rapidly than most other viruses. That’s not because they have a higher mutation rate - they’re pretty typical for RNA viruses, all of which mutate fast. Rather it’s because influenza proteins, or at least the ones involved in immunity, are amazingly tolerant to mutations. For other viruses, a mutation that changes the structure of the protein typically decreases the virus’s fitness. Influenza mostly doesn’t care - it can take many mutations in its hemagglutinin without losing fitness, so it can mutate and keep the mutations without being crippled, until it becomes resistant to immunity. </p>
<p>That’s unique to influenza, other viruses can’t do it. </p>
<p>But it’s not all the story. The viruses take a while to change, say 3 to 10 years before they change enough that previous immunity doesn’t work against them. (The vaccines contain four viruses, so the vaccines usually need to be changed just about annually. But the individual viruses in there don’t change nearly as often.) </p>
<p>But even if you get a perfect vaccine match (that is, even if you’re vaccinated and then one or two years later infected with the virus in the vaccine), there’s a chance that you’ll still be infected. And that’s even true (though not as drastically) with natural infections - you can be re-infected after some fairly short period. The reasons for this aren’t clear, but influenza infection, and influenza vaccines, tend to give fairly short-lived immunity. </p>
<p>Again this is pretty much unique to influenza, and you can use influenza to make predictions about other viruses. Influenza viruses have infected hundreds of millions of people a year for hundreds of years - they may be the most successful viruses out there. </p>
<p>(In particular, SARS-CoV-2 is very much a generic, ordinary virus in virtually every way. It doesn’t have the extraordinary and unique adaptations of influenza. You can’t look at influenza and draw any conclusions about COVID.) </p>
<p>Just to be clear - you should still get the influenza vaccine, because getting vaccinated annually helps overcome this short immunity, and even if you get infected after vaccination there’s a good chance the disease will be milder and you will transmit much less, protecting your family as well as yourself.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of the problem is f*ing ducks. Influenza was originally an avian virus that mutated to infect humans a long time ago, but still circulates in migrating duck population. The problem is that the flu virus doesn't cause the same problems in ducks, and can recombine (a type of sharing of genes, or sexual-esque reproduction), resulting in new combinations of virulence factors that haven't been see before (or at least in a generation or two).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To make it short once you have recovered from a virus your immune systems blacklists it from your body. If it ever try and infect you again it will be recognized in a instant and dealt with swiftly. Thing is some viruses are like a 7 ft tall black dude with a pink mohawk that runs around wearing nothing but a grass skirt, wich is to say your immune system see them coming from a mile away, and it acts quick enough so that no harm is done. But some viruses are for a lack of a better word &quot;sneaky&quot;, they have different strains, much like doning a disguise that prevents your immune system from recognizing it right away, wich gives the virus enough time to create havoc on your body. Some virus(like influenza) have so many &quot;disguises&quot; that its entirely possible you get infected  with it a dozen times</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
