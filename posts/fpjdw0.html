<p>By  <strong>Apoorva Mandavilli</strong>,        The New York Times Company March 25, 2020   </p>
<p>As the number of people infected with the coronavirus surpasses  450,000 worldwide, and more than 1 billion are locked in their homes,  scientists are wrestling with one of the most pressing questions of the  pandemic: Do people who survive the infection become immune to the  virus?The answer is a qualified yes, with some significant unknowns. That’s important for several reasons.People who are confirmed to be immune could venture from their homes  and help shore up the workforce until a vaccine becomes available, for  example. In particular, health care workers who are known to be immune  could continue to care for the severely ill.</p>
<p>Growing immunity in the community also is the way the epidemic ends:  With fewer and fewer people to infect, the coronavirus will lose its  toehold and even the most vulnerable citizens become more insulated from  the threat.</p>
<p>Immunity may also bring an early treatment. Antibodies gathered from  the bodies of those who have recovered may be used to aid those  struggling with the illness caused by the coronavirus, called COVID-19.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of  plasma from recovered patients to treat some severe cases. A day  earlier, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that New York would become the  first state to begin testing serum from people who have recovered from  COVID-19 to treat those who are seriously ill.</p>
<p>“It’s a trial for people who are in serious condition, but the New  York State Department of Health has been working on this with some of  New York’s best health care agencies, and we think it shows promise,”  Cuomo said.</p>
<p>The body’s first line of defense against an infectious virus is an  antibody called immunoglobulin M, whose job is to stay vigilant in the  body and alert the rest of the immune system to intruders like viruses  and bacteria.</p>
<p>Days into an infection, the immune system refines this antibody into a  second type, called immunoglobulin G, exquisitely designed to recognize  and neutralize a specific virus.</p>
<p>The refinement may take as long as a week; both the process and the  potency of the final antibodies can vary. Some people make powerful  neutralizing antibodies to an infection, while others mount a milder  response.</p>
<p>The antibodies generated in response to infection with some viruses —  polio or measles, for example — bestow a lifetime of immunity. But  antibodies to the coronaviruses that cause the common cold persist for  just one to three years — and that may be true of their new cousin as  well.</p>
<p>A study in macaques infected with the new coronavirus suggested that  once infected, the monkeys produce neutralizing antibodies and resist  further infection. But it is unclear how long the monkeys, or people  infected with the virus, will remain immune.</p>
<p>Most people who became infected during the SARS epidemic — that virus  is a close cousin of the new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2 — had  long-term immunity lasting eight to 10 years, said Vineet D. Menachery, a  virologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston.</p>
<p>Those who recovered from MERS, another coronavirus, saw much  shorter-term protection, Menachery said. People who have been infected  with the new coronavirus may have immunity lasting at least one to two  years, he added: “Beyond that, we can’t predict.”</p>
<p>Still, even if antibody protection were short-lasting and people  became reinfected, the second bout with the coronavirus would likely be  much milder than the first, said Florian Krammer, a microbiologist at  the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.</p>
<p>Even after the body stops producing neutralizing antibodies, a subset  of immune memory cells can reactivate a response effectively, he noted.</p>
<p>“You probably would make a good immune response before you even  become symptomatic again and might really blunt the course of the  disease,” Krammer said.</p>
<p>A crucial question is whether children and adults who have only mild  symptoms still generate a strong enough response to remain immune to the  virus until a vaccine is available.</p>
<p>Dr. Marion Koopmans, a virologist at Erasmus University in Rotterdam,  and her team have screened antibody responses in 15 infected patients  and health care workers.</p>
<p>The researchers are also using banked blood samples from about 100  people who were known to be infected with one of four coronaviruses  known to cause the common cold.</p>
<p>If those samples show some immune response to the new coronavirus,  too, Koopmans said, it might explain why some people — children, for  example — have only mild symptoms. They may have antibodies to related  coronaviruses that are at last somewhat effective against the new one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question: assuming you've fully recovered, are immune, and no longer contagious, could you transfer it to someone else? For example, if I recovered and gained immunity then later visited some people with the virus, could the virus essentially stick on me and then transfer to someone without immunity?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
