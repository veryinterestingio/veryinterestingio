		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a general principle of security, you don't rely too heavily (or at all) on obscurity. This precept is often stated as &quot;the enemy knows the system.&quot; After all, <em>someone</em> has to know how the money is being transported. And once one person knows it, other people will eventually know it.</p>
<p>But it's not like it would be that hard for any random person to figure this out.</p>
<p>&quot;Hm. Armed guards are putting tons of money bags in that Toyota Corolla. I wonder if they're transporting their cash now or not?&quot;</p>
<p>Only 25 to 35 armored trucks are robbed each year, compared to thousands of bank robberies. In terms of risk management, those are pretty good numbers for armored trucks. I don't think you're going to improve that by making them regular cars and hoping people don't notice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because we all know that these businesses ship and receive high value goods on a regular schedule.  It would take only a small degree of effort to observe them and note what this covert means of transportation is, and all you need to do is identify it and then its like taking candy from a baby.  A Brinks truck is a much, much, much harder nut to crack even though you can plainly see it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because covert doesn't help if people know what to look for. Plus, have you seen them fill an ATM? It's obvious in any car. The whole point of an armoured car is to make it as difficult to steal anything from the vehicle, and easier to investigate if it is. It's very difficult to penetrate, has constant video surveillance, armoured guards, etc. </p>
<p>Plus, if someone steals an armoured car, it's pretty easy to track. First up, it's big and obvious, and secondly, they have GPS tracking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of businesses <em>do</em> transport covertly. A large number of fast food type places, coffee shop chains etc do daily deposits by having someone count the cash out of the till drops and carry it to the nearest bank.</p>
<p>They do this to save the cost of professional transportation. The other, bigger reason is that daily drops keep the cash in store at the absolute minimum. </p>
<p>Combined with timelock safes that have secondary doors which don't open except for a small window during the day, a robber can only make out with whatever is in the cash drawers and if they're greedy enough to wait for the town delay of a safe, a few hundred dollars worth of coin rollers &amp; small bills.</p>
<p>Larger single location businesses like grocery stores handle too much cash on a daily basis to make this viable so they rely on secure transport.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Related: My first job was working for Domino's pizza.  When I managed the closing shift, I would put the cash bag in a pizza box, put it in an insulated bag and jog out to my car like a normal delivery.  I closed out the books an hour before closing so that this &quot;delivery&quot; happened while the store was still open.  I would just put any late orders onto the next day's books.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
