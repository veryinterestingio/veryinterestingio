The telescope has been part of a world-class research facility in radio astronomy, planetary science, and atmospheric science. Among it's many contributions to science, the telescope was used in the discovery of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulse%E2%80%93Taylor_binary" target="_blank">first binary pulsar system</a>, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/jpl/news/msg20121129.html" target="_blank">ice on Mercury</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1257%2B12" target="_blank">first exoplanets</a>, and the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_radio_burst#FRB_121102" target="_blank">repeating Fast Radio Burst</a>. It has been used to track hundreds of Near-Earth Asteroids with its <a href="https://www.naic.edu/ao/scientist-user-portal/planetary-sciences" target="_blank">planetary radar system</a>, surveyed <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/galfahi/" target="_blank">Galactic</a> and <a href="http://egg.astro.cornell.edu/index.php/" target="_blank">extragalactic</a> Hydrogen, discover new <a href="http://www2.naic.edu/alfa/pulsar/" target="_blank">pulsars</a> (at <a href="http://www.naic.edu/~deneva/drift-search/" target="_blank">different frequencies</a>, too), and open up the <a href="http://nanograv.org/" target="_blank">low-frequency gravitational wave window to the Universe</a>.</p>
<p>A number of users of the telescope who study a wide number of topics decided to come together to answer your questions today about the Observatory and the science it has pioneered, and share our stories of the telescope and Observatory. We encourage other friends of Arecibo to share feel free to share their stories as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>Megan is a pulsar astronomer who works on pulsar searching and timing toward the goal of detecting gravitational waves. Much of her pulsar research has been done using Arecibo thanks to its world-class sensitivity. She was a summer student at Arecibo, and has fond memories of that summer, subsequent visits to the observatory, working with the telescope operators and staff, and teaching others how to use the telescope.</li>
<li>Michael J has been working with Arecibo for over 8 years. As part of the ALFALFA team (Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (Arecibo L-band Feed Array)) he has worked on performing a census of the hydrogen gas in galaxies, and how the gas content of galaxies varies with their surrounding environment. Cool (100s to 1000s of Kelvin) hydrogen gas spontaneously emits a very faint radio signal with a wavelength of about 21 cm (or equivalently 1420 MHz). Extremely sensitive radio telescopes such as Arecibo are capable of detecting this signal from galaxies up to several hundreds of millions of lightyears away.</li>
<li>Michael L is a professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology and is also a pulsar astronomer working towards the detection of gravitational waves. The observations of those pulsars also allow us to understand the turbulent electrons in the interstellar medium, and the telescope's capabilities have contributed significantly towards those goals. He first visited Arecibo as part of their single-dish summer school in 2009, and has been observing with the telescope himself since 2013.</li>
<li>Luke has also been a part of the ALFALFA team, in particular trying to understand &quot;almost dark&quot; galaxies that have lots of hydrogen but almost no stars. He has used Arecibo's sensitivity in addition to the high-resolution imaging of the Very Large Array and Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope to learn more about the strange properties of these galaxies.</li>
<li>Sean is a scientist in Arecibo Observatory's solar system radar group. He specializes in using radar data to find the shapes and other physical properties of near-Earth asteroids. Sean has been working with Arecibo radar observations since 2012, and he likes to say that part of his job description is defending the planet.</li>
<li>Nick has researched both Galactic and extragalactic atomic hydrogen and molecular gas with radio telescopes around the world, trying to understand the formation of structures in and around galaxies, He was part of the GALFA-HI (Galactic Arecibo L-band Feed Array HI) team, which has mapped neutral hydrogen in and around the Galaxy.</li>
<li>Flaviane is a scientist in the planetary radar science group at the Arecibo Observatory working with radar observations of near-Earth objects and asteroid deflection techniques to support planetary defense. Her first contact with Arecibo data was during her PhD back in 2013, using radar shape models to study orbital maneuvers around asteroids.   </li>
</ul>
<p>All opinions are our own - we do not speak for the Observatory, the National Science Foundation, NASA, the University of Central Florida, etc. We will be answering questions at various times throughout the day, ask us anything!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Arecibo team,</p>
<p>I'm really saddened to hear that the observatory is planned to be decommissioned. It was an icon for radio astronomy, not to mention some of the earliest indirect evidence for gravitational waves. That being said, I have a a couple of questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Can the Chinese FAST radio telescope be retrofitted with radar astronomy equipment to map near earth objects? If not, are there plans to increase the power in current radio telescopes that also do radar astronomy?</p>
</li>
<li>I believe this is a sad but also teachable moment to show how reduced or complete lack of funding could cause a substantial damage to some of the most invaluable scientific tools at our disposal. What do you recommend to funding agencies and the public in general about the need to keep such important resources afloat?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for doing AMA.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
