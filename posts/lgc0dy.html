You can play with it just all on its own. These programs are usually smaller, and don't need to rely on much else or make any special changes to your computer.</p>
<p>Others are like hot wheels cars that come one of those boxed sets you get for your birthday. They come with tracks that have to be put together; you have to ask your dad for batteries, or you have to grab a chair and clamp the track to it; you have to put some ice water in the little container so the cars can change colors. These programs try to do a lot more, or work together with other bits of code, but they require more setup as a result.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Windows developer of 15 years here. Most of the answers submitted here (so far) are based on specific experiences/use cases - or are just plain guesses and not right. Dependencies for example, does not mean you HAVE to use an installer.</p>
<p>My best ELI5 is software applications are like home electronics. Some applications are microwaves (just plug it in and it will work) - these are EXE's, no complex setup required. However some applications are like home alarm systems, they require holes to be drilled, hardwiring to power and maybe connecting to the phone line. In the real world you would use an engineer to fit it, as it is very complicated and you (the user) could make a mistake. This is exactly what installers do in software, they take care of all of this work for you and ensure it's completed properly and can be reversed (uninstalled) in the future if required.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A program that can be run straight from an .exe file needs to be fully self-contained...the computer is going to load the first instruction from the .exe file to memory, run it, and away you go. This doesn't mean it needs to be a single file, but if it's multiple files the .exe file needs to be hard coded with where the other files are or how to ask the OS where other files are.</p>
<p>However, if the program needs other resources that may or may not be installed on the system, or needs to tell the OS various things to work (what kinds of files it opens), or needs information from the OS (what kinds of printers are out there, what other software is on this machine, etc.) then it needs to do more &quot;housekeeping&quot; to get that information, install anything that's missing, setup preferences, etc. That's what &quot;installing&quot; does.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>some ...actually most programs rely  on having supporting libraries, this  can be handled in one of 2 ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;bake&quot;  these libraries into the executable, while this makes your program self-contained and wont require any installation, it increase the size of the final .exe file and forces the operating system to load the whole thing on startup which might be a problem if memory is limited.This also creates  an issue if you want to actively support the software, as any update to the libraries you want to implement requires a full recompilation not to mention not all middleware providers actually allow you to do this as their software could be proprietary and could land you in legal trouble especially if your software is not free.</p>
</li>
<li>include references in your code that point for these libraries, in a &quot;relative&quot; directory and make calls to these libraries dynamic. this has the benefit of keeping your own code contained on itself, with its only outside connection being these calls, however this requires that when you distribute your program you must include its dependencies in the form of dynamic link library files aka .Dll files. this method also facilitates updates as an update is only required if the actual library call is changed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because most Users do not want to have to manage possibly multiple versions of the same .dll,  programmers develop installers that manage this for you while also changing any required options so that the program can do what's intended.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine that apps are people you hire to come over to your house and do something for you.</p>
<p>Some of them do simple tasks and are very organized. They bring everything in a backpack, take out just what they need, and put it back when they are done. That’s like an app that is a single .exe file; it has everything it needs in one place. </p>
<p>Some have big jobs to do, and need lots of tools and equipment to do the job. Think of a painter who brings a truck full of ladders, tarps, and different colors of paint. The painter might move all this into your garage while they are working.  That’s like an app that needs to install lots of files on your computer to function correctly. </p>
<p>Of course, some people might be able to keep things in their backpack if they were organized, but when they show up they just spread out all their stuff over your living room. Some apps do that too, even though with a litte care they could have been made as just a single .exe file.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
