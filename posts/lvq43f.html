If only 1 person was infected, the odds of there being mutations is minuscule. If 999 billion people were infected you’d have a much greater chance of mutations occurring.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every time something replicates, there is a chance that it will mutate, for better or worse. By extension, the more cases, the more times it replicates, the more mutations. In each host there are easily billions of replications. <em>Evolution enters the chat</em>. Each time it replicates, it either spreads, or doesn't. By survival of the fittest, those who survive replicate more. Some mutations fizzle out, other mutations that are more-fit, more virulent, more adapted for their surroundings, and spread quickly.</p>
<p>It's a lot like a wildfire. A small, isolated pocket is easy to squash. Once it spreads, the resources required to handle it, and the subsequent damage is waaaaay higher. If the wind (mutation) changes, suddenly a whole new population of fuel becomes available and the spread can start again. You either put it out entirely (New Zealand, most island nations), get it knocked down to the point that it's individually controllable (Australia)...or you get burnt. (most of the rest of the world).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way to think of it is like this:</p>
<p>Every time there’s a new infection is also an opportunity for a mutation, which translates the possibility of a variant. Therefore, the fewer infections, the fewer opportunities for variants to arise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is an overwhelming, unambiguous, and obvious Yes. </p>
<p>RNA viruses encoding their own RNA dependent RNA polymerase do not have the same proof reading abilities as eukaryotic cells and DNA viruses. </p>
<p>They make about one or two protein coding changes per replication and this variability in genome makes their genome actually a probability cloud called a quasigenome and they’re called a quasi species. </p>
<p>This is borderline on causing mutation catastrophe at the population level, and inducing a marginal increase in the mutation rate of RNA viruses is the therapeutic strategy of some purine/pyrimidine analogs, as well as some interferon stimulated genes. </p>
<p>Some think that this mutation is actually required for the virus to be able to cause disease and be infectious, and there’s good evidence of this from at least one RNA virus model. </p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16327776/" target="_blank">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16327776/</a></p>
<p>Every single infection causes mutation. Every replication of a viral genome. The only question is whether the new variants are sufficiently mutated in the spike protein so as to be no longer identically recognized by polyclonal immunity that recognizes the original variant. So far there seems to be lots of good cross protective immunity produced.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't find the original research, but microbes have a tendency of causing more difficult infections when they have a chance to spread rapidly and milder infections when they have less opportunities to spread. This was first proven on rabbits and anthrax - the amount of blood needed to infect a rabbit decreases as more animals are infected. So while the amount of variants may decrease it is also likely that the variants we get aren't as serious.</p>
<p>It is likely that swine flu (H1N1) was cultivated to be less virulent by strict regulations and that is seemingly happening with COVID-19 as well: When the SARS-2 was spreading in Italy it had very high mortality rate, but the slower it has been spreading the lower the mortality rate has seemed to be. Still too early to have conclusive results, but to me this explanation seems plausible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
