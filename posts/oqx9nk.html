		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, large vehicles such as busses use compressed air to apply pressure to the braking pads that stop the vehicle. However this doesn't quite explain the hiss on stopping because if the brakes are on while stopped then surely they want to <em>keep</em> air pressure, not release it right?</p>
<p>The reason this happens is because there are actually two braking systems at work, the usual driving system that uses air to apply braking pressure and the parking brakes which apply pressure with springs. While driving normally the parking brakes are held open with air pressure, but if for some reason pressure was to drop below a critical point the parking brakes could close under spring pressure.</p>
<p>It is an automatic safety feature just in case the vehicle brakes fail, but this also is how the parking brakes are normally applied. Normal procedure is to apply the parking brakes at every pickup, and to do this the pressure in the lines between the storage tank and brakes must be released. The hiss you hear is that happening as the parking brakes are applied.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ol>
<li>
<p>When the driver presses the brake pedal, compressed air is supplied to the brakes which is what makes the truck stop. When the driver releases the pedal after stopping (even if they just release it partially while still holding it down a bit) the air gets released under the truck making a “tsshhh” sound.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the driver going to be stopped for a while they might want to apply the park brake. The park brake works the opposite way, it uses air pressure to release and springs to apply. So normally when the truck is driving, there is air pressure in the park brake system holding it off.<br />
When the driver applies the park brake, it releases the air from the park brake system. This makes an even bigger “tsshhh” noise than just releasing the brake pedal.  </p>
</li>
<li>Then there is air dryer purge. Trucks have an air compressor driven by the engine. When the air pressure in the tanks is too low the compressor turns on, when the pressure reaches the maximum amount it turns off.<br />
But to prevent all the moisture in the air from filling the air tanks with water, most trucks have an air dryer fitted which absorbs moisture from the air as it passes through after the compressor but before the tanks. Each time the compressor finishes topping the air tanks up, a valve opens underneath the air dryer and high pressure air is blown though it, spraying moist air under the truck and drying the air dryer ready for the next cycle.<br />
This makes a big “tsshhh” and can happen any time the engine is running. You might hear it when the truck is sitting still or when it is driving.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>May someone please answer this; I thought the hissing was related to the suspension change in the schoolbus, when it starts hissing the suspension drops to allow easy access into the first step of the bus. I haven’t seen a reply yet covering this system of the bus. Is anyone sure the hissing isn’t the release of air suspension? Thx</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They have what are called air brakes. Traditional cars use hydraulic brakes, but with larger vehicles, the are more dependent on a pressurized air system. The hiss you hear is the release of pressure.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most air systems work in reverse. The pressurized air keeps the brake off, the brake pedal releases an incremental amount of air to apply the brake. The whoosh is the park brake releasing the air to set the bake on firm. The pshh to release the park brake is the valve letting air back in the system to release the brake.</p>
<p>Edit: the idea is, if there was a total loss of the air system, the brakes would engage instead of no brakes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
