		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ants actually have several different ways of holding onto different structures!</p>
<p>As others have mentioned, they have hooks/claws at the end of their limbs.  This means that for softer surfaces like wood, grass, paint, leather, and so on, they can literally just spike their claws into it- even if it <em>were</em> perfectly flat, they can still grab onto it no problem!</p>
<p>And of course, since an ant is something like 1/1,000^th the height of a human, surfaces that might <em>seem</em> smooth to you or me can still give plenty of spaces for an ant to grab onto.  Even sheet metal can have grooves or ridges in it that are several micrometers (millionths of a meter) across- relative to an ant's limbs, that might as well be rocks on a climbing wall.</p>
<p>But most importantly, ants (and other small insects) also have adhesive pads on their feet.  These are literally small footpads that get wet and sticky, and help the insect walk across vertical or upside-down surfaces, just like someone scaling a building with suction cups.  So even on perfectly flat, very solid materials, ants can <em>still</em> hold on with very little problem.</p>
<p>Between all three of those methods, it can be incredibly difficult to uproot an insect just with wind unless you can catch them off guard.  Aerodynamics also helps- wind likes deflecting <em>over</em> obstacles more than it likes pushing against them, which is why dust can collect on the surface of a ceiling fan even when it's on.  But overall, ants have several very effective ways of holding onto stuff, no matter how flat it seems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Insects are much smaller then people in a way that's hard to understand. Mass and volume scale with the third power of length, so trying to think of them like a &quot;tiny person&quot; doesn't work. </p>
<p>At their scale, they can see roughness in things we think are smooth. In fact, some insects exploit something called &quot;van der Waals&quot; forces, which is like magnetism without magnets. It's so weak we can virtually never observe it ourselves, but it work for certain insects because they're so small. It's kinda like an insect superpower.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apart from what others have said about tiny hooks, which is the main reason and correct, there is also the fact that all insects are incredibly strong in proportion. Ants can lift 50-100 times their size. This is because muscles depend (more) on area than on volume, while weight goes the other way around. So, with very small bodies, volume is minimised while the muscle surface ratio is maximised.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
