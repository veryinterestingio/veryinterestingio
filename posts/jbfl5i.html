		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your muscles twitch a little bit, randomly. Bundles of muscle fibers will contract a little bit, just to keep the blood circulating. Normally, these movements are too small for you to notice. You have a lot of strong muscles in your legs, so if you sit still for long enough, sometimes the random movements are large enough to feel if you're paying close attention. </p>
<p>You can learn to pay attention to the sensation of vibration in your legs. This is what happens over time when you keep your phone in your pocket and check it whenever it vibrates - you've rewarded yourself with interesting content/social connection for checking that vibration. So you learn to pay attention to vibrations in your leg. </p>
<p>Then your muscles contract randomly, and it vibrates the muscle. So you go to check it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is something that is normal and happens in everyone.</p>
<p>Normally the brain filters out such short feelings of vibration.</p>
<p>However, since having a cellphone in the pocket means we have legitimate sources of short vibrations on your leg,   the brain no longer ignores these signals, so phantom vibrations you would have ignored before are now consciously perceived.</p>
<p>Similarly, certain air vibrations which were normally ignored before can now be interpreted as audible phone rings.</p>
<p>By having a cellphone you basically train your brain to detect certain patterns as an incoming phone call, and then random disturbances are falsely detected as a call.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have no idea if this is true, but I once read a theory that people's nervous systems begin to memorize the stimulus of the phone vibration. Essentially, this theory stated that your nervous system, over time, thinks you are trying to train or alert yourself with the stimulus, so it attempts to replicate the sensation to help you. Basically, your body is noticing something happens a lot, doesn't understand why, but is trying to be helpful. This was in a science journal, but it was just a theory being researched, no idea what they ever decided on the matter. Honestly, the theory made sense to me tho.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically the brain gets used to your phone vibrating now and then in your pocket, so when something lightly touches your pocket or muscle twitches in that area the brain interprets that feeling as a phone vibrating.</p>
<p>There's a youtuber who uploads videos about different facts and mysteries, would recommend him if you are into it. He made a video a few years ago about different facts</p>
<p>He talks about it more in this video at the second fact
