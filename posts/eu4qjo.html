		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sleep cycles. It takes you 45 minutes after falling asleep to reach REM and 45 minutes to get out of it, for a total of 1.5 hours. You do this repeatedly during the night and if you wake up in the middle of a sleep cycle your body is still full of sleep hormones.</p>
<p>So sleep in times that are divisible by 1.5. So 1.5, 3, 4.5, 6, 7.5 etc. You'll feel much better and less tired even if you sleep fewer hours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's an Android app (for Apple too I guess) called Sleep that does many things - one of these is monitoring your sleep cycle based on your movement. Place the phone it on your bed, set an alarm time and it will wake you somewhere within the 30 minutes before that at the best time for your cycle. I've found it very effective. I think it has a 10 day free trial and even then it's only a fiver.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If you wake up at the end of a cycle you will feel much better than waking up mid cycle. Even if you have slept for less time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Compare your sleep cycle to that of a washing machines spin cycle. A washing machine is full of dirty clothes. Think of this as all the stress and fatigue that you've built up throughout the day.</p>
<p>Once the wash starts, it will start to spin the clothes around. This is you asleep.</p>
<p>Once the wash is going, it will start to fill up with all the detergent and water that cleans the clothes. This is your REM sleep. </p>
<p>The cycle will alternate between spinning to get all the grime out of your clothes, and filling up with water and detergent to clean said clothes until it is done. Just like your sleep cycle, you'll alternate between lighter sleep and REM sleep. Each REM cycle that happens, your mind will get 'cleaner'. </p>
<p>Now, imagine that you open the door to your washing machine while it's filled up with all the soapy water. Your clothes are not clean, they're just a different type of dirty now covered in all the soap that hasn't been spun off yet. That is what it's like when you wake up during a REM sleep cycle. Except instead of soapy water, it's all the hormones whose job it is to clean out your brain ready for the next day. </p>
<p>That's why you can awake at 4am, and fall back asleep and feel fine sometimes. It just meant that you woke up when you weren't in a REM cycle. This is useful for survival as an un-evolved human because it allowed us to effectively wake up and double check our surroundings at night with no consequences. REM sleep is segmented and will happen every few hours or so, but is different for every person. So if you experiment, you might find that you feel terrible after an 8 hour sleep. If so, try doing a 7 or a 9 hour sleep instead. It might just be that 8 hours is bang in the middle of your REM cycle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
