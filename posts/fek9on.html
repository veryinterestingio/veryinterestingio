		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The LC in LCD stands for Liquid Crystals. You can think of them kind of like water in a video game. They flow like a liquid, but they follow predictable patterns. The ones in your monitor are special in that they change their patterns when there is an electric current. So you can make them clear like water, or opaque like coffee. </p>
<p>It turns out this is pretty useful! </p>
<p>Let's say you shine a light toward a piece of paper with three holes that have red, green, and blue filters. If you block all but the red one, the light will be red. If you do it with all but the blue one you'll get blue light. You can also mix and match colors to make all sorts of different colors. </p>
<p>Blocking the holes manually takes a lot of time, but by using liquid crystals you can do it very quickly. By putting a layer of liquid crystals between the light and the holes with colored filters, you can let as much, or as little, light through as you need. So you can mix a little red, some blue, and a lot of green, or anything any between. And you can this very quickly. </p>
<p>If you take millions of these and make them very small, you basically have a monitor. Since liquid crystals behave a lot like liquids, if you put pressure on them they will flow. That will change how the light passes through it which causes distortions. Much like how ripples on a pond makes the bottom look weird.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This depends on which type of screen you have. There are LCD screens, or Liquid Crystal Display, where pushing on the screen pushes these crystals around, similar to how water moves in a plastic bag when you push on the water.</p>
<p>There are also OLED, which has a carbon layer, another substance, sandwiched between two electrodes, or basically a conductor. When electricity flows through this sandwich, it will emit light. Pressing on an OLED screen will not distort the image unless you are putting excessive force.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Patient: Doctor it hurt when I do this. </p>
<p>Doctor: Stop doing that</p>
<p>But seriously it's due to polarization in LCD screens. When certain types of plastic are under stress, cross-polarized light (which is how an LCD makes bright pixels turn dark) will create weird rainbows and other effects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
