<p>Beyond this, cloud formation and tidal patterns can give you clues about islands long before you can see the actual island.</p>
<p>However, the most likely method for groups like Polynesians would have been simply following birds. Migratory birds &quot;island hop&quot;, so all you need to do is know the difference between various kinds of birds and follow the right ones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Supposedly his people would go out farther and farther (on hand made boats) each yeah and chart broader maps each time, eventually, after some ridiculous amount of years they found islands which were the Hawaiian islands. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Vikings have in their oral histories stories of a sailor being blown off course in the North Atlantic and spotting land. That particular expedition didn't land (or at least didn't stay), but the report did prompt a bigger expedition later to find the distant reported lands, which ended up being Newfoundland.   <a href="https://www.historyonthenet.com/viking-explorations-and-settlements-iceland-greenland-and-vinland" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.historyonthenet.com/viking-explorations-and-settlements-iceland-greenland-and-vinland" target="_blank">https://www.historyonthenet.com/viking-explorations-and-settlements-iceland-greenland-and-vinland</a></a></p>
<p>The other major &quot;open sea&quot; explorers pre-dating &quot;modern&quot; systems were the Polynesians.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Polynesians were excellent sailors, and could survive at sea the way Eskimos could survive in the Arctic. Namely, they were very good at finding food and collecting water. Failing extended calm weather, there is no reason to think they couldn't store enough food/water/coconuts in their canoes for a lengthy voyage, and push it even longer by fishing, collecting rainwater (it does rain at sea), etc; and following birds as the birds flew from island to island. They could also 'read' the sea, knowing which seaweed and fish species preferred shallower waters v. deeper waters, navigating by the stars, which birds stayed close to land and which ventured long distances, etc etc.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There are also ways to 'read' the waves and currents. For example, if waves are coming at your boat from both 11:00 and 1:00 angles, but the wind is only behind the 11:00, what is causing the waves from 1:00? Is it a current, or is there an island the waves are wrapping around? I don't have the skills to know, but Polynesians figured out how to tell the difference just by feeling the motion and watching the sea in action.</p>
<p>Later, once the sea was 'charted' (ok, known), they established a phenomenal method of charting the islands and referencing the various primary winds, currents, and islands using just shells, sticks, and other natural items to make what (to me) looks like a dream-catcher. Here is a short video that explains the basics, though it hardly does justice the ability of the wayfinders: <a href="https://youtu.be/_1ibG0Fj7oE" target="_blank"><a href="https://youtu.be/\_1ibG0Fj7oE" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/\_1ibG0Fj7oE</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
