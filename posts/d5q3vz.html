		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People can, but they generally panic and don't. It's pretty much a case of our brains over-thinking and fighting our natural instincts resulting in drowning. Not that it isn't still possible for animals to drown, but it's weird how many humans only can't swim because they think they can't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think, more than anything, it's actually a case of how our body is shaped. Think about dogs and doggy paddling. If you throw a dog who's never swam before into the water, their bodies will naturally float with the belly down and back up, just like how they walk. When they make the same motions they make when walking, they'll slowly paddle forward. Essentially, for most quadrupedal animals, because of how they move and where their center of gravity is, they move in water the same they move in land, and naturally float upright if buoyant enough.</p>
<p>Look at how humans move, on the other hand. We walk bipedally, and our center of gravity is high off the ground. If we were dropped in the water the natural position we'd float to is either on our backs (leaves the head upside down very close to the water), or on our chests (plops your face right into the water). Not to mention, we definitely cannot move underwater the same way we do on land, like quadrupedal animals can. It takes very specific movements to move effectively in water, and while doggy paddling isn't complicated, it's still much different to our normal movement. Simply walking upright while floating in water will get you nowhere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
