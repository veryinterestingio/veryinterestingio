in winter people spend more time inside of buildings due to the cold weather. the air in the buildings is heated and more dry, your nose usually filters the air you breathe but if the inside of your nose is too dry the filtering does not work so well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The air is not as dense in the summer and is more humid, so the droplets tend to fall to the ground faster and get burned up in the sun. Keep in mind, as disease spread tends to lessen in the summer, it never actually goes away. People still get colds, flu, and COVID in warm weather.</p>
<p>*EDIT* Here is the citation; </p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20151016-the-real-reason-germs-spread-in-the-winter" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20151016-the-real-reason-germs-spread-in-the-winter" target="_blank">https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20151016-the-real-reason-germs-spread-in-the-winter</a></a> </p>
<p>Lab experiments, for instance, have looked at the way flu spreads among groups of guinea pigs. In moister air, the epidemic struggles to build momentum, whereas in drier conditions it spreads like wildfire. And comparing 30 years’ worth of climate records with health records, Jeffrey Shaman at Columbia University and colleagues found that <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000316" target="_blank"><strong>flu epidemics almost always followed a drop in air humidity</strong></a>.</p>
<p>In fact, the overlap of the graphs was so close, “you could pretty much put one on top of each other,” says Metz, who together with Adam Finn, recently <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445315001061" target="_blank"><strong>reviewed all the evidence</strong></a> for the Journal of Infection. The finding has now been replicated many times including analyses of the <a href="http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/173/2/127.short" target="_blank"><strong>2009 Swine flu pandemic</strong></a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Among other reasons, noses are naturally runny in colder weather because the cilia stop performing the duty of sweeping mucus back into the nasal sinuses. Infected people tend to wipe their noses unconsciously, and then touch such surfaces as shopping cart handles. Subfreezing temperatures, like those in a grocery store's parking lot are not an ideal biological temperature for reproduction, but they are an ideal temperature for preservation. So the shopping carts are brought indoors, people touch the infected handles, and when they go back into the cold their nose starts running. They then touch their noses and the cycle of life begins again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>During the winter, the cold as well as reduced exposure to vitamin D (shorter days) have a negative effect on the immune system which pretty much affects everyone. On top of that, people spend a lot more time indoors in close contact</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
