		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I always understood this to be a form of “resetting” yourself. I had sleep issues for awhile and my therapist provided me with a pre bedtime routine to practice, mostly light stretching. Said to do it in an entirely other room away from my bedroom, as well. Then when I’d go to sleep and still struggle, I’d have to get up and go Re do the routine and re set. Sometimes we just can’t sleep and need to reset our body and mind - changing rooms does wonders for this. Cool - now someone more smarter than me provide a more interesting answer, please.</p>
<p>Edit:  the irony here is that I had the worst nights sleep I’ve had in the past year last night after commenting this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have anxiety so when I can't fall asleep on my comfortable, expensive mattress, it starts eating away at me and building up to a big issue (adrenaline pumping, etc). I think, &quot;This is a nice mattress, the room is dark, it's quiet, what's wrong with you??' But when I move to the couch, the bar is immediately lowered and in a way, my guard is down. I know to expect very little of a couch. But that calmness ends up lulling me to sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A professor of mine (my advisor and chair of the Psyche department) said this &quot;If you are in your bed and you are not sleeping, get out and do something else.&quot;</p>
<p>A flaw in our modern way of living is that we do things that make us associate the bed with not sleeping, things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>reading in bed</li>
<li>watching TV</li>
<li>Cell phone use in bed</li>
</ul>
<p>So if it's not anxiety, it's that you've (on a subconscious level) told yourself that bed =/= sleep but bed=other stuffs.</p>
<p>His advice to get out and do something else has worked for me.  Another helper is to re-arrange your bedroom.  If you have been anxious, ill or just had a lot on your mind, your bedroom now has &quot;cues&quot; that could trigger those memories and again no sleep.  Until you conk out on the couch because it <em>doesn</em>'t have those cues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you’ve something big in your life that’s taking up multiple days of consideration, you might lay in bed completely comfortably and still be devoting 50% of your brain energy towards it and now that thing is all you can think about.</p>
<p>Then you lie on the couch, and your body takes 20% of your attention and focuses it on parts of your body that are ‘uncomfortable’.</p>
<p>Now maybe your brain has something smaller it can focus on, and you can relax to the point where you’re asleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
