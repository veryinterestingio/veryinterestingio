		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know the answer. But I do know that once, a couple years back, I got the urge to cook something at night. So, obviously, I decided to make some meringue cookies like any regular human being would... You know, at 11 p.m. They were fairly simple, and I intended on making around 30 of them. </p>
<p>Turned out I got a bit of the recipe wrong and ended up with 300 of them. Yep.</p>
<p>I swear to god, they just never stopped coming. And they're fucking whipped eggs, you can't just hold on to the batter for later. It was so overwhelming my family just gave up on helping me sometime around the 100th cookie and went to sleep.</p>
<p>At 3 a.m. I had some 300 cookies, a sore back, and smelled like eggs. I could think straight no longer. The next day I was stuck with three fucking hundred cookies. I had to give them out in college, to friends, family members, everyone... </p>
<p>Also, just think about how you'd react if someone just walked up to you with a fucking bowl full of meringue cookies and said &quot;Hey, want some? I've got 300 of these, pass it around! Also, good morning.&quot; - Yes, that was literally me.</p>
<p>They still lasted a long fucking time. I never ate them again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>for me, personally, it's the fact that everybody is sleeping. don't ask me why but people knowing i'm doing something productive gives me anxiety.</p>
<p>also, usually no matter how much motivation you have, you don't end up doing it. but it's okay, it's 3am and you're supposed to be sleeping, who could blame you for not being productive. unlike during the day, you don't feel guilt for not doing something.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
