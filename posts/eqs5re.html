		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>USB cabling and receptacle buses are cheaper than ethernet cables.</p>
<p>USB has greater port density, and will fit cleanly into thinner form factor platforms.</p>
<p>USB 3.0 has ~5 gbps transfer rate, whereas cat5e gets stable 1gbps.  Getting 10Gbps typically requires cat6e ethernet cables or fiber, which are not exactly flexible and definitely not as cheap.</p>
<p>Copper ethernet is also rated for 100 meters; you would not get very good throughput at 100s of meters on copper.  Granted, this isn't typically a requirement for USB based eqpt either.</p>
<p>Eli5 edit:</p>
<ol>
<li>USB cable and especially the equipment you plug into (buses/controllers) cheaper than ethernet</li>
<li>Fit more USB ports in tiny space (known as port density)</li>
<li>USB faster than ethernet for price, especially on modern solutions like USB-C</li>
<li>Ethernet is better at longer distances, which is why networking equipment uses it, but your keyboard does not need to</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This comes down to the intended use of the Device more than anything else. HDMI to Ethernet adapters do exist, and Ethernet can obviously handle the bandwidth required for a 1080p video stream, but a lot of the &quot;extra pins&quot; HDMI has cover audio, error detection, frame timing etc. Classically the interface to provide a usable signal on the video output end is provided by the input device, and monitors, TV's, etc tend to follow this pattern.</p>
<p>In the case of USB, the devices themselves have to be smart enough to tell the computer how they're connecting and what sort of functionality they'll perform.</p>
<p>Bandwidth isn't the end all consideration when determining what the most efficient way to transmit information is. While transmitting the required signals via ethernet may be possible it wasn't designed to support the wide array of applications better suited to specific connector types.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So what is being conflated here is Ethernet cables and Ethernet, HDMI cables and HDMI, etc. We need to talk about the physical layer and the protocols separately. </p>
<p>Ethernet is a protocol that can be run on top of a number of physical layers. Most people think of Ethernet cable as twisted shielded pair. </p>
<p>This is a type of transmission line that has an impedance of about 100 ohms. Depending on a number of factors like the dielectric loss, and how uniform the impedance of the line is different sorts of transmission lines have different bandwidths. The usable bandwidth of a CAT6A cable is about 500 MHz. The rest of the bandwidth comes from additional channels or QAM modulation techniques. </p>
<p>Now what are SATA cables? Well they are differential pair signals as well. So is HDMI, copper differential signal pairs.</p>
<p>Now imagine you want to send a signal down a transmission line and you want it to switch on and off at 20 GHz. Well you can actually do that on any sort of cable, the question really is just how much of the signal will actually make it to the other end and what it will look like. If its just loss and not lots of horrific reflections then you just need to just put repeaters in the cable or make it short enough. If the transmission line has a lot of dispersion then the shape of the signal will get lost and it will become hard to &quot;see&quot;. These factors are often shown with something called an eye diagram, the more open the eye is the better the signal integrity of the communication channel. </p>
<p>The fact that Ethernet can be 100 m long means that the dispersion and the loss of the cable have to be low at the frequencies that protocol is used at. As others have pointed out HDMI has a lot more bandwidth so the cables can't be as long or the transmission line quality has to be better. Cheap cables mean lower transmission line quality. </p>
<p>The very best cables that are not optical (in terms of bandwidth) tend to be rigid pipes that are quite a lot like coax but have the center conductor basically floating in air with little spacers, these get up above 100 GHz.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
