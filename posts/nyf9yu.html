<p>Verizon turned 3G off completely last year, AT&amp;T is planning to in February of 2022, and T-Mobile will turn off their 3G and Sprint's old 3G around the same time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Useless can be subjective. I still use iPhone 4s with 3G and my speeds are 6 megabits per second. Some people call that useless but for many people even in the developed world that is very useful.</p>
<p>Whether 3G is being decommissioned or not often depends on the locality. Often regions are designated specific licenses to operate some bands have most use for 3g wheras other bands have more than one mode being used. </p>
<p>For example, in many places in Ohio AT&amp;T is authorized a certain chunk of the 800 MHz spectrum depending on the part of the state. My understanding is the way this is authorized in these parts doesn't make it always easier for them to light up 4g on 800 MHz so it's more economical to just keep 3g here consequently 3G is ok in many parts of Ohio.</p>
<p>Some frequencies used for 3G are better able to go over obstructions or go through them. As a result, whether a tower gets turned off or not can make a great deal of influence whether your service goes out. It's possible your area was never that great for the used 3g frequencies by your carrier in your locale. So when they turned off a single tower then that ruins your service quality</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
