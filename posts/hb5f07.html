<p>For example reaction times are way slower than while sober. They are depressed hence why it’s a depressant</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people think of &quot;depressed&quot; as being sad.  But the term &quot;depress&quot; has a broader meaning; it means to lower or suppress.  In the case of alcohol, it &quot;depresses&quot; or reduces the activity of parts of your nervous system.  The reduced activity of your nervous system is the reason that people who are very drunk have trouble controlling their movements and may stagger, trip, and slur their words.  Depressive drugs tend to make you feel relaxed, lose, and uninhibited.  It is also why drinking makes many people feel sleepy.  </p>
<p>The opposite of a depressant drug would be a stimulant.  Stimulants make your nervous system work extra hard.  Often stimulants give people extra energy.  Caffine is mild stimulant, while harder drugs like cocaine and amphetamines are also stimulants.  People who take these drugs feel full of energy (one of the original uses of amphetamines was for military anti-tiredness drugs during WWII).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's counter-intuitive, but anxiety and apprehensive/avoidant behavior is actually a sign of an <em>over</em>active nervous system. For every action you think to take your automatic part of your mind is thinking of 10 ways it could go wrong.</p>
<p>Alcohol increases the effect of GABA in your brain - the main inhibitory neurotransmitter. GABA keeps your neurons from communicating with each other as quickly. So instead of finding 10 ways things could go wrong, your brain is only able to come up with one or two ways, and sometimes zero, that things could go wrong.</p>
<p>Depression in terms of neuron communication is not necessarily related to depression in emotional state. Sometimes the more inhibited your neurons are, the less inhibited your behavior will be, and vice versa.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The rest of your brain are the uncensored remains, so you feel better and less restrained. But then if you drink too much, those parts shut down too. That’s not good</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
