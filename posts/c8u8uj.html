		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Lorentz transformations were known for quite a while (2-3 decades) before Einstein, but people were still debating their physicality. That moving objects contract, for one, was already hypothesized to happen because of electromagnetism. The Maxwell equations transform according to special relativity before we knew what that meant, and they predict an object kept together by electromagnetic forces would contract in the direction it is moving. However, this was considered to be a purely kinematic and electromagnetic effect, a consequence of the motion of charges (relative to the ether for example.) An object kept together by different forces might transform entirely differently as far as physicists of that time were concerned.</p>
<p>It took the genius of Einstein to realize that these transformations are how distances and time are intrinsically linked. They are not a consequence of how interactions work, rather, all interactions have to be consistent with them.</p>
<p>Einstein also wasn't the first to come up with a metric theory of gravity. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordstr%C3%B6m%27s_theory_of_gravitation" target="_blank">Nordstr√∂m</a> was one earlier example. Einstein and Hilbert also came up with the Einstein field equations more or less simultaneously. But a lot of the main insights were still his, it still takes a genius to find the simplest theory matching the data and predicting new phenomena.</p>
<p>Neither theory would have laid undiscovered forever without Einstein. But it would have taken us a lot more time. And these are not his only claims to fame, he made half a dozen more genius leaps that were also built upon existing groundwork, but were still novel and brilliant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm more familiar with the science than the history, but I'll give my best understanding.</p>
<p>Special relativity, having the benefit of hindsight, had really been staring scientists in the face for decades by the time Einstein formalized it. Maxwell's equations said the speed of light was constant under all circumstances, experiments showed the speed of light was constant from moving sources, and experiments failed to find evidence for the luminiferous aether. Lorentz transformations were already being used to understand time dilation and length contraction, though in a misguided attempt to fit into the aether hypothesis. Einstein's big step was really just putting all the pieces together and suggesting that there really is no aether, all inertial frames are equivalent, and the speed of light is the same in all of them.</p>
<p>General relativity was more of Einstein's own work. As far as I can tell he developed the equivalence principle, the idea that gravity affects light, and the Einstein field equations mostly independently. Others like Schwarzschild made significant contributions to the field, but the framework was mostly Einstein.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mathematically, Riemann and Minkowski (who had been a teacher of Einstein) had already developed all the mathematics Einstein used, but they were thinking in abstract non-Euclidean spaces without worrying much what that mean for the real world (as good mathematicians do). </p>
<p>The merit of Einstein was realizing that those abstract non-Euclidean spaces were real.</p>
<p>Also, Einstein improved A LOT the notation in this branch of mathematics, I mean, it's still confusing today, but it used to be a lot worse. Improving notation is not usually celebrated, but I think it should.</p>
<p>Finally I should mention that after Einstein published his theory of relativity Minkowski saw how he had used his work and expanded on it to create a better interpretations of what was going on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember on e watching a talk given by a physics nobel price, explaining his experiment and how it worked. He  spent the first part reminding us of several well know quantum physics principles. Then he said : well, the whole trick was to use them like this, and that's how I got my Nobel price.</p>
<p>We were all familiar with these effects. I had heard about them in school. The real genius was to think about the right combination. Plenty of people have had the bricks in front of them for a long time. Nobody ever thought of using them in that specific way. </p>
<p>The groundwork is often very much in place. That doesn't reduce one bit the genius necessary to use it properly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
