		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a combination really. Humans, just like any other animals, have cues that trigger us. We evolved to notice physical trademarks that indicate sexual maturity in others. Things like wider hips, breasts, full lips etc. in a woman for example. It's really no different than, say, a brightly coloured bum indicating the same in a baboon.</p>
<p>We can quite easily tell a child from an adult most of the time. While breast size in women varies, young girls are completely flat, their hips haven't widened, their facial features haven't changed yet. Just like young boys haven't experienced adult muscle growth, the growth of the penis and so on.</p>
<p>But it's also learned behaviour. Culturally we layer beauty ideals on top of that. At different times and in different periods we favoured thick women or thin women, tanned women or pale women and so on. A lifetime of being demonstrated what is supposed to be attractive will shape your perceptions. Cultural biases have left black women underrepresented in Western beauty ideals for a long time for instance.</p>
<p>Another big contributor in the modern world is marketing. Everything around us is monetized and marketing is telling us every waking moment what we should like, love, enjoy, or aspire to be or obtain. It is an industry aimed at ensuring that we don't like or want anything that we could obtain without paying for it. Which is also impacting the beauty ideals we are sexually attracted to.</p>
<p>So the basis is instinctive. We are attracted to certain changes in the body and its chemistry (scents, hormones etc.) but that attraction can be manipulated through the culture and experiences we're exposed to. That's also how fetishes come into being where an association with one feeling (sexual attraction) with another stimulus (pain, feet etc.) will cause us to be aroused by something that is not really part of reproductive sexual attraction.</p>
<p>And if you're wondering, I'm mostly using women as an example because our culture, media and society is much more focused on female sexual attraction than male so it's much easier to point at clear examples. There's been plenty of periods in history where it was the men who preened and displayed rather than the women but people tend to be less familiar with those periods.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember the moment I saw a picture of a full frontal naked girl in a magazine for the first time. I must have been about 13. My first thought was “Wow!!!!“.    My second thought was “How does my brain recognise this hairy weird thing I have never seen before as being incredibly desirable and exciting?”</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans are complicated. When you're thinking about things that humans have in common with other animals, such as sexual reproduction, it's easier to think it through using non-humans.</p>
<p>Doing that, it is clear that the drive to reproduce is guided by the drive for sex. As a general tendency, the simpler the animal, in terms of cognition, the clearer the link between those two drives.</p>
<p>Animals with more complicated social orders are different. When you get to animals with instincts having to do with social bonding, social hierarchy, general curiosity, etc... and the interplay between those instincts and the drive to reproduce makes for some pretty interesting behavior.</p>
<p>Then you get to humans. We don't just have various competing and synergizing instincts; we have culture. That changes everything. </p>
<p>But now you see what makes your question interesting. It isn't that sex is so complicated that it's a wonder it can be dictated by instincts. It's that humans are so complicated that behavior dictated by biological imperatives for other animals become very complicated and sometimes even divorced from those imperatives for us, so much so that humans have sex and use birth control.</p>
<p>A snail can mate guided by instinct alone. We make sex complicated, because we are complicated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>ELI5: It is just how the brain is wired. Visual, hearing, taste and touch can inform preference but it doesn't define sexuality.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I’m struggling to imagine this being real. Like… there’s surely SO many instances this isn’t the case. Surely seeing the genitals of someone you’re not attracted to doesn’t turn you on?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
