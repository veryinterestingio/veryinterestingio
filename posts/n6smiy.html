One thing that struck me was that white objects and mirrors both reflect the whole color spectrum so how come a mirror and a white object look so different.</p>
<p>Edit: thanks to all the people who took time out of their day to answer this question and thanks for the awards</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difference between the two comes from the difference between two types of reflection:</p>
<p><strong>Specular reflection</strong> is what we see in a mirror. Here all light is reflected at the same angle that with which it strikes the surface.</p>
<p><strong>Diffuse reflection</strong> is the other mode of reflection, where the light is scattered as it is reflected and the angle of reflection isn't the same as the angle of incidence.</p>
<p>Most surfaces have some amount of each mode of reflection. For specular reflection, it is necessary that the surface is very smooth. But this isn't the only requirement. Material plays a role too, because some smooth materials (such as polished porcelain or marble) still primarily reflect diffusely.</p>
<p>A white object that primarily has diffuse reflection won't look like a mirror, which will primarily exhibit specular reflection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To &quot;first order&quot; the answer is the difference between specular vs. diffuse reflection as others have said. But I think it's important to note that diffuse scattering is rarely actually a surface effect as so many diagrams show. If it were than very badly scuffed and scratched metal surfaces would look like white paint, but they don't.</p>
<p>Rather the randomizing of angle of light off diffusive surfaces typically comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsurface_scattering" target="_blank">subsurface scattering</a> off inner layers. A better diagram is something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Diffuse_reflection.gif" target="_blank">this</a>. So &quot;white&quot; things tend to be somewhat transparent, letting light inside some amount into their surface, and it's reflections off complex internal structure that leads to the light leaving in a random direction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>So a really cool detail is that, at a steep enough angle, nearly every smooth surface is mirror-reflective!</p>
<p>You can test this by putting your face up against a glass window, or against a shiny plastic surface. Doesn’t matter what color the object is, or what it’s made of, it’ll reflect back like a mirror as long as it’s polished smooth!</p>
<p>Physics is cool.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
