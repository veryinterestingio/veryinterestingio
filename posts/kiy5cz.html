		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Almost all of them <em>do</em>. Very few plants can tolerate being waterlogged, and those that can have specifically evolved to be able to do so. The most common way of doing this is simply to eschew the use of roots entirely, shifting the normal functions (water and nutrient absorption) to other parts of the plant (which works fine, since they're constantly surrounded by water), and using the roots only to anchor to a surface, if they have roots at all. </p>
<p>There are quite a lot of places oxygen is important within the functioning of plant cells, which is why less oxygen is bad, but this also means lots of different opportunities for plants to mutate something more tolerant to low oxygen. If you're interested in learning about these mechanisms, what you'll want to search for is stuff like &quot;adaptations to hypoxia in aquatic plants&quot;. It's cell biology though, not particularly 5-year-old-friendly, and I was struggling to find resources on the topic that were intended to be layman-accessible. Mostly just papers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So they totally do, I started a hydroponics grow in my basement in October and ran into a near-fatal bout of root rot while playing around with my environmental variables.</p>
<p>I had played around with a few different things to try help it and the thing that seems to work is to add beneficial bacteria and mycorrhizals to out compete the bacteria that is causing the root rot.</p>
<p>There are a few different products on the market and I used an approach where I took a little bit of a couple different types and brewed a sort of tea with earth worm castings to sort of 'bloom' the bacteria and get more milage out of the product. </p>
<p>I'm about 8 days out from losing 90+% of my root mass and 80~% of my canopy but things seem to have stabilized and they're coming back to life now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like most of the answers in this thread are underselling the difference between soil and pure water here.  While it's certainly true that plants in water can still get root rot it's less common than plants in overwatered soil, and there's a big difference in typical oxygen levels between the two.  </p>
<p>There are basically two factors behind this. </p>
<p>First is the physical nature of the soil vs a container of water.  Soil particles hinder the physical movement of water and the stuff dissolved in it around the container.  Oxygen diffuses in at the surface, but oxygen can't move down to where the roots are as easily because it has to wind its way through channels between soil particles.  </p>
<p>Second is the action of the life in the soil.  Soil generally contains a ton of microorganisms...bacteria, fungi, etc.  As they break down organic material in the soil, they use oxygen.  In muddy soil they can rapidly use up <em>all</em> the oxygen in the soil, meaning the only oxygen is in the thin surface layer.  In relatively pure water there are many fewer microorganisms active and so oxygen is used up much more slowly, leaving more for the roots of plants.</p>
<p>Also, it's worth noting that different plants have different root requirements.  Marsh plants can grow in straight mud and actually pipe oxygen down to their roots through hollow channels in the roots.  Some plants can't grow in mud but do fine in a glass of water.  And some need more oxygen delivered to the roots than you get without aerating the water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
