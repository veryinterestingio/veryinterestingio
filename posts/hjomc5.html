		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reading is a very passive way to experience language: the words are already there for you with correct spelling and correct syntax/grammar. All you have to do is recognize the words (or even part of words) and you can guess the meaning of a whole sentence.</p>
<p>Speaking is a much more active process: not only do you have to come up with the words but you have to pronounce them correctly and use correct syntax/grammar. So it's way easier to guess the meaning of words you are somewhat familiar with, than it is to come up with these words in the right order on your own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh I think I know this one! You have a higher receptive vocabulary then expressive vocabulary when you’re learning a new language. Listening and comprehension come before being able to speak. Many EL (English language learners) will go through what’s called the “silent period” where they may understand the vast majority of what is being spoken before they will speak themselves. Same is true for other languages I assume.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>
<p>people don’t speak as slowly as you’d read a language you don’t know well</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>accents. there are even native italians who say they can’t understand sicilian italian, so imagine how tough it would be for you to listen to words being spoken much more differently than you learned them</p>
</li>
<li>when people speak, they typically get a bit lazy with formation. say things that aren’t 100% grammatically correct, and oral language typically has far more slang/dialectal phrases than written language has.</li>
