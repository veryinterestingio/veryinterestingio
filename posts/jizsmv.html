		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked for a major battery manufacturer.</p>
<p>There are 4 standard types of consumer household batteries. Alkaline, carbon-zinc, rechargeable, and lithium.</p>
<p>The basic differences are construction of the interior of the battery, from chemicals, to material layout, to the nail (positive terminal), caps (seals for the edges of the cylinder).  The combination of these differences can affect voltage, life, leaking (acid spilling out of a dormant battery), it's ability to function at different temperatures and more. </p>
<p>Carbon zinc is what you'll find in a lot of very cheap batteries. Eveready is the most well known brand of carbon-zinc and can be found in private label batteries and outside the US. You usually do not want these.</p>
<p>Alkaline is the most common, such as Duracell Coppertop/Ultra and Energizer MAX. This is a chemical component but much of their construction can also affect how a battery works. Typically Duracell might have a bit more juice than Energizer, but it decreases faster. They also historically leak due to poor seals. Energizer MAX has not been as powerful but as it's life goes on, it holds its charge better than Duracell.</p>
<p>In real world terms, Duracell might make your light a little brighter at first, but you may notice Energizer keeps it bright longer, or continues to work better in a low drain device like a clock or remote. So there are advantages to both.  How many you actually notice will vary GREATLY due to so many different factors. </p>
<p>When you see alkaline terms like ultra VS copper top or advanced VS max, it's typically a mechanical change inside the battery. It may hold chemicals in packed rings instead of a long cell for instance, which allows for more power-providing chemicals inside the cell. </p>
<p>Rechargeable is similar, with a lot of complications on cycles, charge times, milliamperage, etc. I won't go into detail here.</p>
<p>Lithium is an Energizer offering. They last longer and have many advantages over alkaline. Higher power output at sustained levels, they don't leak like alkaline do, they operate in colder Temps, etc.</p>
<p>Don't buy cheapo batteries folks. You really do get what you pay for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different brands will have different standards for their internal process.</p>
<p>It means they allow have different tolerances for quality assurance, for example, so even if two products use the exact same raw materials, they can last shorter or longer depending on <em>how</em> they were made.</p>
<p>Other reasons for a different price may include anything related to sustainability (like using recyclable materials, even if it's only on the package itself) and being made on developing countries (where the man-hour is more expensive than cheap labour on underdeveloped countries).</p>
<p>And that's not to mention the strategic reasons for picking a different price. A company may decide to release their product at a higher price just to give the illusion of higher quality.</p>
<p>Edit: I realized I answered in a general way, not specific to batteries, sorry! I hope it can still help you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Please please take away from this that you should be using rechargeable batteries for 95% of your battery use.</p>
<p>Eneloop are awesome, but many others are great as well.  I first got some Eneloops almost 15 years ago.  I have only disposed of a small handful, most still hold a great charge.  I grew up using garbage Radio Shack rechargeable batteries, and they were horrid!  If your experience with rechargeable batteries is pre 2000, give them another shot, you’ll be surprised.  We probably have 60 or so AA, and 40 or so AAA, and they’ve paid for themselves ten times over.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of the difference between batteries is simply branding. For instance, the difference between Energizer and Energizer Industrial is simply the packaging.  However, there are several different battery types that do have a significant difference in performance.</p>
<p>The lowest grade of batteries are Zinc-Carbon. These are not terribly common anymore and really will only be found as the cheapest of the cheap off-brands.  They usually contain 400-900mAh of charge.</p>
<p>The next lowest grade are Zinc-Chloride, which are often called &quot;heavy duty&quot; batteries. These are the cheap bulk ones you get at the dollar store and the kind that come preinstalled in low-end electronics. They generally hold 1000-1500mAh of charge and are called heavy duty despite having less charge than the more common Alkaline batteries because back when they were first invented, Zinc-Carbon batteries were the norm.  </p>
<p>The most common AA batteries are Alkaline. That's what regular old Energizer or Duracell are. They can hold anywhere from 1700-2850mAh depending on their formulation, so that's where you will see the difference between same-brand labeling like Energizer vs. Energizer Max, where both are Alkaline but the Max has a formulation that allows the battery to hold more charge.  </p>
<p>Then you get into the high end batteries like Lithium Iron Disulfide, which are more expensive but hold an even higher charge, generally 3000mAh or more.  </p>
<p>Basically, to know which kind of battery you are getting regardless of the branding, read the packaging.  It should tell you both the type of battery and the mAh rating, so even if it says &quot;ultra&quot; or &quot;super long lasting,&quot; if it has a low mAh rating you'll know the battery is no good.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
