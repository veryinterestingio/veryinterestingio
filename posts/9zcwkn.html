		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Osmosis mostly. </p>
<p>Osmosis is what happens when two water solutions of different concentrations of solvents are separated by a water permeable membrane. The water moves through the membrane to equalize the concentrations in the two solutions.</p>
<p>Honey is a solution with a very high concentration of sugars in it. </p>
<p>Bacteria and other microbes are filled with water that contains a smaller concentration of dissolved substances.</p>
<p>Cell membranes surrounding microbes are water permeable.</p>
<p>so when a microbe contacts the honey, a water permeable membrane separates a high concentration solution(honey) from a lower concentration solution(microbe cytoplasm) and the water will move in such a way to equalize the difference. Out of the microbe, drying it out.</p>
<p>Honey is also slightly acidic and contains some hydrogen peroxide but those are small factors.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Honey is a desert for microbes that sucks them dry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bees are working quite hard to make their honey a very hostile environment for microorganisms. There are, at least, <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-science-behind-honeys-eternal-shelf-life-1218690/?no-ist" target="_blank">three things that help preserve the honey</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The high sugar content makes it very hydrophilic, so it will dry out any microorganism</li>
<li>It has a low PH, and the acidity breaks down microorganisms</li>
<li>It is mixed with enzymes producing hydrogen peroxide, which has a strong oxidizing effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>These three factors combined ensures honey have such a long shelf life. Still, it will spoil, eventually, if exposed to enough moisture. That's how you make mead after all.</p>
<p>There are a few bacteria associated with honey. One of the more nasty ones is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_botulinum" target="_blank">Clostridium botulinum</a> which produces the toxin which causes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botulism" target="_blank">botulism</a>. This is the reason that small children shouldn't eat honey.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The water content of honey is a key factor in why it doesn't spoil. At 17%, its water content is much lower than that of bacteria or fungi. Honey also has a low water activity; this is a measure of the amount of water in a substance that is available to support microbial growth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have pointed out honey is monstrously &quot;dry&quot; due to being about 80% sugars by mass.</p>
<p>I'll add that honey is also incredibly stable over time due to it's composition. There's no fats to go rancid, few proteins to break down, and even the sugars are largely stable simple sugars.</p>
<p>Honey is basically too dry for microbes, and too simple for time to break it down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing that i haven't seen mentioned is water activity. Water activity is the measurable amount of water in something that is free to used. It is given as the relative percent compared to pure water i.e. .80 for 80% .60 for 60% ect. Without enough free water no microbiological growth can happen. Honey doesn't have enough free water in it for anything to grow. Add enough water and yiy get mead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
