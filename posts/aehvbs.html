		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, between different fuel types, premium gas, regular gas (87,93)</p>
<p>Basically, the cylinders in each engine compresses the fuel/air mixture to a certain amount, the more compressed the mixture, the hotter it gets and more likely it is to explode.</p>
<p>however, sometimes, if the fuel explodes before the correct time (when the pistol is at it's highest position) that is bad for the engine, so a higher octane fuel (93 is higher than 87), it's less likely to explode before the spark caused by the spark plug.
performance and turbo cars usually have higher compression ratios, meaning the air/fuel mixture is compressed tighter, requiring a higher octane fuel to avoid that early, spontaneous ignition.</p>
<p>now gasoline vs diesel.</p>
<p>these are 2 different types of fuel, but to get to the point.</p>
<p>gasoline requires a spark plug to generate a spark and ignite, diesel on the other hand doesn't, and can be ignited safely and reliably on compression alone.</p>
<p>they aren't interchangeable due to the technology required for each to run optimally on each engine. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The way an engine produced power, is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>SUCK</strong></p>
<p>The vacuum created by the piston moving down the in the cylinder, and being sealed against the cylinder wall (by piston rings) draws air and fuel mixture into the open valves. </p>
<p><strong>SQUEEZE</strong></p>
<p>As the crank continues to rotate, the camshafts rotate also, allowing the valves to be closed (via the valve springs). This seals the cylinder, and then the piston starts to move back up the cylinder, compressing the mixture, which also makes it more volatile. </p>
<p><strong>BANG</strong></p>
<p>When the cylinder reaches TDC (Top dead center) or close to it, the ECU sends a message to the spark plug to ignite the now compressed mixture. The ignition from the spark plug, ignites the mixture causing the nitrogen in the air within the mixture to expand very quickly, pushing the piston back down the cylinder and generating force, and output which spins the crankshaft.  </p>
<p><strong>BLOW</strong></p>
<p>As the piston starts to move back up the cylinder, the camshafts spin and open the exhaust valve(s). The pressure of the piston displacing the now exhausted mixture in the cylinder pushes the waste gas out of the exhaust valves. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This then repeats. This is a very basic explanation of the four stroke cycle. You may have to google some pictures for this to make sense, or better still, go on youtube and watch a working model of an engine. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now... on to Octane ratings. </p>
<p>The higher the octane rating of fuel, the less volatile it is. As pressure is produced by the piston, it also generates in cylinder heat. If too low octane fuel is used, in a high compression engine, the heat produced by this pressure will ignite the mixture before the spark plug has a chance to. This is known as pre-ignition. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Pre-ignition (or pinking) is terrible for the engine, because it effectively tries to push the piston back down the cylinder, while it is still travelling upwards. Think of pushing directly downwards on a bike's pedal before your foot has passed the top center point of a rotation. </p>
<p>This can damage the pistons (usually the 'lands' that the piston rings sit on) and cause catastrophic engine failure., or at the very least, a severe loss of compression. </p>
<p>Different engine's have different compression ratios. This means that they 'Squeeze' the air within the cylinder by a different amount. A high performance vehicle will have a high compression ratio (around 10 or 11:1). Whereas a low performance vehicle will have a low compression ratio (maybe between 6-8:1) and therefore doesn't require protection against pre-ignition in the form of high octane fuel. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Hopefully this makes sense, if not, let me know and i will try to follow up. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The two answers posted are close but not quite 100%. The main issue caused by low octane fuel is not pre ignition  but detonation (knocking). The difference is small on the surface but is actually quite large.</p>
<p>Pre ignition is when the fuel /air charge ignites before the spark event even happens. The spark is supposed to happen about 20-30 degrees before top dead centre, to give the flame time to reach the top of the piston by the time the piston is at top dead centre (tdc). Common causes of pinging are hot spots, carbon build up, and to hot of spark plugs. This condition is extremely destructive.</p>
<p>Detonation (knocking) on the other hand occurs once the spark event has already happened. When the fuel /air charge is ignited, it should burn smoothly in the combustion chamber. If the pressure/heat in the combustion chamber rises to quickly (say from high compression or to advanced of a spark) the mixture may then explode instead of a controlled burn.</p>
<p>You can fix this several ways. You could decrease compression to safe levels, or retard your spark (this is what your knock sensors do, and what allows modem engines to run on a wide range of octane ratings), but both of these will decrease performance. Instead you can run a higher octane fuel so that it will resist exploding once it is already ignited.</p>
<p>Detonation isn't as destructive as preignition, but over time can destroy an engine and should be avoided as much as possible. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
