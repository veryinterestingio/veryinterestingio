He noticed that at the place where it broke, the transparent pink plastic became opaque white. Why does that happen (instead of it remaining transparent throughout)?</p>
<p>This is best illustrated by the pic I took of the <a href="https://imgur.com/S8rasqb" target="_blank">broken pen</a>.</p></div></div>

<p>Plastics are made of polymers, which are long molecules, all entangled together - imagine cooked spaghetti. In this state, the material is see-through. This is known as amorphous, and is the reason glass is see-through too.</p>
<p>When you bend the plastic, you stress these polymer chains and stretch them out. This allows them to align together, imagine raw spaghetti. In this state, the polymer chains can crystallise, and this blocks light.</p>
<p>Crystallisation is essentially just the process of creating an ordered structure of atoms or molecules.</p>
<p>To prove this, try heating the plastic up a bit, and see if it goes transparent again. The heat allows the chains to move back into their relaxed position.</p>

<p>EDIT: Seems most of these other answers are contradictory, shows how misinformation can spread. Best is to just read up yourself: <a href="https://www.polymersolutions.com/blog/why-does-plastic-turn-white-stress/" target="_blank">https://www.polymersolutions.com/blog/why-does-plastic-turn-white-stress/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably a combination of 2 things</p>
<ol>
<li>The broken side isn't smooth any more. Rough surfaces get hazy since they diffuse light that passes through them.</li>
<li>Plastic tends to bend before it breaks. When it bends, it's ripping apart in a bunch of tiny cracks which traps air. These gaps and air bubbles diffuse light similar to reason #1</li>
</ol>
<p>Source: I am a programmer and 3D artist who deals with surface materials and light transport equations for most of my day. Basically I get paid to ask the question &quot;Why did the pen turn opaque when it broke,&quot; and re-create it üòÅ</p>
<p>EDIT: I didn't think I would have to explain this, but a lot of you seem to be confused what the term &quot;Artist,&quot; means. I do a lot of product visualization, which means making things <em>look</em> photorealistic. I do this by understanding <em>common surface properties</em> that apply in a lot of cases and applying them in practice to reach the desired result. While this leads me to have a more in depth knowledge of surface behavior than the average person, I am not a molecular scientist, nor do I claim to be hence why literally the first word of this post is &quot;Probably.&quot; While there weren't when I originally posted, there are currently much better answers here now, so to those people who's day this post apparently ruined, I hope you have a better day from this point forward üòä</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plastics are made up of chains of molecules, when you stretch them, the molecules align, allowing bonding between the chains, this is crystallization, and results in opaqueness. In addition, when stretching the plastic on a microscopic level, voids form (this is crazing) these voids also result in opaqueness, so what you are seeing is a combination of the two effects. Even if the plastic doesn‚Äôt seem deformed on a macro level, it has been severely traumatized on a micro level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plastic polymers are structures of relatively ordered chains of hydrocarbons.</p>
<p>When you put stress on this structure, you're breaking apart molecular bonds in those chains, causing them to form small void spaces in the structure as they're displaced and rearranged. These voids refract light differently than the rest of the structure, causing the opacity you observe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Fun experiment. Go find a plastic shopping grocery bag. stretch the bag and watch it turn white.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
