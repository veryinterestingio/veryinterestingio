Throughout the day the customers ruffle through the neatly folded clothes, try them on and put them down somewhere else. Completely disorganizing the entire store. </p>
<p>That is you using your battery.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the employees run through using their tiny hands to pick up crumpled clothes, fold them, and reorganize the entire store. </p>
<p>That is the charging. </p>
<p>The electrons come in through the wall, reorganize your lithium ions and leave.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You would see equal numbers of electrons flowing from and returning to the source, out from the negative and into the positive wires, respectively. They hop across valence orbitals through a lattice of metal atoms that make up the wires. They also move surprisingly slowly - the rate at which electric pressure is felt on the other end of a wire is very fast, but the electrons themselves only move around 10mm/sec.</p>
<p>Inside the battery you would see electrons hopping off one electrode and onto a molecule, destabilizing it and causing part of it to rearrange in a fashion that transports an electron through the electrolyte. Generally speaking, charging the battery would have the same effect but in the opposite direction, re-forming the original molecules in the electrolyte.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you could zoom on the cable you would see a flow of electrons from the positive pod of the battery to the negative, in it's way activating said device.</p>
<p>See it like a stream of water : your charged battery is like a 2 parts pressurised water tank, one full and one empty.
Discharge : When you plug something the stream of water give some energy to your device and the water end in the empty part of the tank.
Empty : When you do not have enough pressure left you can't activate your device anymore
Charge : with an external source of energy you move the water back in the first part of your tank an rise the pressure again, you can now use the battery/tank again</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
