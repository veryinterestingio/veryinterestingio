		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The filmmakers typically have to take way more film than fit in a normal documentary format. but that normal documentary format was truncated due to attention span that movie theater goers set as standard.</p>
<p>Now that the media formats like DVD etc don't constrain the movie length limit. Now that broadcasters don't have to block out 1 and 2 hour time slots. Now that people can stream. The documentaries are hitting a more natural length.</p>
<p>Plus with advertising and all that, a longer show pays better.</p>
<p>So it's not so much there stretching out the content as it is they are no longer condensing the content.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think &quot;so many&quot; are. In fact these long form, multi hour documentaries are pretty rare in the media.  Its really really hard to get something like that funded, let alone spend the epic amount of time needed to produce on of that length.</p>
<p>Most documentaries are pretty short, generally just small docs of say 20-30 minutes, or even less.  A full length documentary movie is generally under 90 minute (70 minutes is a good length). For something interesting, it can often take 2-5 years to put together a full length, 70-80 minute documentary film. Probably as you and many others full time job. For years. People will sometimes work on a 20-30 minute doc for an entire year.</p>
<p>There's a somewhat related thing, that maybe this is what you're getting at that is called, simply for marketing purposes &quot;docuseries&quot; but are actually just reality TV shows. Now there are actual docuseries that are not just reality TV, think like National Geographic channel, Animal planet shows, Travel shows, and such, but there is some trashy reality trying to co-op the docuseries name too.  The OJ Simpson ESPN one and recent The Last Dance (also ESPN) are good examples of a docuseries that isn't reality. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Burns" target="_blank">Ken Burns</a> is a famous documentarian who does really really long form documentaries over stuff like 10 hours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's about money, driven by SVOD (subscription video on demand services, like Netflix) and AVOD (ad-supported video on demand, like YouTube). SVODs count on 'time spent' with their service as one metric to keep subscribers.  AVOD uses 'time spent' as a metric for advertisers.  </p>
<p>The craft of well-edited, concise storytelling goes out of the equation when docs are monetized. The longer, the better - and now stuff that once wound up on the cutting room floor is included. They all benefit from bloated content, but not viewers. </p>
<p>We can complain about the rigid 23- and 45-minute and 3 or 5 arc structure on ad-supported tv, but the editing did cut bloat.  Producers/directors had to be disciplined in their storytelling in that model.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
