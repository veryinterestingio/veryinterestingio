<p>There was extreme flooding in my area last year and there were videos of fishing literally swimming across a road.</p>
<p>Edit:
Some people are saying this is crazy. I guess one responder even tried to say it's crazy and insinuated that nature couldn't do this and it had to be God or something...</p>
<p>Here's video evidence of this sort of thing happening.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63Xs3Hi-2OU" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63Xs3Hi-2OU</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a few ways. Someone mentioned eggs sticking to aquatic bird legs. Also, some amphibians can travel decent distances over land, and mud/dirt stuck to them will contain eggs. There's also storms, which can whip up water, create waterspouts, and move live fish over short distances from lake to lake. You hear the odd story about rains of frogs and fish.</p>
<p>Bodies of water are frequently connected via streams and rivers.</p>
<p>I'd bet you a dollar, though I have no evidence, that First Nations also seeded fish in lakes actively.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fish eggs are slightly sticky. Bird lands in existing lake, picks up eggs (sticks to legs). Flys to next water body, eggs fall off.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>PBS had a great documentary on the Great Lakes. As a Michigander I was surprised to find out that quite a few species in the Great Lakes  were brought from out West, stocked for sport fishing. I recall the doc mentioning Salmon and certain Trout were non native to the lakes. During their efforts, they managed to screw up the whole ecosystem? of the Great Lakes system on a few different occasions. The way we know them today is quite far from where nature would have put them. I agree with the other responses as well, but didnâ€™t see this one mentioned.</p>
<p>Edited to add that the doc is called Making Waves</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
