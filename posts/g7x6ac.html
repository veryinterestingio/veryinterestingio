		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that Metallic Hydrogen could be the best rocket fuel ever with currently feasible technology. There are several important qualities of a rocket fuel, the three most important in order being the amount of energy per kilogram of fuel (Energy Mass Density), amount of energy per unit volume (Volumetric Energy Density) and ease of use/storage. The total energy in the fuel dictates how far a rocket can go, so more is always better for the same weight, volume, and complexity</p>
<p>The most common rocket fuel called Kerolox, is actually a pair of fluids - Kerosene and Liquid oxygen. This combination is a good balance of energy mass density, energy per volume, and kerosene is very easy to handle but Liquid oxygen must be stored at or below its boiling point at -297.3°F which is a engineering challenge but not impossible.</p>
<p>However, some rockets (like the Delta 4 Heavy or some upper stages) use hydrolox - Liquid Hydrogen and Liquid Oxygen. This combination has the max energy per kilogram of any current fuel-oxidizer pair. However, Liquid hydrogen is not volumetrically very dense so tanks must be physically larger for the same amount of energy. In addition it must be stored at or below -423.2°F which is a bigger challenge. On top of this, hydrogen molecules are small enough to flow/diffuse into the metals of the tanks, weakening them through hydrogen embrittlement - another engineering challenge. However, if you need the performance sometimes the price is worth paying.</p>
<p>Metallic Hydrogen brings with it all the chemical energy of liquid hydrogen with several other benefits. To create it, you must compress it with immense pressures - like those in the cores of gas giants like Jupiter. Some research suggests that metallic hydrogen is &quot;metastable&quot; meaning that when you release the pressure it stays compressed, bound together by the attractions between atoms like a stuck spring. This means that you don't need to maintain the pressure to store it and when you destabilize it (aka explode it), you get back all of the stored mechanical energy - which is 10-12 times the chemical energy of burning, and as the results of the explosion are high energy/pressure hydrogen molecules, you can burn those too with liquid oxygen to get all the chemically energy.</p>
<p>The only downside of it, just like Graphene or Room Temperature Superconductors, is we don't know how to make it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An actual ELI5</p>
<p>We have solids, liquids and gasses in the universe (plus some more under special circumstances). Not every atom can be all three though. When you cool down a gas it turns into a liquid, when you cool down a liquid it turns into a solid.</p>
<p>For the smaller atoms, we can cool them down to nearly absolute zero degrees, the coldest temperature possible, and they still don’t turn into a solid, they start doing other things as a liquid instead.</p>
<p>Hydrogen is one of those atoms that just cooling it down doesn’t turn it into a solid. However, you can also add lots of pressure to something to make it turn into a solid and that’s what they’re excited about with metallic hydrogen because it shows you can make a solid out of hydrogen. Once it’s a metal it’s able to stay that way until you want to release it. 1g of metallic hydrogen would be the same as 24L of gaseous hydrogen (at room temperature and pressure). This means for making rocket fuel, the amount of fuel you can put on a rocket increases dramatically when you have it as a solid instead of a liquid because it doesn’t take up much volume as a solid and is easy to store. (Gaseous hydrogen likes to absorb into the sides of its tank and stay there)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Each atom of hydrogen wants to be stuck to another atom of hydrogen. Spaceflight enthusiasts are hoping that the structure of metallic hydrogen will trap the atoms far enough apart that they can't stick, and that releasing them slowly from the structure will make them get really hot as they find partner atoms. Something that gets that hot on command would be a great rocket fuel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
