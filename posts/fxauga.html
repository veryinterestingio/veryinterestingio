<p>(American rules) Let's say your mom accidentally breaks your favorite, one-of-a-kind toy. &quot;I'm so sorry,&quot; she says, &quot;but all I have to make it up to you is cookies.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; you say, &quot;then give me 50 cookies!&quot; That toy meant a lot to you, and you want everyone to know it.</p>
<p>Now it doesn't matter if your mom doesn't have 50 cookies. Maybe she only has 10 cookies. At the time you ask for 50 cookies, you don't know how many cookies she really has. Maybe in the future she'll get more cookies! But anyways, no one ever got MORE cookies than they asked for (especially from a mom who really doesn't want to give you any of her cookies). So you play it smart and ask for a whole lot of cookies.</p>
<p>So your mom says,&quot;50 cookies? That's crazy! Your stupid toy wasn't even worth anything. No cookies for you!&quot;</p>
<p>Now you go to dad, who will decide how many cookies your toy was worth. You and mom both tell your side of the story. In the end, dad says, &quot;Kid, your toy was worth 30 cookies, and mom has to give them to you. Here, I'll write that on a piece of paper.&quot; He does so, and then he signs it. &quot;There.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where do I go to collect my 30 cookies,&quot; you ask dad. &quot;Kid,&quot; your dad says, &quot;my job isn't to go get the cookies from mom and give them to you. I just decide what your toy was worth. But if mom gives you a hard time, come on back and see me and I'll try to help you out.&quot;</p>
<p>So now you take your paper back to mom and demand your 30 cookies. &quot;Tough,&quot; she says. &quot;I only have 10 cookies, and I've hidden them. You could spend a lot of time looking for them, or I could give you eight cookies now, and we'll consider the whole thing settled.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Eight cookies!&quot; you think. &quot;I'll bet she's fibbing about having only 10 cookies. And I know for a fact that her job at the bakery give her 1 cookie a week. No way am I  only going to take eight cookies!&quot;</p>
<p>So you go back to dad and tell him that mom won't give you the 30 cookies he said she owes you. Dad is a little mad because he already did a lot of work to figure out your toy was worth 30 cookies, and now he wants to take a nap. So he says, &quot;Here is a 'wage assignment.&quot; Give this to her boss, Mr. Baker, at the bakery. It says that if he was going to give her 1 cookie, now he has to give you 25% of it. She keeps the rest.&quot;</p>
<p>So you do that. Now every week Mr. Baker sends you one-quarter of a cookie. Even though it's better than nothing, it sure is slow! It will take forever to get to 30 cookies!</p>
<p>So you go back to dad. &quot;Dad, I just know mom has some cookies in her cookie jars, and she's not giving them to me!&quot; He says, &quot;Here is a 'bank levy.' It's a special pass that lets you open up all of mom's cookie jars and take whatever cookies are in there, up to 30 cookies.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Even if she doesn't want me to?&quot; you ask.</p>
<p>&quot;Yep.&quot;</p>
<p>So you march back in to the kitchen and look in all of mom's cookie jars and...</p>
<p>She's moved all her cookies!</p>
<p>Now you use another cool trick. You make mom swear to tell the truth, and you ask her, &quot;Where did you put the cookies?&quot;</p>
<p>Mom says, &quot;Well, I only had 10. I gave four of them to Barbara. Maybe she'll try to sell them at a bake sale, I don't know. But dad's order says *I* owe you the cookies, not Barbara. So there's nothing you can do to her. The other six cookies...&quot; she says, her eyes casually wandering around the room, &quot;I guess I just ate them.&quot; She gives you a half smile that says, &quot;You will never, ever, get your 30 cookies.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gosh,&quot; you think,&quot;this is harder than I thought. At least my note saying she owes me the cookies is good for a looooong time. Maybe if some day she forgets about it, and maybe inherits a bunch of cookies from Grandma, I can do another &quot;bank levy&quot; and look in her cookie jars before she has a chance to hide the cookies.&quot; </p>
<p>You go back to dad one last time. &quot;Isn't there any other way for me to get the cookies I'm owed?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry, kid,&quot; Dad says. &quot;Trust me, I know. Karen can be a real bitch.&quot;</p>
<p>So, kid, when your friend asks you, &quot;Why did you ask for 50 cookies?&quot;, you tell him that you rarely get more than what you ask for, so why not &quot;go big,&quot; as you kids today say. When he asks, &quot;So who is going to pay you your cookies?&quot;, you tell him that only mom is responsible for paying...if you figure out a way of making her.</p>
<p>&quot;Next time,&quot; you think, &quot;I'm going to make sure that before I sue someone, I'll make sure they've got enough cookies (in places I can easily find) to pay me.&quot; <sigh></p>
<p>Walking back from the mailbox, you see you received an invoice from your attorney...</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok INAL but an ELI5 explanation is</p>
<ol>
<li>A lawsuit starts with a &quot;complaint&quot; and the complaint can say they're suing for literally any amount of money without any connection to reality</li>
<li>After a civil trial, the plaintiff could lose and get nothing or the defendant could be found liable</li>
<li>If the defendant is found liable, then the judge or jury has to decide the appropriate amount  of &quot;damages,' or money.</li>
<li>They do that by looking at what the plaintiff can <em>prove</em> using <em>evidence</em>, not whatever they think they should get or what they wrote on their complaint.</li>
<li>The judge orders the defendant to pay the damages, and it's the plaintiff's problem to &quot;enforce the judgment&quot; if the defendant doesn't just pay it voluntarily</li>
<li>Enforcing the judgment could be garnishing the defendant's wages, putting a lien on their assets, having the local sheriff seize their assets</li>
<li>The defendant can delay or block some or all of these things by filing bankruptcy either before or after the judgment</li>
