<p>Until relatively recently, western countries had younger populations so our economies evolved around that, industrialization and baby boom guaranteed a steady supply of babies. But now, if we keep getting older and older, we will need to change our economies around that and/or incentivize people to woo hoo more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The easiest way to grow an economy is to simply increase the number of people.  More humans = more production and more consumption.</p>
<p>Much of the modern global economic system is designed around a basic “there will be more ____ later” assumption.</p>
<p>There will be more money later so you shouldn’t hold cash.</p>
<p>There will be more young people later to cover your retirement.</p>
<p>There will be more sales later to continue growing the company so you should invest now.</p>
<p>If these assumptions collapse, then you have to grapple with aging population and stagnant growth issues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lets take the UK for example. We have an ageing population meaning there are more elderly, retired people than young workers. Because of small birth rates, less people are working which means less money to take care of the elderly. This is why the UK accepts a lot of migrants</p>
<p>Essentially, a higher birth rate means there will be more people who are able to pay taxes that benifit the people and/or the country. A small birth rate is also bad news for businesses who may not get enough customers or employees. These are called economical and social impacts</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It takes more than one person to support each older person in the population. So a steady or shrinking rate will lead to less people to care for older adults and a shrinking economy to pay for other things.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think there's generally considered to be a problem with flat population growth. The problem with a declining birth rate is that, down the line, older people will make up a far bigger % of the population. The working age population basically supports children and the retired population in any country. When you have fewer working age people and more old people, it becomes very difficult to sustain the level of economic output, spending on health and social care, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
