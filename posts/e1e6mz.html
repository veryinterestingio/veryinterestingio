		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5: same reason you don't jog/run everywhere and choose to walk.</p>
<p>They could make every cpu run at its maximum stable speeds, but it is harder on the chips, they will consume more power and generate more heat, and they won't last as long. By having them run at a comfortable speed (like jogging), that's less than their maximum potential they are able to run more efficiently and last much longer.</p>
<p>Sure you can manually tell them to go faster, but at the added cost of power, heat, and reduced lifespan.</p>
<p>Edit: some people are pointing out the lifespan comment. So to continue with ELI5: a Profesional football player will often retire well before they get &quot;old&quot;. They can, and often will live a full life like the rest of us. However all that early life hard work and stress can lead to more health problems later in life that they wouldn't have had otherwise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When companies make a batch of CPUs, they then test them to determine how fast they can reliably operate, which is called &quot;binning&quot;.</p>
<p>Sometimes (particularly after a given processor has been in production for awhile and all the wrinkles are ironed out of the manufacturing process), they end up having lots of processors that can achieve top-shelf speeds.  More in fact, than there is demand for.  So some of those really good chips will be labeled, boxed, and sold as lesser chips that customers are wanting, even though they're actually capable of more.  Overclocking unlocks that greater potential.</p>
<p>In addition to that, it's often possible to wring additional performance out of chips by using non-standard settings, such as adjusting timings or increasing voltage.  These have disadvantages (e.g. higher voltage means it will run hotter and consume more power), so these aren't the stock settings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to all the other comments about engineering tolerances and tradeoffs  it is worthwhile selling the same thing at different price points: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discrimination" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price\_discrimination" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price\_discrimination</a></a></p>
<p>The price is not determined by the cost of manafacture (except inasmuch as you generally don't want to sell at a loss) but what people will pay for it.</p>
<p>You might produce something at a cost of £3. If you have 1000 people who will pay £5, 100 who can will pay £10 and 10 who will pay £50 you don't want to sell to them all at any of those price points - you want everyone to pay they max they are willing to.</p>
<p>The people who pay £50 will buy the £5 version if they can without too much trouble (hence vouchers/coupons and student discounts) but probably won't if it is (or is seen to be) a little inferior (hence gold-plating/limited editions).</p>
<p>It can even be rational to deliberately spoil or mislabel some of your output to sell at the low price point, so those people won't buy it for £5.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Overclocking CPUs make them produce more heat. And it can get dangerous if the computer doesn't have a proper cooling/ventilation system. The manufacturer can't ensure the consumers' computer to have a good enough cooler to handle the overclocked chip. So they keep it at a base level to ensure safety and longer lifetime of the chip</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
