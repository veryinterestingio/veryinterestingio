<p>What would these have been like to cross? Would they have looked like former seabeds, or would they be marshy lowlands, or would you not be able to tell you were on one at all?</p>
<p>Edit: many people seem to be assuming that this question is about one specific land bridge that connected East Asia to The Americas. I was asking about land bridges in general, not this specific one</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a decent amount of paleo environmental reconstructions for the Beringia land-bridge. From pollen assemblages, we know that there was a relatively varied set of landscapes including woodland, brush, steppe and tundra (e.g., <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123558602500193" target="_blank">Young, 1982</a>). Especially toward the end of the existence of the landbridge, there was a decent amount of wetland as represented by peats and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermokarst" target="_blank">thermokarst</a> lakes (e.g., <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033589411001001" target="_blank">Lozhkin et al, 2011</a>). In many ways, these areas would not have been terribly distinct from other arctic environments, though as highlighted in Young, the land bridge area likely had relatively warm summers (for that latitude, during a glacial period at least).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on where you mean.  The land would be as the climate would allow.  Doggerland (now under the North Sea) was forested in large part, apparently.  Effectively not much different from the adjoining lands which did not flood when the ice melted.  I think that similar cases have been made for the southeast Asia regions.</p>
<p>The land does not really know that it ought to be flooded.  It just knows the climate and gets invaded by whatever can handle living in that climate, of course taking into consideration the nature of the soils and so on that always applies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a very interesting question, I wonder if people would build on those land bridges to live there? Also how would those land bridges look nowadays after climate change or could a ice age “revert” climate change and reduce the rising sea levels significantly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>They might not have even realized they just discovered a new world. They just hunted the heards across the northern Pacific.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
