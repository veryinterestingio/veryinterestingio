		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's a bit of both. There are smells which generally provoke disgust in everybody, things like vomit and rotting corpses. However, these innate reactions can be overridden by learned behaviour if those smells become associated with things that our body rewards us for, such as food or sex.</p>
<p>For example, the smell of vomit comes from butyric acid. But butyric acid also gives Parmesan cheese its characteristic smell. In <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/p3179" target="_blank">one study</a>, they got subjects to smell something and primed them with a label, for example, telling them it was either cheese or vomit, and this changed the pleasantness rating of the smell given by the participants.</p>
<p>For another example, chemicals like putrescine and cadaverine give rotting flesh its putrid smell. Nearly all mammals are repulsed by this smell, because it is an indicator of disease. In rats they will <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4551835/" target="_blank">avoid the smell</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>brief exposure to putrescine (vs. ammonia and a scentless control condition) prompted participants to walk away faster from the exposure site</p>
<p>research suggests that cadaverine (a compound with a similar chemical structure as putrescine; both are diamines) activates a similar pathway and produces similar escape and avoidance responses</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, in virgin rats whose first sexual experience was with a female rat whose vagina had cadaverine put on it, they had no aversion to putrescine for the rest of their life:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>James Pfaus’s team carried out similar experiments but this time with female rats with a hint of cadaverine, a  substance  produced  by  rotting  flesh  that  unequivocally  drives  away  every  rat in the world. Cadaverine is a very strong sign of the risk of infection: any rat who smells it, immediately flees. If you put an adult male into a cage with females  in  heat,  some  with  cadaverine  and  some  without,  he  won’t  even  go  near the ones that smell bad. Yet, a male whose first sexual experiences were with rats that smelled of cadaverine, shows no preference when exposed as an adult to females with cadaverine and without. And when one end of his cage is sprinkled with the putrid substance, unlike the other control male who runs off in fear, the conditioned male will go into the area with no problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are many examples of learned smells, most people have them in their own life from foods with unpleasant smells that they enjoy eating. If you eat something enough times, eventually your brain can be wired to enjoy that smell, which is why people eat things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surstr%C3%B6mming" target="_blank">surströmming</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durian" target="_blank">durian fruit</a>.</p>
<p>The inverse can also be true. A pleasing or neutral smell can be perceived as unpleasant if it becomes associated with unpleasant experiences. For some, the smells of various cleaning products might do this, e.g. the scent of an air freshener which is meant to be nice might be associated with toilets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
