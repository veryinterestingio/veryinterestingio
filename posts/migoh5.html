		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's a question you can't really give a general answer to, since there are different types of diarrhea that have different causes. I'll try to explain the most common ones to the best of my knowledge.</p>
<p>At first you have to know how the digestive system works. You eat something and it passes your esophagus and goes into your stomach. Your stomach is really good in splitting up proteins, but fats and carbohydrates are mostly split in your small intestine in which your halfway digested food mixture goes after its been in the stomach. For this pancreatic enzymes and gall are needed. Gall is produced in your liver and stored in your gallbladder, from where it is released into your small intestine when it's needed. The pancreatic enzymes split fats and carbohydrates and the gall emulates the fats so they can be split by the pancreatic enzymes.</p>
<p>This mixture goes through your small intestine where it's chemically digested further, but the nutrients and liquids your body needs are mostly absorbed in your colon. The entire mixture is really liquid until it gets to your colon where all the things your body needs are absorbed into your body. They need to be chemically digested before this happens, because otherwise the molecules are too big to absorbed to put it simple. Your bowel moves a lot to let the food mixture pass so it can reach your rectum and be pooped out in the end after all the good things are absorbed.</p>
<p>Now to the diarrhea. As you can see there are a lot of steps in food digestion and this was a very short and simplified explanation of what happens. Depending on where the problem lies the reasons for diarrhea are different.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Diarrhea can be caused by certain substances that attract water, for example medications or lactose. When a person is lactose intolerant, the body cannot produce the enzyme needed to split up lactose so the lactose stays intact during the entire digestive process. Lactose attracts water and because of this the water cannot be absorbed properly in your bowels if you are lactose intolerant and ate something containing it. Due to the high amount of liquid in your stool you get diarrhea until you pooped out all the lactose. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certain medical conditions or stress can cause your bowels to move way more than they usually would. Because they move so much the food mixture stays there for a short amount of time and the liquids and nutrients cannot be absorbed properly. Again, higher amount of liquid leads to diarrhea. Depending on the cause of the increased bowel movements it will just stop or you need medications to control it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If someone has issues with their pancreas, liver or gallbladder a lot of digestive enzymes cannot be produced in a big enough amount or work properly. These mostly affect the digestion of fats so you get really fatty stools that can, but don't have to be, diarrhea. You can actually see the fat in the poop in this cases. That's why people who have liver disease or had their gallbladder removed shouldn't eat very fatty foods.</p>
</li>
<li>If you have food poisoning, infections, chronic inflammatory bowel disease or took laxatives your bowels can actually secrete water (or phlegm and blood) instead of absorbing it. This stops when the cause is successfully treated. Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases cannot be cured, but there are treatments available that can increase the quality of life of the people suffering from them.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a lot more mechanisms involved and I am not a physician, I only went to nursing school. I feel like this should be enough information to give you a general understanding.</p>
<p>I'm sorry if there are any formatting issues, I'm currently on mobile. If anything sounds weird English is not my first language and I had to look up some of the specific terminology, feel free to correct me if I made any mistakes.</p>
<p>Edit: As u/Corlatesla commented nutrients are mostly absorbed in the small intestine and water and minerals are absorbed in the colon. I mixed this up while writing the comment</p>
<p>Edit: it seems that gall is not the correct word for the secrete stored in your gallbladder, the correct term is bile. I didn't know that word, so I'm sorry if it caused any confusion</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>u/redwineandpizza already answered the most of the cause of the changes in the stool underlying diarrhea (something drawing water into the bowel, excess fat, increased motility, etc.) but I can throw in a little information about what leads to the part you experience (urgency, mondo dumps).</p>
<p>The sensation of needing to void is tied to the rate of filling of the rectum. If it fills fast, as is the case when stuff is flying through your GI tract real fast due to the previously mentioned causes, you feel that &quot;oh shit&quot; sensation where you need to get to the bathroom ASAP because that turtle is coming out of it's shell whether you want it to or not. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>On the flipside, this is also why in many cases constipated people don't necessarily feel like they need to poop constantly. This is especially the case in people on opioid pain killers, where the rectum fills so slow they almost never get the urge to void, and they just wind up with a massive log backed up. That eventually does need to come out though, and it is very unpleasant when it does. So pro-tip, don't shoot up heroin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
