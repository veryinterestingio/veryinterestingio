		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If ancient humans saw dangerous insects crawling within their living area, it suddenly becomes incredibly advantageous (evolutionarily speaking) for the human to become hyper aware of their skin (causing phantom tingles etc) , resulting in them checking for their body for dangerous insects and mites, mosquitos ect. Think of it as a hangover from ancient humans that once helped save some cavemen lives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s an anticipatory reflex. Similar to our mouths watering when we smell food, or when we begin to shiver the minute you go outside when it’s cold (even before your core body temp can drop forcing you to start shivering.) </p>
<p>Our body has figured out certain reflexes that occur with the presence of a stimulus (in this case visualizing a bug) to allow a quicker favorable response to that situation</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not an explanation but when I was in HS, I took a psych class and one morning we walked in and the teacher handed out a flyer about swarms of insects in our area and had us all read it. After a few minutes the teacher asked one student to standup and tell the class what he’d just learned. The student stood up and said every person in class was scratching profusely while reading the paper(prior to handing out the papers he asked the first student who arrived not to read but to observe). The teacher went on to say that our minds associated scratching with mosquitoes and other bugs that have caused us to itch in the past, so while they might not physically be there our minds have linked the behaviour to what’s caused it in the past</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
