		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The coolest example of viral symbiosis in my opinion is seen in some parasitoid wasps.  Lots of wasps have venomous compounds that they use to paralyze or otherwise incapacitate prey, but a few actually use viruses instead.  Certain ichneumonid and braconid wasps have entire, intact viral DNA within their genomes, which they can use to produce viruses whenever they want.  The wasps <a href="https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fnrmicro2491/MediaObjects/41579_2011_Article_BFnrmicro2491_Fig1_HTML.jpg?as=webp" target="_blank">inject these viruses into their hosts</a> (usually caterpillars) along with their eggs, where the viruses will weaken the immune system.  Then, in classic parasitoid wasp fashion, the larvae eat their host from the inside until it eventually dies.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this form of viral symbiosis actually evolved independently in the two groups of wasps mentioned above, with ichnoviruses and bracoviruses pretty clearly showing distinct origins (<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000923" target="_blank">Volkoff et al. 2010</a>).  It's not uncommon for viruses to integrate their DNA with their host's; this has been documented in many animals (see, for example, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-019-0189-2" target="_blank">Johnson 2019</a>).  Our own genomes are composed of something like 5% endogenous retroviruses, but these are mostly inactivated remnants, and certainly don't show the same symbiotic relationship in our case.</p>
<p>If you want some more examples, check out <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro2491" target="_blank">Roossinck 2011</a>, which describes several other instances of known viral mutualisms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Retroviruses, like HIV, synthesize DNA fragments from their RNA once inside the cell. These DNA fragments can become incorporated into the hosts genome and, if it’s a germ line cell, passed on to offspring. The human genome contains about 5-8% retroviral like genes, some of which have been shown to be involved in normal human function (because mutations to these genes are seen in disease). These have been theorized to be a source of accelerated evolution in complex life, by making “gene swapping” possible naturally. Not only that, there are genes that encode for viral-like capsids in which human RNA is packaged and transferred between cells (look for Arc capsids in neural tissue). These packages look indistinguishable from viral capsids and seem to function the same way, just without causing disease. These findings really blur the line that actually defines a virus as a virus. To give one answer to your question, I would say we as humans have at least several symbiotic viruses which have been incorporated into our genome. Are these still viruses, however? That’s a harder question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes! <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> (baker's yeast) has a virus (technically, it's a satellite but w/e) that encodes a toxin that kills other yeast cells that don't have the virus. So in this example the virus increases the host's ability to compete with its neighbours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>ERV-3 makes pregnancy possible. An entire viral genome, seperated by introns in the DNA of all mammals activates and suppresses the immune system at critical stages during pregnancy. It results in the fetus not being rejected as foreign tissue. It is after all 50% DNA that is not of the organism maturing it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of great examples here. Another interesting example of a viral mutualistic symbiosis is a three way symbiosis between <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17255511/" target="_blank">Panic grass (<em>Dichanthelium lanuginosum</em>), the fungal endophyte <em>Curvularia protuberata</em>, and Curvularia thermotolerance virus.</a> Basically, the panic grass can only survive in the hot soils of Yellowstone with the help of the fungus, but the fungus can only survive those conditions with the help of the virus. If you want to read more about viral mutualistic symbioses, <a href="https://jvi.asm.org/content/89/13/6532" target="_blank">this</a> is a great paper. The top commenter posted Roossinck’s 2011 review, but there are some more examples in her 2015 paper I’ve linked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
