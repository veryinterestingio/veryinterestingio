		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Owning stock and having the stock increase in value causes the net worth to increase dramatically. Keep in mind, it’s not real money necessarily until it’s sold. If the markets crashed, their net worth would also drop dramatically.</p>
<p>If you look at Elon Musk, nearly all his investment is in Tesla. Tesla stock price doubled in the last few months alone. So not even counting income, his net worth skyrocketed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wealthy people don’t keep money in checking accounts or Scrooge McDuck vaults of gold - they keep all their money in investment assets.</p>
<p>A combination of very low interest rates and negligible returns on most other types of investments has pushed the stock market to double in the last five years.</p>
<p>If you had a billion dollars in the market in 2015, it’s now worth two billion.</p>
<p>If you had zero dollars in the market, you made nothing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Elon Musk owns \~20% of Tesla. He owned \~20% of Tesla last year when the company was worth \~$58 billion dollars, and he owns \~20% now when it's worth $842 billion dollars.</p>
<p>So his net worth increased by $156 billion dollars, but he doesn't exactly have more of anything. He had 20% of Tesla and he still has 20% of Tesla.</p>
<p>(This ignores SpaceX, the numbers are approximate, Tesla has diluted shares by issuing more, specifics are always more complicated, etc, etc, but this is the gist)</p>
<p>Someone like Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos are the easiest because their assets are really a portion of the companies they founded. What makes those companies become worth more is that investors (individuals, big finance cos, pension funds, etc) think the company will be worth more in the future so they buy shares.</p>
<p>That's the easiest way to think about it. They own assets and those assets become worth more.</p>
<p>edit: the $58B valuation was two years ago, not last year</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most &quot;rich people&quot; aren't rich in the sense that they have a pile of cash in the basement, or a lot of money on their bank account. They're usually &quot;rich&quot; by owning shares of their companies. If the stock price of that company goes up, they get richer by that percentage.</p>
<p>It is also the reason why they can't just spend X% of their net worth on <cause Y>. It's not liquid assets, they would have to sell stock of likely their own company, which in turn negatively impacts the stock price (since the CEO selling his own stock doesn't paint a good picture).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The vast majority of their wealth is in shares of stock in companies they founded or inherited. When shares of those companies go up, so does the net worth of those holding vast sums of shares in the companies. Companies like Amazon, Wal-Mart did well during the pandemic, as people shopped from home more, focused spending on necessities. Other cases were simply companies that continue to perform well despite the pandemic, like Tesla.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
