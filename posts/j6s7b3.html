		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pressure changes, either from your eye muscles tightening or from blood flow, can cause the light-sensitive cells inside your eyes to misfire. This creates false images and colors in your vision.</p>
<p>This is why you see &quot;stars&quot; if you stand up quickly after lying down or sitting for a period of time (head rush). The rapid blood pressure change causes misfires in your vision until the pressure goes back to normal. A similar thing happens if you get hit in the head. The physical force causes misfires in your vision and you see &quot;stars.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

He experiments with it to the point where he left himself blind for a few weeks after stabbing a needle in the whites of his eye.</p>
<p>His work in alchemy was equally useless. But his intense curiosity is what made him such a great thinker.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s a phenomenon called <a href="https://scienceline.org/2014/12/why-do-we-see-colors-with-our-eyes-closed/" target="_blank">phosphenes</a></p>
<p>The link above suggests that the phenomenon may be caused by the light-receptive cells in your eyes actually seeing photons that are released from the cells in your eye itself.</p>
<p>The reasoning for this is that some biological processes have been found to generate very weak bioluminescence (light). This makes sense when you know a bit of chemistry: in order for an electron to move from a lower to higher shell (orbit) of an atom, it needs to absorb energy in the form of a photon, to go to a lower shell it releases a photon of exactly the same wavelength that made it go up. Photons are otherwise known as electromagnetic radiation, and when their wavelengths fall with the range we can see we call them light. </p>
<p>Given that this phenomenon involves some of the most complex biological mechanisms there are, it needs more research to know exactly what’s going on, but the point is you may actually be seeing real light and not just “misfiring” of cells caused by pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
