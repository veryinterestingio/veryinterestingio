		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We're industrial/organizational psychologists whose recent study on emotional labor and drinking gained <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/bbe8ir/employees_who_force_themselves_to_smile_and_be/" target="_blank">some traction on /r/science</a>. We're here to answer your questions about controlling emotions at work, its effects on health and productivity, or what the heck an industrial/organizational psychologist is, anyway.</p>
<p>First, some basics. Industrial/Organizational psychology is the scientific study of people at work. Topics range from how to fairly select and place the best applicants, evaluate training programs, and measure job performance; to how to lead effectively, work in teams, motivate employees, and improve their health. It also just so happens to be one of the best jobs in science, according to <a href="https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/rankings/best-science-jobs" target="_blank">U.S. News and World Report</a> (not that we're bragging or anything...).</p>
<p>Our line of research, which focuses on emotional labor, ties in aspects of employee motivation, performance, and health. Similar to how we think of jobs requiring physical or mental labor, emotional labor refers to controlling your emotions to be in line with how your job expects you to feel - like how restaurant servers, nurses, cashiers, teachers, bartenders are expected to be kind, friendly, or service-oriented. We typically talk about emotional labor being done through two strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Surface acting</strong> - faking or suppressing your emotional display to others
<ul>
<li>Faking a smile, holding back frustration towards a customer</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Deep acting</strong> - bringing your true feelings in line with what the job requires
<ul>
<li>Thinking happy thoughts before a shift</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>There's been a ton of work looking at the effects of emotional labor since Arlie Hochschild
coined the concept in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=X7rSS1RMvVAC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">1983</a> - here's a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kCMyBcVTNxGT3x9PGeu8eZkbihujSqdR" target="_blank">basic summary</a>, as well as a more <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1d7uUUV2WHMZt6dFwFlsFJ3ihW1j-Yb9O" target="_blank">in-depth review</a>.</p>
<p>In a national sample of U.S. workers, <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1O2HB_ecOLQqsQ4PjJDXECQrC3ubRcFuQ" target="_blank">our study</a> finds that <em>individuals who surface acted more tended to engage in more heavy drinking</em>. This relationship holds even after accounting for demographics (gender, age, education, income), employees' tendency to be in a bad mood, and the emotional demands of the job. We also found that employees who are more impulsive, have less control over their work, or have more short-term interactions (think cashier, compared to nurse or teacher) are especially at risk. We'll be on from 2-4 (ET, 18-20 UT) and we'd love to answer any questions you might have about our study, emotional labor more generally, or the study of people at work!</p>

<p>So now instead of your methodology, I want to ask why you're linking your work behind a paywall?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a question about the “Deep Acting” method you mention. As a recovering alcoholic and member of AA, I am already familiar with (and advocate for) a lifestyle where one re-aligns ones spirit around acceptance of life on life’s terms and I set my goals as reasonably as possible. Aligning my personal goals and feelings to cater to the requirements of my job sounds like a natural and healthy way to find contentment at work. </p>
<p>But yet I struggle sometimes with this because some employers, and I’ve had many as a mostly IT contract worker, do not make the same investment in their employees. I spend a lot of mental energy psyching myself up for my day and aligning my goals with the goals of the company only to have things like benefits stripped away, income levels decrease, retirement opportunities evaporate, and overall office morale slowly erode over time. </p>
<p>I’m left with the question of how using either of these acting methods you outlined actually benefit anyone other then the employer themselves? I mean sure, I understand about putting on a professional persona for customers - but doesn’t my relationship with my employer deserve a more direct and sometimes, yes, emotional dialogue to get them to understand that it’s not ok to treat their employees as less important than their profits? </p>
<p>I know there are good and bad companies, but being a contract employee has allowed me to move around a lot and spot trends. And most of those trends seem to be pretty negative for those employees that are below the middle management layer. </p>
<p>In the 90’s, as the IT boom was taking off, it seems that companies sought out individuals with unique personalities and skills. The more quirks you had, it seemed, the better - as long as you also brought talent to the table. Diversity was a huge thing. </p>
<p>But when I see your summary of what you study, and these acting methods, I don’t see tools for employees to increase their happiness. I see coping tools for employees to forget they are often being taken advantage of. And no matter how much I change my feelings and behavior to suit my employers needs, at the end of the day I’m expendable and all the acting in the world doesn’t improve my situation. </p>
<p>So I guess my question is: how are any of these methods of modifying my behavior as an employee actually improving my employers ability to understand my needs and change THEIR behavior and make THEM a good company to work for? Wouldn’t direct communication backed by the emotion of human compassion and building a diverse culture of unique individuals still be the more effective way to build a company culture?</p>
<p>Maybe I just don’t understand what you’re trying to accomplish?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe slightly off topic, but does all this smiling work?</p>
<p>We do not do this in Europe. And it feels weird [to me when I visit America] when employees behave like this. Do you get used to this and then like it and visit more often? Also carefully media trained American politicians tend to smile after every second sentence. I find that creepy; is that just me?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like others have posted, the study is behind a paywall, so I'm mainly going off the public abstract and the AAAS article.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Most papers in physics and mathematics (and, I believe, CS) are posted as preprints on the ArXiV, and in particle physics, for example, the majority of new final journal articles are also publicly accessible. Considering that in many cases psychology papers are more closely related to questions that are of interest to policy-makers (especially in the government) or to the general public, why, in your opinion, is this practice not common in psychology? Is it more due to institutional inertia or due to pushback from publishers, or something else?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your results are phrased as follows in your post (and similarly in the article linked): &quot;individuals who surface acted more tended to engage in more heavy drinking.&quot; But it's not clear to me how one can derive a causality chain just by looking at phone interviews -- for instance, someone could claim that people who were more likely to indulge in heavy drinking also tended to be the people who sought out customer-facing jobs, since I imagine both are traits associated with extroversion. Would it not make more sense to phrase it as a correlation? The reason this distinction is important is because a causal claim might lead people to interpret the results as suggesting that the problem of heavy drinking among employees might be mitigated just by not asking their employees to smile more, while the data only suggests a correlation.</p>
</li>
<li>The sample size, N = 1600, seems rather small. It's not clear how this dataset was divided -- it seems there were multiple categories including people who didn't have a customer-facing job, and people who faced customers at varying levels. So at most you might have had a few hundred people per dataset; meaning that from statistics alone, you'd expect an dispersion of roughly a few tens of people per dataset. Since a p-value is not stated in the abstract, it's difficult to judge the degree of certainty in the results.</li>
