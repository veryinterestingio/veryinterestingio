		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Quitting smoking before the age of 40 reduces the risk of dying from smoking-related disease by about 90%.&quot;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>More:</p>
<p>20 minutes after quitting</p>
<p>Your heart rate and blood pressure drop.</p>
<h2>12 hours after quitting</h2>
<p>The carbon monoxide level in your blood drops to normal.</p>
<h2>2 weeks to 3 months after quitting</h2>
<p>Your circulation improves and your lung function increases.</p>
<h2>1 to 9 months after quittingCoughing and shortness of breath decrease. Tiny hair-like structures that move mucus out of the lungs (called cilia) start to regain normal function in your lungs, increasing their ability to handle mucus, clean the lungs, and reduce the risk of infection.</h2>
<h2>1 year after quitting</h2>
<p>The excess risk of coronary heart disease is half that of someone who still smokes. Your heart attack risk drops dramatically.</p>
<h2>5 years after quitting</h2>
<p>Your risk of cancers of the mouth, throat, esophagus, and bladder is cut in half. Cervical cancer risk falls to that of a non-smoker. Your stroke risk can fall to that of a non-smoker after 2 to 5 years.</p>
<h2>10 years after quitting</h2>
<p>Your risk of dying from lung cancer is about half that of a person who is still smoking. Your risk of cancer of the larynx (voice box) and pancreas decreases.</p>
<h2>15 years after quitting</h2>
<p>Your risk of coronary heart disease is that of a non-smokerâ€™s.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The US National Cancer Institute has published long-term data showing the risk of lung cancer in ex-smokers comes down to baseline in 15-20 years. So it takes that long for ex-smokers to have the same lung cancer risk as never-smoker.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Smoking produces inflammation in the lungs. Inflammation activates enzymes (MMP) to destroy the walls of the alveoli. Alveoli are tiny air-filled sacs. When the walls are destroyed, many alveoli fuse together into a single large alveolus. This is called emphysema, and it's part of the disease COPD.</p>
<p>COPD belongs to the group of obstructive lung diseases. The primary problem is exhalation, not inhalation. Forced expiratory volume (FEV) is reduced, meaning you can exhale less air. This is measured in a test called spirometry.</p>
<p>In theory, lung tissue can be repaired. The alveoli contain <a href="https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/nnl/respiratory/lung/regen/index.htm" target="_blank">stem cells</a> which can regrow the damaged walls. In practice, emphysema is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2699955/" target="_blank">irreversible</a>. The alveoli do not grow back. It is believed that cigarette smoke prevents repair.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Serious question: what about cigar smoke or tobacco- and nicotine- free herbal cigarettes? While I realize that cigar smoke has carcinogens like cigarettes, is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/a1az4x/comment/eaolmkp?st=JP23HXZ8&amp;sh=6e9e826e" target="_blank">irritation and/or inflammation</a> from inhalation of any kind of combustible material the cause of diseases found in smokers?</p>
<p>Also, in regards to emphysema: one of my neighbors has had it for decades and continues to smoke. How is she not dead from this? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, smoking related lung disease does not heal. After reaching adulthood, we all lose lung function at a steady rate. For those who have smoking related lung disease, they lose lung function more rapidly. If they quit, they lung function generally goes back to declining at the original rate, but doesn't recover.</p>
<p>Mucosal cilia will grow back, but the amount if air you can effectively move with each breath does not.
For those who have emphysematous lung disease rather than COPD, the same thing applies.</p>
<p>In short, what lung function is lost will not be regained, but quitting smoking may still have benefit in that the rate of lung function decline goes back to normal in most people.</p>
<p>The problem is most people don't quit until several decades of damage is done.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
