<p>If not, is this because oxygen kill them, lack of oxygen is conducive to a certain chemical reaction, oxygen rich environments allow other types of bacteria to thrive and deprive them of resources, or  what?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, they generally cannot survive long in oxygen-rich environments because they lack the enzymes necessary to degrade toxic oxygen byproducts. Oxygen is highly toxic and forms reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide anion (O2•−), and hydroxyl radicals (OH•), all of which damage DNA. Microbes that are strict anaerobes lack some of the enzymes that break down these toxic byproducts, and so they don't survive long in oxygen-rich environments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey I work in the lab, Clostridium botulinum are spore forming large gram positive bacilli that belong to the strict anaerobe bacteria. They lack an enzyme that gets rid of the toxic oxygen byproducts, which means they can't survive in oxygen. But their spores are very resistant to environmental effects and can survive for many years until they are in oxygen poor conditions such as poorly canned/stored foods. That's why you may sometimes hear about recalls of canned foods. The toxin they produce is <strong>among the deadliest of bacterial toxins known</strong>, which attacks nervous system and muscles of respiration causing paralysis and cardiac arrest. The toxins are destroyed by heat so its important to boil food properly before eating. The interesting thing is when someone gets a botox, they are literally destroying their nerves responsible for muscle movement.</p>
<p>There is also a thing called infant botulism where the spores are ingested with honey causing bacteria to colonize and reproduce in the gut of the infant. This is why babies must not be fed honey.</p>
<p>There are also other clinically significant species of this bacteria such as Clostridium tetani, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium difficile. All are very bad and I'd recommend looking them up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also your common household yeast (Saccharomyces Sereviseae, single cell fungi) can live without oxygen (anaerobic), but grows better with oxygen, so they are facultative anaerobes. They change their metabolism if they don't have oxygen. They will not produce alcohol, if there is oxygen present.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two kinds of life: <em>aerobic</em>, adapted to using and defending off oxygen, and <em>anaerobic</em>, life not adjusted to oxygen's reactivity.</p>
<p>Why do things need to defend themselves from oxygen? And why does anaerobic life exist if oxygen is &quot;<em>everewhere</em>&quot;?</p>
<p>Well, anaerobic life evolved first, before photosynthetic life, and therefore, before atmospheric oxygen. So they exist because they're very very old and the remnants of the original basis for all life. This also means their all single celled bacterium and archaea.</p>
<p>So why do cells and living things need protection form oxygen? Well, it's VERY reactive, especially when compared with the relatively innert anaerobic favorites like methane, CO2, SO2, etc. Atomic oxygen(O, not O2 <em>Atmospheric oxygen</em>) needs an electron, and it <em>needs it bad</em>. So &quot;free radicals&quot;, singluar unpaired oxygen atoms, can ionize pretty much anything for that electron; pretty much anything including things like your cell walls, and DNA... Not great for multi-cellular life, death for a single cell.  Most life, have adapted to combat these, and even use oxygen's reactivity to get up to <em>19 times</em> more ATP per glucose with aerobic metabolisms!    As a side; this is what anti-oxidants are, foods containing compounds good at absorbing free radicals, instead of say your cells or dna.</p>
<p>So all multi-cellular life is aerobic, as are <em>most</em> bacteria, but some still remain anaerobic in oxygen free environments.</p>
<p>Clostridium Botulinum is anaerobic, so basically oxygen kills it like <em>severe exposure to high-energy radiation</em> would you.</p>
<p>Their a fairly simple type of bacteria, bacillus, simple tubes/worms. The botulinum toxins are produced as a byproduct of their anaerobic metabolism, which is quite different from what using oxygen entails, as mentioned in their chemical foods earlier. Most of what they breathe and eat we find mildly toxic or expel as waste products, so when theyre combining those into their own waste, it (usually) just becomes even more toxic to us.   You don't want that happening in unpasteurized cans, because their massive on a bacterial scale, and free of oxygen to prevent aerobic bacteria growth.</p>
<p>Tl;dr
Botulinum is anaerobic, oxygen kills it. It being anaerobic is why it produces those specific toxins/byproducts.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Botulinum is a member of the Clostridium genus like it's famously difficult to eradicate in a hospital cousin C. Difficile. Also like C.Diff, C. Botulinum can form into an endospore which protects it from unsuitable and even toxic environments. These spores can and do exist practically everywhere in high oxygen environments and can be ingested without poisoning you. Once you can or jar fruit or vegetables without sufficiently boiling them and their container, the botulinum activates in the cool dark anoxic environment and starts to produce neuro-toxin as a waste product. This can also happen at the bottom of lakes, rivers, and oceans as mats of dense un-decomposed organic matter collect on the lake bed. It's that neuro-toxin, not the C. botulinum itself that kills you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
