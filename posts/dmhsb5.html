The material properties at the relevant temperatures to allow this process must be considered, not just reflectivity.</p>
<p>EDIT: Adding another point given by /u/evensevenone for visibility, since gold doesn't reflect bluer wavelengths well (it looks golden, after all) but does reflect infrared, that means that it will absorb energy without being able to emit it away again very efficiently, so it would get pretty hot in space, which is not a great property to have in a heat shield. Aluminum has a flatter reflectivity spectrum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The heat shield is primarily to reflect electromagnetic radiation from the sun. Most of this radiation is in the visible band with the peak at around 500nm. At 500nm and shorter wavelengths, gold is only about 40% reflective. It is very reflective above 600nm or so. This is actually what gives it the gold hue, it is absorbing green, blue, and violet and reflecting yellow orange and red. Anyway, that absorption makes it a poor choice to reflect solar energy.</p>
<p>The heat shield is made out of kapton and use an aluminum coating for reflectivity. Aluminum is very reflective across the whole visible band (good for reflecting the sun). It's not quite a good at IR as gold, so the mirror for the telescope uses gold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming you're asking why the optical coating on the MLI is aluminized Kapton rather than goldized Kapton. See page 11 of this NASA report:</p>
<p><a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19990047691.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19990047691.pdf" target="_blank">https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19990047691.pdf</a></a></p>
<p>Basically goldized film has lower emissivity than aluminized film but higher absorptance- I'm guessing they care more about low absorptance for the heat sheild, whereas goldized MLI  would be better suited to an application intended to reduce radiative losses (i.e. keeping heat in.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Slight correction: the mirrors are actually made out of beryllium and surface-coated with gold. Beryllium is much more lightweight and much more robust in extreme environments like the vacuum of space. It's less susceptible to the extreme temperature fluctuations and the constant exposure to radiation.</p>
<p>Edit: here's a NASA article on the manufacturing process for the mirrors in case anyone is interested</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The research group I worked for in college studied insulating materials that NASA was considering for use on the JWST. We were paid by NASA and ESA. In fact, I got to study some mock ups of the primary mirror from Ball Aerospace. Some of our results influenced a few redesigns.</p>
<p>For one, gold world be incredibly heavy making the cost to fly it incredibly higher than it already is. Also, as has been said, it's properties would make it difficult to fold and unfold especially in those temperatures. Lastly, because gold is an excellent reflector, it's also an excellent conductor. The gold might transfer some of the heat from the sun to the detectors of the satellite and thus introduce noise to their data.</p>
<p>One of the materials we studied at my college was an insulator being used for the heat shield. Our studies were to create average solar storm conditions under vacuum using an election gun. We found that the insulator started emitting secondary photons in the infrared wavelengths that NASA/ESA were trying to observe. That would make no use to NASA if their satellite was glowing in the same wavelength that they were trying to observe. Good times. I got to meet Mike Mendzel, the senior engineer for JWST because of that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
