		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your skin contains different types of nerves (neurones) that are able to detect different things. Some of these sensory neurones detect heat, others detect low temperatures, while others detect pain, or touch, to name a few. All of these neurones work in the same basic way - once they have detected something, they send an electrical signal to the spinal cord which is then passed onto a second neurone which travels up to the brain. Once there, it activates certain parts of the brain associated with a certain feeling (hot, cold, pain, etc.). </p>
<p>However not all signals are equal. The pain signals are split into two main types; dull, aching pain (carried by C neurones) and sharp, acute pain (carried by A-Delta neurones). What's interesting is that C neurones also sense heat of warmth. The theory is that by providing a heat at a comfortable temperature, you activate the C neurones so they sense that you are warm. This essentially blocks the pain signal from being sent to the spinal cord, so it is never registered as pain in your brain. Instead, you trick your brain into thinking you’re just a bit warm (which isn’t painful). </p>
<p>This is why heat is better for dull and achy pain than for sharp pain like when you just whack your head. There are ways around this too though, for example if you have ever rubbed an area of skin that you’ve just hurt and it feels better. This is because the signals coming from the neurones which detect touch are all activated, and get to the spinal cord, which helps to block out the painful signals. Think of it like two roads called A and B, both leading to the same town (the brain) but which have to merge first (at the spinal cord). If there are more cars on road A to begin with,  then more of them are going to eventually make it to town.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When a muscle is cramping, it means the muscle is contracting involuntarily. When this is happening, the application of heat can help relax the muscle (this also helps with tight or knotted muscles anywhere on the body) in part by increasing blood flow.</p>
<p>In the same way, heat helps relax the muscles of the uterus that are cramping.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
