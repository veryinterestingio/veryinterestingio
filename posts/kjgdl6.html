		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Chemical burn&quot; is a term that refers to the effect, rather than the process.  It's used to indicate the damage that was done to the skin or the organ, and the source of it.  </p>
<p>In terms of damage, cells are damaged or ruptured over a large area of skin, and &quot;first degree, second, or third&quot; indicates how deeply into the various layers of the skin the damage is, basically the extent of the damage.</p>
<p>It's more of a layman's medical term; the doctors are concerned about the damage that was done, rather than the differences between heat, cold, and acids or bases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Referring to these as “burns” is mostly a matter of convenience. In the hospital injuries to the skin from heat or cold are referred to as “thermal injuries”.  There’s also electrical injuries and chemical and so on. However it’s the same group of people in the hospital that deal with all these types of injuries and it’s usually the burn unit or plastic surgery teams. Because of this people often just call everything a burn of one type or another. In reality it’s more about the fact that it’s all injuries to the skin.
When you work on those units there’s technical terms that are used to be clear about what type of injury and how bad. So they might say it’s a superficial partial thickness scald to 4% total body surface area.  But in layman’s terms they mean the person was has a second degree burn from hot water to part of their arm and hand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To my understanding, you have the concept backwards. Burns are not tied to fire, but fire is tied to burns. Burns are when a forced chemical change takes place. For fire, it's when combustion occurs and the material changes as the fuel is consumed. For chemicals, it's some other process, but fundamentally changed the molecules it interacted with in some way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
