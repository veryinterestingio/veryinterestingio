		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off, ice floats on water so as soon as it begins forming, you have have well-defined interfaces between the air, ice, and water. As the layer of ice gets thicker, the resistance to flow of heat through the ice increases and less and less heat is able to leave the liquid water, through the ice, and into the air (for a given temperature difference between the air and water). At some point, the ice is thick enough to act as an insulative layer between the liquid water and the cold air above the ice. If the water is deep enough, eventually the heat that is able to leave the water through the ice to the low temperature air is balanced by the heat entering the water from the earth around it. Everything is in equilibrium, and the ice layer quits growing before the entire body of water can freeze solid.</p>
<p>If ice didn't float, the water would freeze solid. The ice would fall to the bottom, continuously leaving the surface of the water exposed to cold air to make more ice. As the ice collected at the bottom, instead of insulating the water from the cold air, it would insulate the water from the warm earth. The rate of freezing would be expected to accelerate over time as incoming heat from the earth slowed while heat loss to the atmosphere remained relatively constant instead of the other way around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It happens for the same reason that ice floats on water.</p>
<p>With most substances density goes down as temperature increases. Liquid water is densest at 3 centigrade. So the bottom of a frozen pond will contain water about 2-3 degrees.</p>
<p>Warmer water goes down and stays liquid, colder water goes up and freezes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In lakes, it's just because ice floats. The liquid water underneath is NOT below its freezing point.</p>
<p>Water is weird in that it's less dense as a solid than a liquid. So as ice forms it floats up and forms a layer across the top. Water is most dense at \~ +3-4 degrees C, so the very bottom of the lake is +3, above freezing. If the weather stays cold, more freezes at the surface and the ice layer gets thicker, but because of the density thing lakes freeze from the top down.</p>
<p>The top-down freezing is pretty slow, because the existing ice layer is a pretty good insulator, keeping the above-freezing water beneath from losing much more heat to the air above. And the thicker the ice layer gets, the slower the heat loss and the slower the additional freezing. But there's no supercooling or anything. The water underneath is above freezing and hasn't gotten cold enough to freeze yet. It's like an icecube tray after only 1 hr in the freezer.</p>
<p>The Antarctica situation is more complicated because the pressure of being under a mile of ice changes the freezing point of water, and because in some cases it's heated by thermal energy from below. But there's no supercooled water there either. If there's liquid water underground in Antarctica, that's because it's above its freezing point (given local temp and pressure) there too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water, it turns out, is an amazing substance. Most compounds in the solid state or more dense than the liquid so they sink. If water did this, our world would remain frozen for most of the year as the layer of water on top would insulate the ice and it would keep building up from the poles out.  Ice is less dense than water and so it floats! That is why there is water beneath an ice sheet. This quality makes life possible on our planet. I learned this in Chem 101 and it never ceases to amaze me....there are also other chemistry reasons why water is so good at supporting complex life, but it starts with ice, the solid form of water, being less dense than its liquid form.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pure water freezes to ice at 0C and 1 atm of pressure.</p>
<p>Unlike most substances, the freezing point of water decreases with increased pressure. </p>
<p>As you go deeper in the ocean, the pressure increases, so it needs to be even colder to freeze it at that depth than near the surface </p>
<p>Also, the salinity of the ocean further lowers the freezing point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
