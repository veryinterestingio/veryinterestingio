Then you dream and all the stories you were obsessing about are flushed until you wake up and start fixating on your thoughts again. Try experience negative emotions when you're not paying attention to your thoughts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Research seems to suggest that sleep is like a reboot for the brain. Also you lose all sense of time and space in sleep. This is a very important function of the brain that it shuts down in sleep. It seems your brain resets connections literally in sleep, helping you get an actual fresh start</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way you feel is a mix of thoughts and ideas in your head, and chemicals and hormones in your body. Those things together are responsible for your overall brain state.</p>
<p>This means that either one of those things can change your mood, so your thoughts or mental state can be improved for example if you see a puppy or kitten, and it immediately makes you happy, that's your thoughts making you happy, which then floods your body with happy hormones as well. This can happen for various reasons.</p>
<p>Now thoughts can be pretty instant changes, and hormones and body chemistry can change really, really fast, but take a while to dissipate. Think about how much adrenaline pumps through your body when you get a small scare, or you hear a bang, or maybe a car you didn't quite see honks at you?</p>
<p>That happens almost instantly, but takes a little while for your heart rate to drop and your mood to return to normal. And this means that our moods might sometimes affect our behaviour and thoughts, and we might not act quite like we normally would. So while our body chemistry is in 'big mood mode', our thoughts can be influenced by that. This will become important later. </p>
<p>Think of it that it's easy to dump a load of marbles out of a bag when you need to, but cleaning them up takes longer. Evolution means it's better for us to change mood quickly, but we don't need to be able to get out of them instantly as we're smart so we can, to some extent, control the way we act as we go back to feeling normal!</p>
<p>So generally your brain sends a signal to your body, very quickly, and the body chemistry responds by doing whatever it needs to survive or deal with the information. That might mean making you feel happy at seeing a puppy, or put you in fight or flight mode, after which it dissipates.</p>
<p>Now, negative thoughts and emotions are often caused by thoughts, but they also have an effect on our body chemistry. So when you go to sleep, those thoughts stop and you're asleep, so the body stops producing the chemicals and hormones that those thoughts and moods trigger, and your body chemistry begins to go back to normal.</p>
<p>This means that when you wake up you still have the intellectual part of the thoughts, but the raised body chemistry isn't there, so you might feel much calmer, happier or more rested. Especially so if you were hungry, angry, tired or emotional. Going to bed can often remove the involuntary part of our response to a situation or mood, and leave only the thoughts. It lets you be calmer and clearer.</p>
<p>It's excactly why people say to sleep on a big decision.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
