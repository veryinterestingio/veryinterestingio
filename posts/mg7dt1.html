		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different kinds of mold are bad for us. Like bacteria, there’s many species; some are harmful, some are harmless or even nutritious. The ones used to make moldy cheeses are carefully selected cultures that don’t harm us. The ones on your old bread or fruit that get you sick generally will digest into chemicals that make you sick. So unless you’re able to determine the species, or it’s meant to be there, don’t eat the mold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Mold on bread can be a lot of different things, some good some bad. It's not carefully selected and it grows at its own pace.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Carefully growing and then sharing the safe and healthy molds and bacteria is based on a lot of trial and error.  Same for information.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Your stomachs acid will most likely take care of it. </p>
<p>It's not recommended to eat because you don't know what type of fungus it is. So there's a chance it might be really bad for you. So why would you risk it given the bad taste.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With mold, It's &quot;possible to be bad for you&quot;. I ate mold for a year of my life and never had any problems. Like literally, almost daily. I had no way to refrigerate food and had to keep it in the trunk of a car in a hot country. Stuff like bread lasted barely a day or two, even though I tried to choose most terrible chemical-filled one in hopes it'll last longer. Didn't. Got used to it, stopped caring about it.</p>
<p>Of course, there's 3-day mold on your bread, and 30-year mold in your basement, happily collecting dust and insect poop. Definitely wouldn't risk with latter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
