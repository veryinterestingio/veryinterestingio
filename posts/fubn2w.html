		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The newest CDC guidelines contain several reuse strategies, the easiest - if you still have supplies, that is - is to dispense 5 masks/respirators to staff. Have them number them and or the bags they go into, using one mask per day and then placing it into the paper bag (please be careful not to contaminate the inside of the mask). After the fifth day, you start over at mask #1. The research from UNMC suggests that after about 3 days they don't seal well and need to be tossed, but with the rotation that could get you several weeks of use.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is not ideal to reuse masks, but CDC has released guidelines essentially stating that masks should be stored in a &quot;clean, breathable container such as  paper bag.&quot; <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hcwcontrols/recommendedguidanceextuse.html" target="_blank">CDC guidelines</a></p>
<p>Indeed some articles are stating that COVID-19 can live up to 3 days on certain surfaces so that in theory <a href="https://www.insider.com/can-you-reuse-a-face-mask" target="_blank">leaving them to sit out in a well-ventilated area</a> is a possibility given the shortage.</p>
<p>Lastly, studies from <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2020/04/01/researchers-show-how-to-decontaminate-reuse-n95-masks/" target="_blank">Stanford researchers</a> and others show that treating <em>N95</em> masks at constant 158 F (70 C) for 30 minutes can also inactivate viruses (i.e., H1N1/H5N1) without damaging the functionality of the equipment. However, these are all not ideal or &quot;endorsed&quot; and must be rigorously followed to ensure effectiveness.</p>
<p>As it's been pointed out to me, the Stanford study does not include data on heat inactivation of coronaviruses explicitly (rather <em>E. Coli</em>), but could be used as by healthcare providers if absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Edits: Specified N95 masks from the Stanford study and changed language from &quot;baking&quot; to treating at constant temp for further clarification. Also thanks to u/bookerTmandela for clarifying information about the lack of research on heat inactivation of coronaviruses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in biomedical textiles and we're actually looking at this issue. The masks are non-woven fabrics just like how baby wipes and filters are made. When a person uses.a surgical mask they are breathing out humid air. The masks get pretty damp over a few hours. If you've had one on you know how muggy it gets.</p>
<p>So you've got this moist (I'm sorry) mask with microorganisms on both sides. If that moisture evaporates then most of the microorganisms won't survive past a few days. This isn't always possible in some non-woven fabrics especially those made by thermoplastic fibers. </p>
<p>The thermoplastic fibers are extruded and collected onto a belt while still hot, a process called meltblowing. The meltblown process causes really small pore sizes in the material. Spunbonded materials are similar though they have larger fibers and larger pores. The pores can make it difficult for moisture to evaporate. Most often they need high temperatures, radiation, or chemical sterilization. </p>
<p>The other issue is a lot of times the virus is &quot;detectable&quot; on surfaces for two weeks or more. This doesn't mean the virus is viable, even if it is there might not be enough of the virus to actually infect anyone. </p>
<p>Masks are also difficult since most fabrics are too thick to be effectively sterilized with UV, as UV only works on the exposed surface.</p>
<p>Edit to add: if anyone wants to learn about the FDA requirements for surgical masks here is the link for the pre market notification information. <a href="https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/surgical-masks-premarket-notification-510k-submissions#5" target="_blank">link</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bare in mind all this talk of baking and sterilization of masks - it does NOT sterilize the mask, it's just designed to kill covid, and does NOT meet normal infection control standards, not even close, and in normal circumstances would be considered totally inadequate. Those masks are not clean, not sterile - they should just not be covid infected. That's it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An important point to remember is that it is not only the coronavirus that can cause problems. Masks and other PPE protect against a host of other bacteria and nasty stuff (e.g. nosocomial infections), which is why they're used. So even if you've gotten rid of CV-19, reusing PPE (unless properly disinfected - see other comments) is really tricky. </p>
<p>e.g. Acinetobacter baumannii, a moisture-loving bug that is a common cause of opportunistic infections in hospitals, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, can easily be transferred from examination gloves to plastic surfaces....</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
