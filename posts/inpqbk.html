		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends a lot on the exact kind of amnesia. The most common form of amnesia in movies is the loss of autobiographical long-term memory. Autobiographical memory is the ability to remember past events that have happened to you in a kind of slide show fashion - remembering your 10th birthday for example is autobiographical memory. However, these memories are stored in a different way to memories that are about knowledge, so even if you lose your autobiographical memory, you'll still retain a lot of the important stuff. For example, you could forget how you learned to speak Chinese, but still be able to speak Chinese.</p>
<p>Memory forms a huge part of who we are as people, so personality would be very different after memory loss. But it's not the only thing that determines our personality. Even after losing your memories, you're still just as smart and cunning as you used to be, and you still know many of the same things you used to know, especially in the &quot;skills&quot; department. It's quite common for people with memory loss to still be very similar to the person they used to be in a lot of ways, and as they gain new memories it can be hard to tell how much they change as a result of that is change they would have been through anyway, had they not had memory loss. </p>
<p>The most interesting part I think is that it's quite common for feelings to remain after memory loss even if memories don't. For example, when my grandfather's Alzheimers progressed to the point he could no longer remember who my grandmother was, he'd still get happy when she came to see him, and would constantly propose to her.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
