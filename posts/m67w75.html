		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mattresses are a consumable item. Due to their size it’s also hard to fit numerous choices inside one store so that leads to competition. And it is best for competition to be right next to each other. When someone says they want to look at a mattress, they don’t have to drive far to get another choice. It makes that location a great place for others to all pool their resources. Just like food trucks that congregate in one area instead of spreading out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mattresses have the styrofoam issue. A pack of styrofoam cups costs like 1 cent to make. But if they sold for like 2 or 3 cents a pack, a 200% profit wouldn't be enough. It would be great margin, but low profits. The problem then is they take up space on a truck that could hold lower margin, but higher profit items. The cost to load and unload by itself isn't worth the margin.</p>
<p>Most mattresses can be made for literal pennies. The fabric covering the mattress is the most expensive part of it by far. So we have a similar issue to the styrofoam cups. Plus now you gotta pay guys to carry it around, and you need to pay trucks money to move mattresses around, etc. Next issue is the low volume. How often do you buy a mattress? Yea not very often.</p>
<p>So the only way to profit off selling a mattress is to jack the price up. That's how you end up with a mattress costing $1500 despite using $5 of materials, $5 of labor, and $5 of shipping. So every mattress sold is huge. You only need to sell 1 or 2 mattresses a day to make it worth it.</p>
<p>As for why you pass so many, it's all because of location. Usually a store will do a lot of research to pick a location. If you are a new store you can capitalize on that by just building next door with doing no research. AND you now benefit by people who are actively shopping for mattresses seeing your store right next door. Odds are near 100% they will walk into both stores before making a purchase. Essentially most stores are being cheap and trying to leech off the original store.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Further to all the excellent points raised about the nature of store space and high margins leading to too much competition for one store to represent alongside healthy coverage of overheads, they also may be a sort of subconscious aspect to this associated with the costs to consumers of actually shopping.</p>
<p>If you see four mattress stores next to each other, you may think there's an abundance of them. What you may in fact be seeing is all the mattress stores for a very large catchment area, that have al decided to opn up next to each other becuase they Wil get more foot traffic, as someone looking to buy a mattress could go to all four stores on the same trip, vs they may only go to one and buy the best item there to save them another trip to a different store further away. It might not drive up overall industry sales to do this, but it gives all players in the market the chance to be more equally considered for each sale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In recent years, a lot of startup companies have switched to 'online only' model, where they even give you a trial of the mattress for 30 days or so. The design and the vacuum packing allows them to ship directly to your home. </p>
<p>There's has been a disruption in this segment, lately. A lot of manufacturers, usually new entrants are trying this model. Customers are buying based on the Reviews and word of mouth, and it's growing at a huge rate. </p>
<p>So I think the brick and mortar will feel some heat and the prices will come down by a decent percentage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
