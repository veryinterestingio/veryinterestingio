		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there is! Since the rate of fusion inside massive stars grows <em>so</em> quickly with temperature (and therefore with the mass of the star), and since light carries momentum, you can reach a point at which the light created through fusion is pushing outward more strongly than gravity is pulling things in. This is called the <strong>Eddington limit</strong>, where radiation pressure out is equal to gravitational pressure in. The exact maximum mass that this implies changes depending on the composition of the star - different elements are easier or more difficult for light to interact with. As a result, it's generally thought that the very first stars which contained only hydrogen and helium could reach somewhat higher masses than stars today. The exact number is still under investigation, but generally speaking better modelling has lowered the expected maximum mass of the first stars from about 1000 times the mass of the Sun to a couple hundred times the mass of the Sun. <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/773/2/185#references" target="_blank">This paper</a> even suggests that because of the intense radiative feedback during formation from the faster-than-generally-true-today accretion rate, the first stars may even have been <em>lower</em> mass than the most massive stars today, which is certainly counter-intuitive. </p>
<p>It's hard to measure the maximum mass of stars today, even, just because the more massive a star is, the more <strong>rare</strong> it is to make and the <strong>briefer</strong> its life is. The most massive stars we can see may not be the true upper limit, just because more massive ones are less likely to exist when we're looking. </p>
<p>Generally, though, &quot;about 150-200 times the mass of the Sun...ish&quot; is the conventional wisdom of the day.</p>
<p>Since black holes can continue to grow after they are made, and even merge, there's no theoretical upper limit to how big they can get. Though there <em>is</em> the same Eddington limit that restricts how <em>quickly</em> they can get big. As material falls into the black hole, it generates light (even more efficiently than nuclear fusion!) which then pushes out against new material falling in. When that pressure gets stronger than the gravitational pressure, material gets blow out instead of falling in. The generally quoted &quot;Eddington limit&quot; rate assumes <em>spherical</em> accretion though, and also a certain composition, both of which are not good assumptions, so we can certainly see some &quot;Super-Eddington&quot; objects called &quot;Ultra-luminous X-ray sources&quot; (ULXs for short). Some ULXs are still suspiciously bright under assumptions of a thin disk accretion model as well. Some people have claimed these as extremely massive black holes in between the kind that result from dead stars and the supermassive ones at the centers of galaxies based on their luminosity, but the only one I personally find convincing at this point as an &quot;intermediate mass black hole&quot; is HLX-1, and it may more properly turn out to be a supermassive black hole from an earlier small galaxy that was merged with its larger current one, though a few others might also turn out to be IMBHs as well. A few ULXs are even definitely neutron stars and not black holes at all - <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3590" target="_blank">they show pulsations from rotation</a>. The linked object is a neutron star accreting at about 100 times the Eddington rate!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/lmxbftw's answer is a very good one, though it's worth pointing out that their limit only applies to stars in equilibrium. Under the right circumstances, stars can be temporarily much larger. For example, in the early universe, there were probably <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08911" target="_blank">supermassive stars with the mass 100,000 times larger than our Sun</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
