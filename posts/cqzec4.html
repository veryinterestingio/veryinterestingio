		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dvd's and Blu-rays have the audio mastered in surround sound. Voices are typically sent through the center channel, while background noises and action come through all of the other speakers (typically, 4).</p>
<p>When played through a stereo, headphones, or a TV, all of those channels of audio are played through only 2 speakers.</p>
<p>Depending on how the engineers master the audio, and how your device decodes the signal, you sometimes wind up with those 4 channels of other noise overpowering the one channel of voice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dear OP what you're experiencing is dynamic range, or the difference between the loudest sounds, and the softest sounds, in a recording. Modern pop music tends to have a low dynamic range, where the volume of the music doesn't change very much, and the difference between the loudest part of a song, and the quietest part, is not that high. </p>
<p>Movies on the other hand need to have dynamic headroom (room to get LOUD) so that explosions and sound effects retain their impact. Movie soundtracks have a very high dynamic range, and so you have to turn the volume up much higher, to make dialogue sound loud enough, but then when the explosions come, your drink vibrates off the table. </p>
<p>Most stereos and DVD/Bluray players have a setting to change the dynamic compression from off, low, medium, or high. The higher you set this, the less the difference between loud and quiet is, which makes it useful for listening to a movie more quietly, and makes the audio more intelligible without having to turn the volume up higher.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Movies tend to be mastered for cinemas, with a good speaker setup, a quiet viewing experience and the expectation to get deafeningly loud occasionally. This is not the typical TV-watching experience, but often, movie releases will not give you a more TV-friendly master.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
