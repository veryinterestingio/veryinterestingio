		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Advice given to pregnant women to avoid nuts (for no good/discernible reason) for decades... now completely reversed (the official advice is &quot;don't avoid nuts&quot;).</p>
<p>Not being exposed to nuts, the antibodies/immunity information in your mother's blood isn't  transferred to baby, baby gets born, has no exposure and thus the first exposure triggers an allergic reaction as the immune system believes it's a foreign body.</p>
<p>If they'd been exposed to nuts in the womb, they'd inherit the mother's immunity, properly recognise the parts of the nuts in the blood that would trigger a reaction, and it would never be a problem.</p>
<p>What we have done over the last two generations is *given* a whole load of people a nut allergy by telling mothers to avoid nuts in pregnancy.  And now we have two generations of mothers who are allergic to nuts... which means they'll avoid nuts... and pass that allergy down.</p>
<p>This is why when I was a child, anyone with a nut allergy was very rare and it was extremely fatal.  Nowadays, every school has a dozen kids who have to carry epipens and the like to combat the allergic reaction.</p>
<p>The NHS literally admitted as such, there are papers everywhere, and the official advice has changed from even 10-15 years ago to say &quot;don't avoid nuts&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s not common, just generally more severe than other allergies when you have it. It’s simply the human body identifies the proteins in the nuts as pathogens and reacts so quickly, it reacts in the mouth and throat. The human body is generally impressively durable but this is one case where the body can kill itself in trying to avoid dying.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually with food allergies there is a certain protein or enzyme that your body deems to be a foriegn attack body like a disease so your bodies immune system reacts to it. Nuts just usually generate a very strong response.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Any allergy whether it is to nuts or another substance is just an extreme response by your immune system to something that it &quot;views&quot; as foreign. When a bacteria enters the body, your body &quot;sees&quot; it as something that is not supposed to be there. Your immune system goes into action then kills it and removes it. Unfortunately sometimes your body has very large immune responses to things that aren't really harmful, such as nuts, or cat hair, or dust. In your mind you know it's not harmful to you, but your body does not, so it thinks it is under attack and fights it off - sometimes very aggressively. When the immune system really ramps up it can cause a release of chemicals (histamine) so big that leads to redness, itchiness, and inflammation.</p>
<p>As for why nut allergies are more common I'm not sure. I'm a pharmacist not an allergist.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm not entirely convinced nut allergies are more common than others. They can be more severe on average or life threatening which is why many people may think they're more common just because they're more memorable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
