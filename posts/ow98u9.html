<p>Edit: thank you all so much for taking the time to answer my question! I've loved reading all your responses and I've learned loads (the WW2 doctor thing and how different patients/body parts respond is so fascinating). I'm just starting my immunology units at university, and I can't wait to hear more about everything you guys have mentioned!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Certain types of molecules are more likely to stimulate an immune response. Implants such as Nexplanon are made from less-reactive materials for this reason. </p>
<p>We started figuring this out during WW2, doctors were treating fighter pilots whose canopies had been shot out and they had shards of debris in their eyes. They soon figured out that the body didn’t react to the plastic used to make the canopies. </p>
<p>Based on this they figured out how to make contact lenses out of the same plastic, and avoid irritating the eye.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm just a simple medical doctor but this is a fascinating topic I wish I understood better.</p>
<p>Pretty much every person seem's to &quot;notice&quot; if something is in the body because there's basically always forms a &quot;capsule&quot; of reactive tissue around anything that's implanted in the soft tissues whether it be a breast implant or a &quot;port&quot; style central catheter which we may use for chemotherapy.   The vast majority of patients will tolerate these just fine because of their composition and the body sorta says &quot;Ok, I know you're not supposed to be here, but I'm not going to make a big fuss about it&quot;.  </p>
<p>Now imagine instead of an implanon you instead somehow got a big splinter of wood in a similar place under your skin.  Chronic foreign bodies like this instead continually &quot;rile up&quot; the body at a low level.  So instead of making that inert capsule it continually drives inflammation and often there develops a &quot;sinus tract' to the skin where pus and gross stuff leaks out.</p>
<p>The real interesting thing are the medical devices that are benign for some patients (but not others) and even ones that are okay in one spot of a person's body but cause inflammation in another area!  For the former, we know that at a low level breast implants can raise the risk of certain lymphoproliferative disorder/lymphoma, presumably due to long standing low levels of activation related to the foreign body.   </p>
<p>For the latter, I was recently involved in such a puzzling case.  To keep things vague the patient had a surgery and the same surgical material (sutures, clips)  was used in two separate but adjacent areas.   One area the patient tolerated just fine.  The other, they developed chronic inflammation, pain, and a draining sinus tract which requires dissecting out the suture and surgical clips that were (intentionally) left.  Why did their body decide to hate on the one site and not the other?  Was their more local tissue damage at one then the other that started and inflammatory cascade?  Cultures for bacteria at the site were negative but had the patient had an infection at one point that drove the body's response?  No clear answers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You asked specifically about the “arm implant”, but I feel like it’s worth mentioning that IUDs, which are cervical implants, actually work in part by keeping the area in a constant state of inflammation. And while the immune system isn’t exactly able to expel it, there are rare cases where the uterus will try to expel it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like you, I used to think that the body will attack any foreign material placed inside it. But I found out that many materials produce no response from the body. When a metal implant was screwed into one of my broken bones I wondered what the implant was made of. Turned out to be plain stainless steel. It provokes no response from the body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your immune system has a priority/ preference list (a few of these lists actually). The higher up you are on this list, the more severe an immune response you provoke. The list goes like this, from most severe to least severe response: </p>
<p>Heavy proteins&gt;light proteins&gt;polysaccharides&gt; nucleic acids&gt;lipids</p>
<p>Note I didn't mention metals or silicone or teflon. That's because inorganic materials usually do not induce a response that organic materials classically do (Opsonization, ADCC, Complement pathway activation etc). They do provoke an inflammatory response like a hernia mesh or a MicroEssure device would. But in the case of Implanon, we've engineered it so that it is as inert as possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
