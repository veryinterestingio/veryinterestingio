		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you keep adding terrestrial planetary material (mostly iron, silicon and oxygen) to a planet eventually it will resemble a white dwarf star. The radius will peak at only a few times that of Earth, depending on the exact composition, then start decreasing again. When you reach 1.44 times the mass of the Sun, or about half a million Earth masses, the planet/star will collapse, nuclear fusion will ignite and the resulting type 1a supernova will completely destroy the planet/star leaving no remnant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends what you mean by <em>size</em> — <em>mass</em> or <em>diameter</em>.</p>
<p>Our current models of planet formation suggest that at around ten times Earth’s mass a terrestrial planet would begin to accumulate and retain a dense and thick (in terms of how deep it is relative to the planet’s overall diameter) atmosphere, and begin to look like a small gas giant. Assuming the same density as Earth, such a planet would have a diameter of about 2.2 times that of Earth, around 27,500km – at least for the rocky core.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So far no one has given a plausible answer that isn't based on mass, but diameter, which I feel is what OP was asking for when he said &quot;maximum size&quot;</p>
<p>For example if we replaced the iron in our planet's core with silicon we could increase the radius to around 15,000km (3x) and the surface area to almost 10 times as large while only doubling the gravity.</p>
<p>This is still within the range of plausible planet formation. But I have a feeling that OP was wondering what the limits of planet formation are in this respect. How big of a solid rocky planet could we get while still being a terrestrial planet, or super earth?</p>
<p>edit: While looking around for some planetary mass/radius/density/compression calculators I came across this article, which, while limited, is a neat take on this. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/world-wide-mind/201211/do-super-earths-have-too-much-gravity-us" target="_blank">https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/world-wide-mind/201211/do-super-earths-have-too-much-gravity-us</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's conceivable that a Neptune-like gas giant could be impacted by a large terrestrial planet, causing the ejection of virtually all the gas giant's atmosphere/volatiles well after planetary formation in a system has finished. If the core of the former gas giant manages to stay in one piece, the resulting trainwreck may look like an enormous terrestrial planet, substantially bigger than what planetary formation models would suggest is possible. </p>
<p>However, even ignoring gas accretion from space, over geological timescales it would regenerate a large helium atmosphere due to the radioactive decay of its constituent rocks (alpha particles turn into helium). This would eventually make it look like a gas giant again.</p>
<p>So the answer is: really big, maybe even dozens of times more massive than Earth, if a lot of unusual circumstances add up and you happen to look at just the right time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There have been some fantastic answers about mass, so let's talk about organic life.   </p>
<p>A tardigrades is what I would consider the gold standard for life to survive in exceptional circumstances. The tardigrade can withstand 16000 times the gravity of earth.    </p>
<p>Some bacteria can survive up to 400k times the earth's gravity.    </p>
<p>I wish I could find information on how much gravity it takes to break down carbon molecules, but it must be astounding. I believe you would need to be approaching a black hole to ascertain such force. I believe there is an argument that amino acids would stay connected together all the way up until the planet collapsed in on itself.   </p>
<p>Life would look completely different, but could likely form and survive on such a supernatural planet. Keep in mind the the examples provided already exist on a planet that doesn't require a huge gravitational load. Imagine what would happen if life had to select for that trait.  </p>
<p>Thanks for question op, this was fantastic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
