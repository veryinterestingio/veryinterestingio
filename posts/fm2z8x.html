		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cardiovascular physiologist with extensive exercise physiology experience here.</p>
<p>Couple of things first - cardiac muscle is fundamentally different compared to skeletal muscle. Although certain contractile proteins are similar, in terms of energetics (energy production and consumption), cardiomyocytes (heart cells) are very different. </p>
<p>The main reason why cardiomyocytes are so resistant to fatigue is because they contain almost twice the amount of mitochondria. Mitochondria are the <strong>aerobic</strong> cellular powerhouse. We know this by looking at the content of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4121645/#!po=35.0000" target="_blank">citric synthase which tracks very well with mitochondrial content.</a></p>
<p>The heart is very metabolically flexible in terms of fuel. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2290415/" target="_blank">It consumes glucose, free fatty acid and <strong>lactate.</strong> Yes.. you read that right. It consumes lactate (so does skeletal muscle).</a> This is especially pronounced at high exercise intensities.</p>
<p>Finally, cardiomyocytes are very well vascularized and since they have more mitochondria are incredibly good at extracting oxygen and using it for aerobic respiration. In fact, even at the rest heart muscle pretty much extracts most usable oxygen from blood which means the only way for the heart to improve oxygen delivery is to improve flow (as it cannot improve on extraction).</p>
<p>These are just some broad concepts but I recommend taking a look at some exercise physiology texts that will help.</p>
<p>Obligatory edit - Woah! this blew up. RIP my inbox. </p>
<p>Thanks for the kind words. Going to try to answer the most common questions asked here.</p>
<p><strong>One common question is - what would happen if we replaced all muscle in the body with cardiac muscle?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong> </p>
<p>Lots of bad things. Cardiac cells talk to each other through a structure called the intercalated disk which allows all cardiomyocytes to beat synchronously to produce an effective beat. Further, cardiomyocytes are self-excitatory i.e. they contract even without nerve supply (that's why a transplanted heart with its nerves cut still beats - a lot faster rate too because the heart needs the vagus nerve to rein it in). Obviously both of these would be very bad for skeletal muscle as these are incompatible with voluntary, purposeful movements. First, it's precisely because muscle fibers in a motor unit are isolated from others that we're capable of effective movements otherwise a contraction that started in one fiber would rapidly spread to others. Secondly, you can only imagine how bad it would be if skeletal muscle cells started to contract by themselves without any nervous system input. Ninja edit - oh and one more thing, the <a href="https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2000.tb06470.x?sid=nlm%3Apubmed" target="_blank">metabolic rate of cardiac tissue per unit mass is almost 35-times greater</a> than skeletal muscle (440 kcal/kg per day vs 13 kcal/kg per day). If we replaced skeletal muscle with cardiac muscle our daily energetic needs would skyrocket given that skeletal muscle is a substantial percentage of our body mass/weight.</p>
<p><strong>Another common question - some variation of; does the heart only have a set number of beats and if I speed my heart up with exercise am I draining it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>Not true and please don't stop exercising. If anything, exercise revs up your heart (esp cardio; weight training has very modest cardiac effects) during exercise and that's a good thing (if your heart rate doesn't go up that's bad and called chronotropic incompetence). That's because over time you get what's called eccentric hypertrophy so your heart can pump more blood out per beat (increased stroke volume). Further, regular cardio also increases vagal tone (the vagus is the nerve that slows the heart rate) and this in combination with the increased stroke volume means you get a very nice resting heart rate. <a href="https://heart.bmj.com/content/99/12/882" target="_blank">Low resting heart rates</a> and [high cardiorespiratory fitness] (<a href="https://mayocl.in/2WzpBok" target="_blank">https://mayocl.in/2WzpBok</a>) VO2max (or VO2peak) are associated with significantly lower risks of heart disease and all-cause mortality.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In fact, the final enzyme in the creation of lactic acid, lactate dehydrogenase, works <em>in reverse</em> in heart cells! It actually <em>consumes</em> lactic acid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The heart contains a different type of muscle tissue - cardiac muscle tissue. While cardiac tissue has the same organisation as skeletal muscle, its fibers are much shorter, so the force the heart has to exert is far less than that of skeletal muscle. </p>
<p>Cardiac muscle cells contain a much greater number of mitochondria per cell.  These provide energy in the form of ATP, at a much greater rate than skeletal msucle.</p>
<p>Being as close to the heart (because it is the heart), cardiac muscle also has a constant fresh supply of blood, providing vital oxygen and nutrients. This along with the factors mentioned above, make the heart much less susceptible to fatigue when compared to skeletal muscle.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although the reason was already mentioned, you could also consider, that the heart takes breaks and the muscles of the heart relax during diastole. The breaks usually take up the same time as the contraction(sistole) (if the heart doesn't get much workload, though) so the muscle has enough time to rest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If your arms are tired of beating, stop beating for a few days.</p>
<p>Also vast difference in force between the coordinated contraction of many individual cardiomyocytes to generate a beat, and the contraction of long multinucleate skeletal muscle fibres pulling on sections of your skeleton. And cardiomyocytes have the highest density of mitochondria, and high vascularisation delivers plenty of oxygen while clearing any lactic acid (to give you some idea just how much the body values that organ being in the best shape it can be to keep beating).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
