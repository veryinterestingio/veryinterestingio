		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no fundamental reason preventing sound from traveling faster than light in some contrived medium or structure (although I don't know of any experiments where this has been demonstrated), but you need to be careful about what you define &quot;sound&quot; and &quot;light&quot; to be.</p>
<p>In Lene Hau's <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/17561" target="_blank">famous paper</a>, light was slowed to 17m/s in a sodium BEC. BECs are typically opaque, but the setup used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetically_induced_transparency" target="_blank">electromagnetically induced transparency</a> to allow light to propagate through the BEC; the incident photons coupled with the sodium atoms to form massive quasiparticles called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polariton" target="_blank">polaritons</a>, which account for the slowdown factor of \~20M. (For those asking, the speed of sound in a similar sodium BEC is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4774" target="_blank">about 2mm/s</a>, so light still travels faster than sound here. Also, as pointed out in some other comments, introducing sound to the BEC might add enough energy to alter its state.) It is morally correct but technically nondescript to simply say that light slows down in their setup.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light is an electromagnetic phenomenon, whereas sound is a compression wave. I see no reason why a compression wave couldn't travel through a medium where light was slowed. Sound generally travels through solids at a rate of thousands of meters per second. The only problem I foresee is that a compression wave being introduced to the system may add enough energy to the system to affect the conditions used to slow the light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Well...technically, any opaque solid. I can't see the incredibly loud group of guys in the lunchroom next to my office, but I can sure hear them.</p>
<p>I realize I'm being pedantic here because I'm assuming you meant &quot;any medium that allows light and sound to travel through it.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depending on how you view your question, you could get an interesting response.
Because of you want to hear something before you see it, then making the distance between you and the even harder for light but easier for sound is manageable.
If you look through a maze of mirrors, your technically increasing the amount of time it takes for the light to get to you, as you’re increasing distance.
Technically, you could make a long and complicated enough visual mechanism that would make it so you didn’t see light until after you heard a sound.</p>
<p>I know it’s not exactly what you were thinking, but it is a way to make it happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
