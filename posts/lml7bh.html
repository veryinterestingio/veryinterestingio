		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How soon do you think you'll be able to roll out service tied to the EAS and WEA systems so people just get alerts on their cell phones?  Is that system capable of delivery alerts fast enough to matter, or do you think it'll have to stay app-based forever to give you finer control over the delivery speed and mechanism of alerts?</p>
<p>Is there any way to crowdsource seismic data, e.g. by listening to the accelerometer data on millions of smartphones to pick up earthquakes in areas that are underserved by traditional seismometers?  Similarly, is there any sort of low-cost seismo installation hobbyists/volunteers could install in their backyard to bolster the sensor network?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This week, there was an earthquake in Japan that was identified as an aftershock of earthquakes in 2011.  How did scientists determine that this earthquake was related to the previous one?  Is there a way to predict that a serious aftershock might still occur as long as 10 years afterward, do scientists monitor for this risk?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>What challenges do you face in communicating with the public about earthquakes? How do you overcome them?</p>
<p>I am specifically interested in how you incorporate uncertainty into your communications. For example, a high likelihood of an event but that likelihood has error bars around it. This can be particularly tricky in data visualization, but it’s also hard to communicate that in written form to the public, particularly when risk is involved. How do you work through that?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
