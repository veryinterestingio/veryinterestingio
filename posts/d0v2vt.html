		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They already do. Tiger populations in Asia, for instance, are extremely fractured because their territories are separated by human development. As a consequence, problems resulting from inbreeding are very common.</p>
<p>There's a lot of species that are still doing fine in terms of numbers but are threatened because their population is spread apart and isolated to the detriment of the gene pool.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but this is where zoos come in (theoretically).  Accredited zoos have something called a Species Survival Plan for each species, in which they've mapped out the greatest possible genetic diversity available within the captive population for generations down the line and breed each animal accordingly.  </p>
<p>In theory, this keeps a viable population alive, even if a species is driven to extinction in the wild.  In the right situation, that species could be reintroduced to its native habitat, but the threat that drove it to that point would have to be gone.  Given humanity's current track record, including recklessly torching the Amazon, that's a rare situation (although not impossible, as shown with the reintroduction of California condors and some wolf packs, etc).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is one of the reasons why zoos are incredibly important and ultimately beneficial to the health of a species. By engaging in &quot;breeding programs&quot; they're able to provide each other with mating animals that will most effectively produce a genetically diverse population.</p>
<p>The same exists in other areas of conservation. For example, the present stock of American Bison is so heavily polluted by cattle genetics that every animal has to be tested at the Nature Conservancy's Nachusa Grasslands reserve in Illinois to determine their authenticity as pure bison. Using this knowledge they can then trade bison with other reserves to introduce new genetic material. This not only helps to reduce the potential for poor diversity, but also dilution of the genetic material that makes the species itself.</p>
<p>Prior to the advances in genetic testing that we have today, the inbreeding problem was a much bigger issue. It's still a problem in wild populations where bottlenecks are common in highly threatened species that are impacted through natural occurrences. With advances in gene editing it may be possible to subvert this problem all together, but then of course you open up the issue of authenticity.</p>
<p>Wildlife conservation is a much muddier and challenging task than it might seem to an outside observer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is happening with buffalo in the American west. The population was brought to dangerously low numbers by overhunting and inbreeding became a very common occurrence in wild populations. The people that breed them for conservation and farming have to be very careful in reviewing any available genealogical history so that they don't inbreed. Luckily, the population has been increasing so the risk of inbreeding has dropped.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cheetahs had a bottleneck of what is believed to be 8 individuals 10,000 years ago. They can all give each other skin grafts, but if some debilitating disease comes along that impacts one it will probably impact all. The lack of genetic diversity will make them less resilient against future threats, which means they will need continued conservation efforts even after they have 'recovered'.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
