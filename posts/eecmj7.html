		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depending on your definition of mountain, there are several ways. Volcanoes form over hotspots in the mantle, like the Hawaiian island chain and probably Olympus Mons on Mars. Asteroid bombardment can also cause piling of crater ejecta (like the Montes Jura on the north-western nearside of the Moon) or simply have raised crater rims that become partially eroded through other processes or subsequent impacts.</p>
<p>Also, for very large impacts, the center of the crater often forms a fairly sharp peak due to the crater base &quot;bouncing back&quot;, which could be argued to be a mountain.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, there is a moon of Saturn, Iapetus which if you look at pictures appears to have a mountain range around its equator. This is thought to possibly be caused by a moon of the moon being pulled apart by tidal forces and slowly deorbiting bit by bit leaving a ring of mountains under its former orbit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few comments explaining various ways mountains form while the planets were still tectonically active. However, even after a planet's mantle and core have cooled, it is still possible for mountains to be formed. </p>
<p>Large enough impacts can cause depressions so large that the rim of the crater rises so high that it could be considered a circular mountain range, Mercury, for example has one of the largest impact craters in the solar system, known as &quot;Caloris Planitia&quot;, which is almost 1000 miles in diameter and is surrounded by the &quot;Caloris Montes&quot;, a ring of mountains around the crater.</p>
<p>But this is only half the story. As seen by NASA's MESSENGER probe, at the exact antipode (opposite side of the planet) of the Caloris Planitia, there is a massive region of hills and mountains called the chaotic terrain. It is hypothesized (and likely true) that this massive impact caused the calores planitia and sent highly energetic shockwaves rippling through Mercurys crust. These seismic waves traveled across the planet all converged at the antipode of the impact and forced the terrain the crunch and squeeze, resulting in a large mountainous area. This impact is thought to be so energetic that it temporarily reactivated volcanic activity on Mercury which resulted in the formation of smooth, unblemished plains on the planet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To the best of my knowledge, mountains simply can't form on non-tectonic planets.
But from what we know of rocky planet formation, all basically rocky planets go through a tectonic stage. Rocky bodies big enough to become planets go through a molten phase as the materials collect and compress under mutual gravitational attraction. They cool from the outside inwards, so there will always be a stage where chunks of crust can float and move on the still molten interior.</p>
<p>Mars, Venus and Mercury all had stages where tectonic plates could exist. Mountains were formed as a result and the planet later cooled to the point where plates were not active any more. And without a weather system to cycle a liquid from surface to air and back again, erosion happens very very slowly. </p>
<p>The Appalachian mountains are roughly 480 million years old. They've been pummelled by rain and snow for many millennia yet are still quite prominent. A Martian mountain, subject only to weak winds from a thin atmosphere would erode far slower than that.</p>
<p>In our Solar System, Earth is in a &quot;Goldilocks Zone&quot; in more than just being the right distance from the Sun to have water. It is also large enough too hold on to a lot of the atmosphere it started with (so it can have a noticeable weather that collects water from the surface lowlands and rain it down on the mountains) and has heating in the core to keep a semi liquid mantle for the continental plates to float on for billions off years after it was first formed. </p>
<p>I don't know enough to be certain, but it's possible that the impact with another body that led to the creation of the Moon may have helped keep things hot and moving. Certainly tidal stresses from the Moon orbiting us has helped. I know that no other planet in our system comes nearly as close to being a double planet as the Earth/Moon pairing. The constant tug of the tides affects the plates as much as it does the oceans, it's just less noticeable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
