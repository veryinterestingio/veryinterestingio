		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are assuming that hosts are targets. Usually when a virus kills its host it is because it evolved to be in something else and made a jump into a new species. All of the deadly plagues in human history were zoological in origin.</p>
<p>Viruses do best in a host that has some immunity to it. Not so much that the viruses all get wiped out but enough that their reproduction doesn't go unchecked. Think of it almost like a predator/prey relationship. If there is enough food the predator does well and there are more of them, but too many and they overwhelm their prey and now there isn't enough food, so they die off.</p>
<p>Every ecosystem is a balancing act.</p>
<p>Edit: Wow. Thank you for the awards!</p>
<p>Yes, reproduce probably wasn't the best choice of words. They aren't alive but that might be more about our definition of life than their biology. Copies are made and sometimes those copies are slightly different. But that's for the folks who dedicate their lives to this to hash out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer no, super deadly viruses don’t spread much if they kill the host too rapidly, that is part of why the original SARS didn’t spread at much as COVID. </p>
<p>Historically, there is documentation of several “plagues” in which the documented symptoms don’t match any known disease, so some assume these were too deadly viruses that jumped too humans and killed a bunch of people quickly causing their own extinction. </p>
<p>This is why COVID is the epidemiologist nightmare, it spreads before it is symptomatic and is not severe enough to scare all people into taking it seriously, as opposed to something like Ebola where dying a horrible and quick death is enough to scare people into taking precautions seriously.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, pathogens evolve toward improved transmission, and virulence is only secondarily affected.</p>
<p>There's a widespread amateur idea that pathogens evolve toward reduced virulence &quot;because it doesn't do any good to kill its host&quot;, but that's absolutely wrong. I suspect it's so popular because it buys into the common misunderstanding of evolution having a goal - of course evolution does not have goals or planning, and there's no way for a pathogen to look ahead and predict that killing its host today will lead to a shortage of hosts for its offspring in fifty years' time. (In fact, given the long-lasting immunity that many pathogens drive, after infection a host is usually effectively dead to the pathogen in any case, since it can't be re-infected.)</p>
<p>This has been <em>very</em> extensively researched, by many people. A starting point is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5587421/" target="_blank">The evolution of virulence and emerging diseases</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifically, dangerous pathogens can be distinguished from those that pose relatively little threat by identifying characteristics that favor intense exploitation of hosts by pathogens, hence causing high virulence. Studies to date have implicated several such characteristics, including transmission by vectors, attendants, water, and durable propagules. These insights may improve the return on investments in disease control by directing effort and resources to the most-dangerous emerging pathogens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Transmission is linked to virulence, but not always in obvious ways. In many cases, reduced virulence will lead to improved transmission, and this may be especially true for respiratory pathogens with relatively low transmissibility to start with - this is a scenario where a less sick individual may mingle more and spread the disease better. But it's far more complicated than saying &quot;this always happens&quot; - See <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1004387#s4" target="_blank">Theory and Empiricism in Virulence Evolution</a> for other scenarios. The most important message is that this is complicated and your intuition is probably wrong.</p>
<p>We can easily point to two scenarios where transmission is enhanced by high virulence. In one case (rabbit myxoma disease in Australia) the initial very high virulence of the pathogen dropped somewhat (from 99.8% when the virus was first introduced in the early 1950s, to a stable 50% virulence that lasted for many years). The evolution of reduced, but still very high, virulence is because of increased transmission at this level:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The less-virulent virus took 3 to 4 weeks to kill a rabbit instead of 6 to 10 days, so that sick rabbits could be bitten by mosquitoes and fleas for 3 to 5 times as long as a rabbit suffering from the highly virulent strain. The milder strain was therefore more successful in infecting rabbits, and it spread rapidly. Through this selection the virus evolved to a less-virulent form.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it didn’t evolve further, to low virulence, because healthy rabbits groom away fleas and avoid mosquitos. An extremely sick rabbit, too sick to protect itself against parasites, but still alive (because fleas only bite live animals), is ideal for myxoma virus transmission. See <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2217926/" target="_blank">A comparison of the virulence for European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) of strains of myxoma virus recovered in the field in Australia, Europe and America</a>.  </p>
<p>In the case of rabbit calicivirus, also used for biological control of Australian rabbits. there's been no such reduction in virulence since it was introduced. This high-virulence strain is a mutation of a natural low-virulence virus (<a href="https://jvi.asm.org/content/83/23/12129" target="_blank">Origin and Phylodynamics of Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease</a>), and it's probably persisted because transmission is from rabbit carcasses to live rabbits, so the more dead rabbits, the better the transmission. </p>
<p>So bottom line, there are cases of evolution toward reduced virulence (though not very many, in spite of sweeping claims) - to higher virulence -- and to moderate virulence; and in each case, the driver is not the virulence itself, but the optimization of transmission.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most successful infections (be that viruses, bacteria or other parasites) are the ones which go undetected and spread easily. Killing the host is not in the interest of any of those, and actually stops the spread.</p>
<p>My favourite example for a well adapted parasite is the humble pinworm: it hardly affects the host (a bit of itching really is all), it is highly infectious (touch any surface after you scratched that itch and the eggs are all over the place... and as a result about 1 in 2 people have it at least at some point in their lives (would probably be much more if we hadn't got pretty good and easy to use medicine to get rid of it).</p>
<p>The worst are things like SARS, which kill you very quickly. Not much chance to spread to many new hosts if a virus does this...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Viruses kind of have to cause some level of damage to their host, because the whole reason they need a host is to borrow resources and reproductive faculties from them. It’s not so much an evolutionary benefit as it is a side effect that their host suffers when they succeed, especially in the case of viruses since they must literally kill host cells in order to reproduce. Of course, outright killing the whole host is not usually a good idea for the virus since it now needs to find a new host, but this is why most deadly viruses that exist today only exist because they are not deadly to the hosts that they originally evolved alongside. COVID-19 for example came from bats which have notoriously powerful immune systems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
