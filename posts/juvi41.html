		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a combination of several things:  </p>
<ol>
<li>Context. Like most languages, you can understand the meaning of a phrase even if you don't understand every word in it, so long as you understand the overall context.  </li>
<li>Syntax. I'm not perfectly fluent in Mandarin, so I may be a bit wrong here, but there are different ways to portray the same meaning, and the language itself gives way to a lot of word play. Careful structuring of syntax allows the singer to portray the same meaning when the words are not necessarily set up in the same order you would use them in other situations. You see this a lot in certain Chinese poetry where everything is 4 characters and can portray a whole litany of ideas and thoughts.  </li>
<li>Tones + Context. Chinese is definitely a tonal language, but it's not necessarily rigid. If you listen to some Chinese rap, the tones of some words (by themselves at least) feel almost flat or different from what the lyrics says it should be. However, put into context of every character around it, the listener can understand the word itself and by extension the line. I suppose the closest analogy I can make to this is taking out vowels in the English language. So long as some of what you are familiar with is still there, a few adjustments here and there makes no difference to your understanding.</li>
</ol>
<p>Edit: it's important to note that even with the three things above, lyrics will often be misheard or misunderstood regardless of your fluency in the language. It's part of the reason why in China, any music accompanied by visuals will include subtitles, and the most popular musical events are stuff like the Spring Gala show (I always called this the Chinese New Year show that most Chinese families watch).
The reasons for this usually comes down to the change of tones in order to fit the song, and the thickness of the singer's accent/dialect coming through in the song (assuming the song is in Mandarin).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For Mandarin Chinese at least, each &quot;tone&quot; isn't actually a tone/pitch. Each syllable's &quot;tone&quot; is actually primarily determined by the relative change in pitch during the syllable. So the four tones are (primarily):  constant, rising, falling-then-rising, and falling. It's of course slightly more nuanced than that (e.g. the &quot;constant&quot; tone's pitch is expected to be somewhat high relative to the average of the syllables).</p>
<p>Also.. there are a lot of different Chinese dialects. There seems to be a lot of variation in how crucial tone is to people of each dialect. For some dialects, they hardly care at all and they're very flexible -- and the words are such that they're more uniquely discernible even without consideration of tone. &quot;Standard&quot; Mandarin (similar to Beijing dialect, but with fewer gratuitous &quot;R&quot; sounds added to the ends of syllables) happens to be (as far as I can tell) one of the most particular when it comes to tone. However, people in Beijing seem to be pretty flexible about letting the last syllable or two of a sentence deviate from what the formal tone would be expected to be (sometimes, it just kind of trails off - and that's fine).</p>
<p>In songs, people often take liberties with the syllables and they're not exact. Similar to as is the case in English, it may make things more difficult to understand, but people don't necessarily care. Also, individuals may happen to prefer people with unusual accents - like Singaporean or whatever (similar to how many Americans might personally feel that British people tend to have nicer singing voices even though they talk funny).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not an explanation but a fun side note; some online songs deliberately made use of the fact that singing blurs tone and pronunciation. The reason being to hide swear words, and political criticism. It took off on Baidu. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other answers in this thread, the songs are written so that the melody follows the tones a little bit. It comes naturally to Chinese songwriters. It's like how, in English, when words have stressed and unstressed syllables, songwriters naturally tend to place stressed syllables on the strong beats.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
