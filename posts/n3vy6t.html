		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>200+ db doesn't really exist. At 194 db, the sound is so loud that it's creating vacuums between the sound waves. Any louder, and it isn't really a sound wave anymore, just a shock wave. Rocket launches can reach 165 db, but that's still fifteen decibels lower than Krakatoa.</p>
<p>As to why Krakatoa was heard so far away, volcanoes are geological activity: the earth itself was producing the sound and helping it travel. Think of it like a phone on vibrate. If it vibrates in your hand, you can only hear it a few feet away. However, if you place the same phone on a table, you can clearly hear it from across the room. In the same way, a rocket engine suspended above the ground will not be heard from as far away as a volcano erupting within the earth.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It does not make sense to measure sound like this. That is why you get these strange numbers. The atmosphere is not able to support sounds of over about 180 dB because at that point you start creating complete vacuum. This is why lound noises like rocket launches sounds like they are recorded on a broken microphone, it is not the microphone that is broken but the air itself. So these numbers you are quoting can not possibly be recorded accuratly or even calucated after the fact because they just did not happen like that. So when comparing lound noises like volcano eruptions and rocket launches you have to take into account how large of a volume they can create that sound in. So you calculate a total energy output instead of a dB number. And the bigger the explosion, the more energy in it, the louder the sound will be at a fixed distance where the sound can actually be measured and make sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to intensity there is frequency of noise.  The tone or pitch, if you will.  Very low pitched sounds travel much farther than high pitched sounds, regardless of decibel level.  A rumbling caldera probably had some very low pitched sounds that travelled some extreme distances.  I also find it dubious that the volcano was ONLY 180 db.  Sound follows the inverse square law, so Iâ€™m curious what the sound at the source of eruption would have been.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
