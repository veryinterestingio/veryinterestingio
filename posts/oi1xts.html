How are these temperatures measured? Wouldn't any device that could do it be destroyed? Is it just like an assumption that is made based on how much energy is put into the system? How do they know that it is &quot;really&quot; that heat and that there aren't other factors (like inefficiency or problems with the insulation materials) that cause the heat to be different?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mainly, with very powerful lasers. As you say, any instrument which measured the temperature by being in contact with the plasma would (a) quickly be destroyed, and (b) quickly cool down and ruin the plasma itself in the process, so we have to measure the temperature by &quot;remote sensing&quot; methods with don't require physical contact.</p>
<p>One of the main methods for doing this is taking advantage of an effect called Thomson Scattering. A very high power pulsed laser is fired through the plasma, and a small proportion of the light undergoes Thomson Scattering, which is elastic scattering off the electrons in the plasma. This scattered light picks up a Doppler shift from the velocity of the electrons, so the spectrum of the scattered light takes on a shape related to the velocity distribution of the electrons. Since temperature is a measure of the velocity distribution, the spectrum of the scattered light can be used to determine the temperature of the electrons in the plasma. The scattered light is collected by a large lens viewing side-on to the laser beam, and then sent to spectrometers where the spectrum can be measured and so the plasma temperature determined. By analysing the spectrum at different points along the laser beam as it goes through the plasma, you can measure the the temperature profile across the plasma.</p>
<p>When Russian scientists first started claiming high plasma temperatures in the, at the time, new Tokamak designs, confirming those temperatures was a hot topic. At the height of the cold war a team of scientists from the UK who were the world experts in making plasma temperature measurements with Thomson Scattering went to Russia to set up a Thomson scattering system and confirmed the Russian results. One of them wrote <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LASERS-ACROSS-CHERRY-ORCHARDS-scientificand-ebook/dp/B01IY7TFIS" target="_blank">a book about it.</a></p>
<p>EDIT: thank you kind internet strangers for the awards and positive comments, I'm glad this comment was useful! I don't often find myself at the right place &amp; time to usefully contribute to Reddit threads!</p>
<p>EDIT2: For anyone interested in the other main methods I also recommend directing your attention to u/<em>craq</em> 's comment which refers to electron cyclotron emission which is another very commonly used method.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main method in magnetically confined fusion experiments is Electron Cyclotron Emission, ECE. The electrons resonate with the magnetic field. Because the magnetic field is strongest in the middle and weaker at the outside, ECE can measure the temperature at different locations within the plasma.</p>

<p>You can also use Thomson scattering, Bremsstrahlung,  and Langmuir probes at the edge, but ECE is the main method. Collective Thomson Scattering can give you the ion temperature, or you can assume that is the same as the electron temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Langmuir probes, also lasers and radiation. </p>
<p>You are dealing with a plasma which has high energy but low density. You can use a probe that has a voltage charge across it and measure the plasma through electric fields to determine how many eV of energy it has. </p>
<p>When you are dealing with plasmas, the temperature is a distribution of energies. It’s not the way we think of hot steam. Temperature is the average distribution of kinetic energy of a system of particles. </p>
<p>I worked in a plasma lab on pulsed plasma experiments. We were trying to come up with mathematical correlations for the self healing properties of a lithium based fusion reactor wall after a confinement breach. So we would establish a rotating plasma, smash it into the lithium target under vacuum, and monitor the temperature distribution and flow of the wall material under the magnetic field until it filled in its own “holes” and solidified. I worked on the controls and displays side.</p>
<p>We would use Langmuir probes to ensure we had the energies (temperatures) needed to control the experiment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It hasn't been mentioned yet, but Temperature reflects the propensity of a system to want to &quot;give away&quot; its energy, it isn't a direct measure of how much energy it actually has.</p>
<p>So something can be very hot by having a lot of energy in a small number of degrees of freedom, like overfilling a very small bucket, such that if it was to interact with anything, that energy would with high probability reduce in those degrees of freedom, but the actual amount of energy transferred would be low, because the number of degrees of freedom equilibrating was also low.</p>
<p>You can picture this like a tiny weight on a spring that is bouncing and wiggling around madly, and when it bumps into anything will just sort of slow down, but while it was not in contact with anything, the temperature was obviously visible in its degree of excitation, even if it wasn't a large amount of energy in the grand scheme of things.</p>
<p>(Another way to say this is that temperature is an &quot;intensive&quot; property, it doesn't give a sense of scale, and such properties tend to average or interact in more complex ways when you put the systems together, rather than simply add, unlike energy, where Total Energy is a meaningful quantity)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
