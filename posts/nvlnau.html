		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The disease was a death sentence but they did try. The most common treatment was a starvation diet where they limited both the intake of calories and carbohydrates this bought the child a small amount of time.  You were basically fed proteins.</p>
<p>Leonard Thompson, a 13 year old boy, was on such a diet when the experimental insulin treatment was being developed in 1922. The treatment failed numerous times because of it not being pure enough but Banting, Best, Collip and Macleod from the University of Toronto didn't give up and continued to refine and purify extracted insulin until it finally was able to work. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something worth noting... Even after insulin became available, type 1 diabetes had a high mortality rate until recently. A big change is a) synthetic insulin with different action profiles and b) ability to have small doses (0.025 units compared to &gt;= 1). Diabetes foundations award people who have had the disease for 50+ years with medals for good reason. My mum gets her 60th this year. Burn out is life threatening now but back then it was a death sentence. I’ve had it for 14 years (dx 19) and I’m not sure I would have been one of the survivors had I got it 60 years ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People didn't manage it, they died. While it has been recognized as a disease for a long time, there wasn't much that could be done by way of treatment.  In the late 1800s-early 1900s, the &quot;treatment&quot; they worked out was essentially a starvation diet. They figured it out because a group of diabetic patients stopped having sugar in their urine during intense rationing during a siege on Paris. Essentially these patients were starving to death but they lived longer this way than if they were to eat normally. It's pretty morbid to think that if you were diabetic back then all you could hope for was maybe a couple more years of painful starvation. In the 1920s  scientists had figured out how to isolate insulin and they were finally able to treat people (of course, the downside is that it came from pigs and cows until the 70s). If you're interested there was an episode of  a podcast I like called the memory palace which covered this topic, focusing on one of the first patients to be treated with insulin: <a href="https://thememorypalace.us/elizabeth/" target="_blank"><a href="https://thememorypalace.us/elizabeth/" target="_blank">https://thememorypalace.us/elizabeth/</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
