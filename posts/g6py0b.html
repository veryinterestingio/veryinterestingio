		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Long term, algae reduces the turtle's ability to raise its internal temperature thus causing it to move slower and be at more risk. Aquatic turtles are especially prone to this since so much time is spent in the water. Turtles shed their scutes naturally as a way to remove the algae, aquatic turtles more than others. As long as the woman doesn't scrub too hard, the turtle should be fine and some actually enjoy the scritches on their shell. Using a soft brush is fine, as long as the woman isn't using something with hard or metal bristles that will damage the shell it should be okay.</p>
<p>Turtles will shed their scutes so they can grow, recover from an injury to their shell, or to stave off infection and disease.</p>
<p>Edit: some questions regarding whether or not turtles can feel the scratching on their shells and whether they actually enjoy. Here's a good r/askscience post from a few years ago asking <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/36jmik/can_a_turtle_feel_something_touch_its_shell/" target="_blank">the same question.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well this is a question made for me! I can give you some insight as I am a sea turtle veterinarian :) Well, I should be but I'm stuck in lock down and not with my turtles.</p>
<p>Turtles will naturally get a number of what we call epibiontes living on them, such as algae, barnacles, crabs and even some fish. However in the wild, they generally won't build up to great amounts as a healthy turtle will get a lot of feeder fishing visiting them on the reefs and these fish will eat off that algae and debris. Win win for them both. Things like barnacles will get scrubbed off when the turtle rubs up against coral and rocks. Sick or debilitated turtles can get overgrowths of these organisms and in severe cases, these can actually weigh them down and cause drowning. A turtle with too many epibiontes is a concern and should be investigated as it is usually suffering from something underlying.</p>
<p>When a turtle is receiving veterinary care it will be living on its own in a tank without anything else in it, so we take over the role of those feeder fish basically, as large build ups can be detrimental to them. So the scrubbing is our way of mimicking as much as possible, a natural process. We use soft bristled tooth brushes.</p>
<p>So yes there is a big ecosystem effectively forming on the back of a turtle and generally it's kept in good symbiotic balance. We take over that process of cleaning when they're out of their normal habitat, but otherwise, it is a normal part of a sea turtles life.</p>
<p>Edit: I've just realised there may be a language barrier here. I'm from the UK and we have very distinct names for our chelonian friends. A turtle is a fully aquatic creature (with flippers and not feet!), a tortoise is a fully land dwelling creature and a terrapin is a bit of a mix of the two (semi-aquatic and tends to have webbed toes). But I've noticed that in the USA you just call everything a turtle so I don't know which one you were referring to in your question!)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
