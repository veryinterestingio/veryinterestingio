		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What I was told in Fields and Waves class is that a sequence of things happened,</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os_Qt89VokE" target="_blank">Maxwell fixed Ampere's law</a></li>
<li>This fix allowed deriving a wave equation from Maxwell's equations</li>
<li>Standard methods for finding the velocity of the electromagnetic wave yielded c</li>
</ol>
<p>And the key thing was that the speed of light was already known; it was c, determined experimentally. Finding that Maxwell's equations can calculate that light and electromagnetic waves are the same speed is a good indication that light is an electromagnetic wave. </p>
<p>That's how I remember the explanation from nearly a decade ago, so please feel free to correct me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are different types of radioactivity, only one of them (gamma radiation) is electromagnetic radiation.</p>
<p>Radio waves were discovered when working with electric currents, so that one was easy. For visible light, people measured that it has the same speed as an electromagnetic wave. It also shows diffraction similar to radio waves, and it interacts with electrons in the way we expect from electromagnetic radiation.</p>
<p>Gamma rays are roughly the nuclear physics equivalent to visible light for atoms - it also moves at the same speed, it can be reflected by crystals (which leads to a wavelength measurement), and it interacts with charged particles in the way we expect from electromagnetic radiation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is of note that it took over a decade for physicists to understand that X-rays were the same phenomena as other electromagnetic waves. They behaved similar to visible light in some respects, but not others. The chain of experiments that it took to figure this out is a long and technical one. X-rays were discovered by RÃ¶ntgen in 1896, but not until experiments in crystal diffraction in 1912 that it was proven that they were a form of very short-wavelength electromagnetic waves. Prior to that there were many theories about what they were, all with some evidence behind them: longitudinal vibrations in the ether, some kind of particular radiation, some kind of extreme ultraviolet radiation. One of the difficulties in figuring this out is the fact that they do exhibit both wave and particle properties, and the wave-particle nature of the quantum world was not at all understood at the time.</p>
<p>Which is only to say: like many things in the history of science, there are the &quot;simple&quot; answers that textbooks give, but the reality is usually pretty messy and unclear for a long time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
