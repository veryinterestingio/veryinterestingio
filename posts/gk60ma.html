		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't specifically about COVID but I read an article about a study on COVID that 99% of patients have developed anti bodies which gives good hope for the fact that people with mild symptoms might also develop them. Which indicates that in general people with mild symptoms of any virus might have a larger chance/risk of not developing anti bodies.</p>
<p>From my limited reasoning, mild symptoms would mean that your immune system managed to fight it early enough before more serious symptoms could develop themselves. But that also means anti bodies doesn't it? It's anti bodies that do the whole defending your body thing against that virus?</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I don't know the code of conduct here when you get your question answered but I just wanted to say thank you for so many in depth and well explained answers, caused me to dive deeper into some of the things you mentioned.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think it’s accurate to say they didn’t produce antibodies, but they didn’t produce antibodies that we can detect. The adaptive immune system refines itself over the course of an infection, to make highly specific antibodies. It’s these antibodies we are trying to detect with antibody tests. It’s also the B-cells that produce these antibodies that stick around long term as memory B-cells that form part of the immunity to viruses. T-cells are also needed as well, since they can kill infected cells.</p>
<p>However, if the infection doesn’t last long enough the adaptive immune system doesn’t really have enough time to refine enough to create those highly specific antibodies or make a good enough B-cell of T-cell to turn into a memory T-cell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Natural Killer Cells and some Macrophages do not need antibodies to identify an invader.</strong> The mechanism is complex, but basically they have a way to identify what cells are part of the body. If a cell is not part of the body, it is assumed to be an invader and is destroyed. NK cells are the first responders to any pathogen, but are only 10% of your total immune cells.</p>
<p>When an NK cell kills a pathogen, it breaks it into pieces and uses the pieces to create antigens.</p>
<p>The antigens are then used by other cells to create antibodies.</p>
<p>The antibodies allow non-NK cells to identify invaders.</p>
<p>When a non-NK cell destroys an invader marked by an antibody, it in turn presents antigens to create more antibodies. <em>This is the cascade that results in a large number of antibodies being created in response to a virus.</em></p>
<p>So if a viral infection is minor enough that NK cells destroy most of it, then your body doesn't produce a lot of antibodies. A test for antibodies in your system has a sensitivity; so if there are antibodies present in very small numbers, the antibody test may not see them and indicates no antibodies at all.</p>
<p><strong>Your body also has ways of killing viruses without use of the immune cells.</strong> Mucus membranes, mild fever, and localized inflammation kill viruses and can be mild enough (at early stages) that the person doesn't realize it is happening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well the virus could have been cleared with a cytotoxic T cell response. That requires no antibodies. However to get a viral infection and develop no antibodies is a bit odd unless the infection is cleared with a CTL response before one developed or maybe they had trouble presenting antigen due to genetic factors or T cell receptor availability. </p>
<p>If this occurrence is real and not an error of some kind could be a cool thing to study.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey.  Part of it is one's immune system.  I have to take medicine that suppresses mine, which means that some years I dont develop <em>enough</em> antibodies to fight off a particular viral infection.  Even before all of this I was getting revaxinated vs the flu out of pocket to make sure I'd be ok.  We also had to do this with other booster vaccines (Hep C and such).</p>
<p>Another reason could be dose.  Direct or sustained exposure to a lot of the virus is more likely to overwhelm your system.  This makes you more likely to be sick, but your immune system goes bonkers and does everything it can to keep you from getting sick again.</p>
<p>This virus in particular is extremely complicated.  Scientists need time to figure out exactly how the antibody process works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
