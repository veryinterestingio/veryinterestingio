		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, at least some of them.</p>
<p>Darkness is not the only thing that changes on a 24-hour cycle. Close to the surface (up to 1 m depth), temperature also fluctuates on the same cycle. So worms <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/113/48/E7837" target="_blank">definitely</a> have a circadian rythm.</p>
<p>Subterranean animals such as mole rats that live deeper than that also exhibit circadian rythms.</p>
<p>As for deep see creatures, some seem to exhibit bicircadian rythm based on the lunar cycle, and others a circadian rythm based on the patterns of their prey.</p>
<p>As caves are the most arrythmic environments on the planet, cave animals exhibit the least circadian patterns of all, but some vestiges seem to be there.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5090016/" target="_blank">Here is a good survey.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe they do; as they would have most likely been surface dwellers/live in  sunlight at some point during their evolutionary history. The gene-controlled biological rhythms seem to be conserved at least in cave species, although they may have evolved to work independently of earths light-dark cycles.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not mentioned yet and I'm on mobile and can't find the reference, but I believe NASA ran a study on rhythms a decade or two ago in isolation and determined that humans eventually fall into a 25hour cycle. The interesting bit here being that our optimal day would have an additional hour in it.</p>
<p>To address your actual question, it would make sense that most organisms have an adapted circadian rhythm and a biological one based on that study alone. I wouldn't be surprised if there's plenty of evidence for it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's important to note that light is not the cause of the circadian rhythm, just a way to adjust it. The circadian rhythm is controlled by a protein and it gets feedback from various sensory systems to adjust the the time cycle. The time cycle set by the rhythm varies between animals, in humans it's about 26 hours naturally, but it recieves input from our sensory systems. For instance, there are specialized photoreceptors in our eyes that feedforward directly to the part of our brain that controls the circadian rhythm. As far as neuroscientists know, every living thing has some sort of &quot;sleep&quot; cycle independent of specific sensory inputs, regulated by a protein.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do parasites count? Some species of <em>Plasmodium</em>, which causes malaria, have a circadian rhythm. <em>P. knowlesi</em> has a 24-hour cycle although the most lethal version (<em>P. falciparum</em>) has a 48-hour cycle, and <em>P. malariae</em> has a 72-hour cycle.</p>
<p>These live in the blood, so obviously it's complete darkness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
