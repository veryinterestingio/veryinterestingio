		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no, and my answer is assuming we're talking about totally normal digestion with no food poisoning or allergies/intolerance involved.</p>
<p>Yes, we generally defecate things in the order they went in, but it's not like they are different cars on a freeway. So, while the meal you ate for lunch will generally stay ahead of the meal you ate for dinner, they will end up adjacent with some mixing at the margins. And they could easily come out in the same voiding (number of meals does not predict number of voids). Also, things eaten while previous food is still in your stomach will get pretty mixed together, and the farther apart they are, the less mixed they will be.</p>
<p>No to your bread question. <strong>Digestion times are highly variable based on the individual and foods consumed</strong>, but, in general, digestion takes 2-3 days from end to end, with most of that time spent in the large intestine where things in one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haustrum_(anatomy)" target="_blank">haustra</a> are basically locked into being ahead of anything that hits the large intestine later. So your next void would have food from the previous 2 days, and the bread won't come out for another 2-3 (edit to add: <em>or 1 or 4 or anywhere in between, depending on your digestion timing, what you eat just before and just after that bread, your hydration status, stress, etc.</em>)</p>
<p>Also fun fact, you can keep pooping even if you're fasting for days because the bacteria in your colon can stay alive from breaking down the dead cells of your mouth/stomach/intestines that are sloughed off constantly.</p>
<p>Edited to emphasize that there is a lot of individual variability so people stop commenting about their personal poop time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 2 spots in the GI tract that act as &quot;checkpoints&quot; for size: one at the bottom of your stomach before it enters your small intestines (called the pyloric sphincter, sphincter says what?), and another at the end of your small intestines before it enters the large intestines (called the iliocecal sphincter). When you eat food your body gets to work breaking it down with chewing, acids and churning/wringing by the stomach all with the goal of getting it through that 1st checkpoint, the pyloric sphincter. To pass through here food has to be ~2mm or less. If it can't pass through, your stomach just keeps grinding it up until it gets small enough to pass through.</p>
<p>However, if for some reason it cannot get broken down, about 2 hours after your last meal your body will slow down the stomach grinding and turn on the &quot;Migrating Myoelectric Complex&quot;. This bad boy causes the entire first half of your digestive system to contract super hard in a wave movement that pushes EVERYTHING (even the stuff that was too big to pass through that first checkpoint) from the top of the stomach down into the large intestine and past that second checkpoint (the ileocecal sphincter). Then the ileocecal sphincter will shut so that nothing can go back through. This happens about every 75-90 min until your next meal. This is what we commonly call having your stomach &quot;gurgle&quot;. (It is interesting that we often associate this with hunger, when actually it has nothing to do with being hungry).</p>
<p>Once it is in the large intestine (also known as the colon), it mostly is stored there until you are ready to poop it out. </p>
<p>So, short answer is no. You will usually poop everything out in the order of meals but not necessarily in the exact order you ate it. If it cannot get through that first checkpoint (the pyloric sphincter) within the first 2 hours, it will later be pushed through by the migrating myoelectric complex, regardless of its size.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>My first thought seeing it was, &quot;Of course we do,&quot; followed inmediately by, &quot;But I don't KNOW that for a fact, and there's no reason that <em>I</em> know of that it would <em>have</em> to...  Damn it!  Now I also want to find this out!&quot;</p>
