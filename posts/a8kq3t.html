		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The word for mother in many languages is some derivation of a “ma” sound. And not just those with the same root language: </p>
<p>Mandarin: mãma<br />
Hindi: māṃ<br />
Arabic: māma<br />
Navajo: amá<br />
Swahili: mama<br />
Polish: mama<br />
Aramaic: imma  </p>
<p>The theory is that “ahh” is an easy sound for babies to make, unlike those that need a tongue against teeth. Just keep your lips together for a moment too long — like if you’re nursing — and it comes out mmm-ahh. </p>
<p>So maybe it’s not gibberish trying to sound like language, it’s language coming from gibberish! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First language acquisition undergoes more or less set stages.</p>
<p>First, in pre-language:</p>
<p>Babbling </p>
<p>1 – (0 to 1 month) Children make sounds without crying</p>
<p>2 – (1 to 4 months) Children use tongue and jaw to form more complex sounds</p>
<p>3 – (3 to 8 months) Squeal, yell, whisper</p>
<p>4 – (5 to 10 months) “talking”, forming syllables</p>
<p>5 – (9 to 18 months) “sophisticated” babbling</p>
<p>Even deaf children babble, and deaf children exposed to sign language babble in sign</p>
<p>The order of frequency of learning/making babbling sounds corresponds roughly to the popularity of those sounds in most languages:</p>
<p>/b/  /p/</p>
<p>/t/  /d/  /m/</p>
<p>/k/  /g/</p>
<p>/s/</p>
<p>/h/</p>
<p>/wh/</p>
<p>/f/  /v/ Infrequent and rare in languages</p>
<p>Interdentals (th) are least frequent and last to be learned</p>
<p>The learning stages can roughly be divided into:</p>
<p>6-12 months, babbling</p>
<p>12+ word formation</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>1 - I know this isn't real IPA, calm down pedants, it's for a simplified explanation.</p>
<p>2 - bell-shaped curves exist in everything, fucking everything, and if your child played piano and skateboard while yodelling at 6 months old, it doesn't mean the guidelines are wrong for the majority of the population, calm down.</p>
<p>3 - people are crazy fascinated by the fact that deaf kids babble in sign. check out some videos on youtube, it's really cute example courtesy of u/j-steve-    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEcvlubm1es" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEcvlubm1es</a>  ). Also, there's a deaf (I think he's deaf himself) professor who is teaching/researching ways on teaching rhyming songs to kids using sign. It's pretty cool, but I don't remember his name right now, (edit this guy: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/awti" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/user/awti</a>), I specifically remember him doing &quot;hey diddle diddle the cat and the fiddle&quot; . Also, maybe some deaf person wants to start an AMA about being deaf, because people really do seem amazed.
edit edit edit u/coldcurru    tells me that:</p>
<p>Sorry if this has been said already, but I don't want to read all the replies in this comment thread. The sign language professor you talked about isn't deaf. He's CODA which means Child Of a Deaf Adult. I've watched some of his other videos. I think both of his parents are deaf. Basically he's fluent in ASL because he grew up with it having deaf parents. </p>
<p>4 - if you really feel the need to point out how insanely wrong I am, the book most of this information comes from is called &quot;An Introduction to Languages&quot; by Fromkin, Rodman and Hyams, give them a call and argue with them since obviously you know more than they do.</p>
<p>5 - a lot of people have speech pathology/therapy questions, especially about their kids, but that's not my thing, so maybe a AMA from someone like that would be appreciated, just a suggestion
edit : u/tartankaboosemoose says: Am an SLT. Can confirm this is correct- not that it needs it. If anyone has SLT questions I can try help or direct you to r/SLP</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both. All kids develop differently both physically and mentally. Some gibberish is the child truly talking but still not able to form the words or thoughts correctly. Sometimes gibberish is purely exploring the noises they can make because it is fun. I’m mean, they are learning a language and figuring out how their bodies work.  I’ve noticed with mine (who started talking early), every time she is making big developments mentally, her speech gets a little jumbled as she’s trying to learn how to use words in a more abstract way. When she was 1.5 years old, I was putting her to bed she said, “I’m bored. I have nothing to do...” she sounded like an 8 year old. Next day she was running around screaming like a normal 1 year old.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
