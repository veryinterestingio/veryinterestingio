		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are dice out there that are engineered specifically to avoid this issue. They're typically casino dice, but the pips (the dots or dimples on dice) on casino dice are filled with a different color to keep them balanced. </p>
<p>The general consensus on this issue is that imperfectly weighted dice are <em>random enough</em> for most purposes. Meaning that unless you measure each individual die and test it enough to determine which number it will land on the most, it doesn't matter. Most people don't use dice for anything remotely serious, so the general outcome of the rolls isn't that important.</p>
<p>Edit: I get it, we all take board games seriously, but when I say important, I mean that most people don't have thousands of dollars riding on their dice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With a typical six sided die, the fact is that they are not engineered and manufactured to be perfectly fair - they are made to be 'fair enough' for use playing things like board games that require some level of randomness, but ultimately are not too strict.</p>
<p>As a thought, if your die has perhaps a 5% bias to a particular face, even if you roll it 100 times over the course of a game, you will never pick up on that bias when on the confines of a game and all of the other variables that brings to hide it.</p>
<p>The one place where this statistic can make a difference is in the big money gambling, which is why unlike generic board game dice, casino grade dice are made to a vastly higher tolerance to ensure fairness, to note some of the main rules:
They must be exact cubes, manufactured to a tolerance of a thousandth of an inch. This is why they are all have sharp edges to ensure this and show any tampering
To create the pips, the material removed to form the pip is refilled with an opaque version of the same material to ensure no change in the weight distribution (which answers the initial question here).
The pips must also be drilled and filled rather than painted, to ensure the paint cannot be worn off or altered during play.
The dice must be partially translucent, so that you can visually check for things like air bubbles or weights they would influence a roll.
The dice are all produced in sets of five, which are all given matching serial numbers - so the dealer knows the set of dice in play and they cannot be substituted.</p>
<p>Lots of rules that make sense when gambling for high stakes, but if all I am doing is playing a board game with friends or determining my characters stats in D&amp;D, then the tolerances won't really influence everything enough to make any meaningful difference (though that will never stop posters believing they have 'lucky dice').</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simple fact is that, if we are talking about cheap dice (non-casino dice, or anything that costs you 1-digit prices), then the dices are NOT unweighted at all, far from it.   </p>
<hr />
<p>This study : <a href="https://www.dakkadakka.com/wiki/en/That's_How_I_Roll_-_A_Scientific_Analysis_of_Dice" target="_blank">https://www.dakkadakka.com/wiki/en/That's_How_I_Roll_-_A_Scientific_Analysis_of_Dice</a>
Rolled dice 144,000 times.  The results are as follows :  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Casino Dice :  16.7% 1's</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cheapish dice (Squared edges) :  19% 1's</p>
</li>
<li>Cheap Chessex Dice (rounded edges) :   29% 1's</li>
</ul>
<p>Keeping in mind that any number should have a 16.7% chance of being rolled, we can see that cheap dice are simply not random at all, but heavily weighted to rolling ones.  </p>
<hr />
<p>If we are going to talk about cheap dice, then what you are asking is hardly even a valid question.    Cheap dice are just composite, and the composite used often has little (or none usually) Quality Control.  The weight of the composite is often inconsistent, leading to some dice weighing more, or worse yet, some SIDES of one dice being heavier than the other side of the same dice.  </p>
<p>Not to mention AIR pockets!   Check out the Reddit article here for a picture of a die with a huge air pocket.  It was cut open because it rolled inconsistently, and voila!  air bubbles.   </p>

<p>This article probably covers many of people's questions</p>

<p>Also, a lot of us who frequent game conventions know Lou, the crotchety old dice guy.  He's always willing to talk to you, even when you don't have time :)   He's a seasoned source, and his lecture here : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRzg_M8pQms" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRzg_M8pQms</a> covers a LOT of the issues with dice, most of which stem from the manufacturing process</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For my 8th grade science fair project, I rolled casino dice (no indents) 300 times and monopoly dice 300 times. Started to notice a difference around 100 rolls. Decent number more 5s and 6s for the monopoly dice then for the Casino dice. Kid next to me at the county level had done some crazy thing involving Fibonacci numbers in nature and used code. She was not happy that I beat her rolling dice over and over.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people have answered this question generally (i.e., most dice you buy that aren't casino dice aren't fair). But, they haven't talked whether the cause is actually the pips. There's one cool study out there that actually suggests it's not the carved out pips that causes the unfairness, but rather, uneven faces. Zachariah Labby threw a set of 12 dice 26,306 times and found that 1's and 6's were more common.</p>
<p>This is important because the opposite sides of dice always add up to 7. If it were the pips, then the 1 and 2 side would be heavier, and thus more likely to land face down (meaning that 5's and 6's would be rolled on the dice more frequently). When he measured the dice he used, he found that the 1-6 axis of the dice had smaller faces. Thus, they were less likely to land face down, which increases the chance of getting a 1 or 6 on the dice. </p>
<p>So, dice are unfair but it might be because they aren't perfect cubes rather than the hollowed out pips. Of course, this is only 12 dice so it's always possible that the pips make a difference sometimes too (i.e., if by chance, the dice was close to a perfect cube)! Each dice varies slightly from others due to various imperfections, so not all dice are necessarily biased in quite the same way. </p>
