		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was looking through the adverse reactions to the COVID vaccines, and I found it interesting that the CDC report that younger people are more likely to experience (or at the very least report) an adverse reaction to the COVID vaccines than if you were older. I would have thought it would be the opposite (due to older people having weaker immune systems)? Can someone explain this phenomenon? Is this something of all vaccines? What's the biological mechanism here?</p>
<p>Refer to table 1 of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7008e3.htm" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7008e3.htm" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7008e3.htm</a></a>: 64.9% of 18 to 49 report an adverse reaction. I thought perhaps it was to do with unequal category sizes (18 to 49, versus say 50 to 64), but I don't think it is as this represents 2/3 of the total.</p>
<p>P.S. I really don't want to get into a debate about whether or not people should take the vaccine or not (I think people at risk, definitely should). I simply want to understand why vaccines effect different age groups in different ways.</p>
<p>(For some reason moderators removed this post... This is a legitimate medicinal question, but for some reason I'm not even allowed to ask it)</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that the data that you're looking at is collected by VAERS, which is a voluntary self-reporting online tool.  Looking at this table, you can see that 64.9% of people who reported an adverse reaction to VAERS are ages 18 to 49.  The survey pool here is limited to those who reported, it's not indicative of everyone that received a vaccine.</p>
<p>Naturally, the data is going to be biased toward those that actually go through the effort of going online and reporting, which, statistically speaking, is going to be a younger crowd.  Additionally, this is data that was collected as of January 13th, which is long before any state opened up vaccines to the general population for people under 65 years of age.  The younger respondents on this survey are most likely those working in the healthcare industry (who had early access to the vaccines), who would have a greater awareness of the VAERS tool.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Extremely rare and serious adverse reactions aside, most &quot;side effects&quot; from a vaccine are generally just due to your own immune response. </p>
<p>It's a well established fact that with almost all vaccines, older people will have a less severe reaction, because they have a weaker immune system. Which also means they will have less effective protection.</p>
<p>So gettings some side effects from a vaccine, such as feeling slightly sick for a day or two, is actually a good sign. It means it's working.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>No. It says that 64.9% of the reports of adverse reactions were 18-49 which is very, very different.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The population who received the vaccine prior to January 13 (which this study covers) were not a random population sample, so I'd hesitate to compare age groups. For instance, very few people under the age of 18 (~22.7% of the population) would have been vaccinated.</p>
<p>In addition, 90% of the adverse effects were non-serious, so it could simply be that the elderly were more likely to have say, chronic headaches or fatigue and neither they nor their care workers, reported it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>VAERS is full of biases, so the kind of analysis your are doing with it really isn't possible, it's just not representative.</p>
<p>However, the same pattern was also seen in the controlled studies, but I think you have the logic backwards. The vaccines themselves are basically inert (as opposed to some vaccines that contain live, although attenuated, virus), so all side-effects are caused by the immune system itself. This means that older people, with a weaker immune system, will also experience weaker side-effects. This doesn't necessarily apply to young children, since the &quot;strength&quot; of your immune system ist not just a transitive number, and here the important part of the &quot;strength&quot; is its tendency to overreact to stimuli. But in general, older people will experience less side-effects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
