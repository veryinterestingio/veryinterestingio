<p>It doesn't matter if the product kills 100 trees if released into the wilderness, as long as it doesn't make you ill, it's &quot;safe&quot;</p>
<p>Flushable wipes arn't &quot;safe&quot; to flush, they are safe to use. meaning using them to wipe your self won't cause illness or harm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
