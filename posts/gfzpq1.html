		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but eating <em>some</em> bacteria isn't what hurts you.  Your stomach handles bacteria every day, surfaces are covered with them.  However, when bacteria and fungi have been growing for a while on food, they've eaten some of it and, well, pooped.  The toxins they release after they eat are designed to kill things, like other microbes looking to &quot;share&quot; the food that the current diners have found.  </p>
<p>Penicillin is the poop of the Penicillium chrysogenum <del>bacteria</del> fungus, released to keep others from sharing the bread P.C. is living on.  (Fun bonus fact, a relatives Penicillium roqueforti and Penicillium camemberti are used because we like the flavor their poop gives cheese.)</p>
<p>Enough microwaves to destroy these toxin molecules would virtually incinerate your food.</p>
<p>Edit: microbe type, oops</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When food spoils it usually means that mold and bacteria have started to grow on it. While you can kill these if you apply enough heat for enough time, this won't destroy the toxins they have produced, and those can still make you ill. In addition, microwaves work over a short time and heat up food unevenly, so there can easily be patches where bacteria survived.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're quite right about bacteria and fungi effectively being water wrapped up in a balloon (a cell membrane)! The application of heat (by microwaving or other heat like ovens) basically shakes apart the cell membrane, resulting in the cell ripping apart- think like how an earthquake shatters a buildings walls down.</p>
<p>This isn't the be all and end all. The bacteria and fungi were able to exist and divide massively in your food because, well, it's a food source! As time went by on the foods expiry date, the fungi/bacteria were able to rapidly divide and exponentially multiply. While they were doing this they were making various proteins to break down the food that they pumped outside of themselves and soaked all around the food.</p>
<p>These proteins are more temperature stable than living cells, and last on even after intense heating like cooking. These proteins are often toxins and are hazardous to you, me and many other animals that leave food alone for a bit too long. Evolution for us has prepared us for this by being able to detect rancid food and be scared off by it- hence why you often know something is off just by smelling it!</p>
<p>Hope this helps answer your question</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Food scientist here. You are partially correct. But microwaving doesn't make a food safe for two reasons. There are two different types of foodborne illness, infections and poisoning.</p>
<p>Listeria and salmonella are two examoles of infections. They are able to get through your stomach and into your intestines, and from there to other areas of the body where the cells themselves grow and divide.</p>
<p>Botulism is a type of food poisoning caused by the toxin produced by clostridium botulinum. This is literally the same toxin used in Botox.</p>
<p>The first reason microwaving won't make a bad food safe that, while most of the infectious cells will burst and die, there are some that will make it through. Even in industrial processes, there isn't ever a guarantee that all the cells get burst. The odds are very slim, but there is always a chance a mutated or super resistant cell will survive to cause problems</p>
<p>The second reason is that the toxins bacteria produce are extremely heat stable. Industrial canning processes, which hold food at 250°F for 30+ minutes, isn't able to destroy the toxins. There is no way a home microwave could ever achieve that kind of temperature throughout a food product.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
