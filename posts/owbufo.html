<p>In some exchanges it’s the closing auction price
In some it is VWAP of last certain minutes (like 30 minutes in India ) </p>
<p>Last traded price is just the last traded print, it may or may not be equal to the closing price . </p>
<p>In Korea HK Taiwan it is same
In india it’s different</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you look at trading, you typically like to block it up into time periods. This originated from from traditional stock trading, where the trading occurred during working hours. Trading started in the morning and ended in the evening, making an open and close of the stock market. So the market was frequently viewed in blocks of 1 day time periods and comparing the &quot;open&quot; price at the beginning of each day, to the &quot;closing&quot; price at the end of each day, gave a consistent point of reference for comparison. </p>
<p>Now days, people can frequently trade 24 hours a day, yet viewing the stock history in chunks of time periods is still helpful. While we are still likely to look at it in 1 day time periods, we might also look at it in 30 minute and even minute time periods. In the latter case, we'd be comparing the open value at the start of each minute, to the close value at the end of each minute. </p>
<p>We can usually pick the time period we want on interactive charts, so it is beneficial to look at the trends in multiple time periods. A nice long view, then a closer, and closer view with smaller timer periods, gives insights from multiple perspectives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Often the price at a given moment is the midpoint between the bid (how much traders are looking to buy for) and the ask (how much traders are willing to sell for). The closing price can be given as the midpoint of this spread for open buy/sell orders at the close. This spread is often wider for less traded equities and for periods before open and after close.</p>
<p>The last traded price would be the price of the last actually completed trade of the day, likely very close to the bid/ask midpoint, but not necessarily exactly the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what instrument you are looking at and how. Former technical analyst here,  a lot of charting software show the settlement price of a future as the closing price (or at least used to).  Settlement price typically being an average of the traded price around a specific time say 4:00pm while trading continued until 9:00pm</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
