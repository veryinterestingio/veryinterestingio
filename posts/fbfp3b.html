		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Happy Leap Day!</strong> We hope you're jumping for joy on February 29. To celebrate, we'd like to open up a <strong>Frog Megathread</strong>. Our biologists will be on hand to answer your questions!</p>
<p><a href="https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Anura/" target="_blank"><strong>Anura</strong></a> is the largest extant (i.e. not extinct) order of amphibians, with over 6,300 documented species. There are a few things that set frogs apart: </p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Anura&quot; means &quot;without a tail&quot; - a reference to the loss of their tails as adults. </li>
<li>One of the most unique features is called a <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums-static/obl4he/vertebratediversity/frogs_and_toads.html" target="_blank">urostyle</a>, and it's formed by fused sacral vertebrae. </li>
<li>They lack ribs, and have relatively few presacral vertebrae (fewer than 9, usually 8). </li>
<li>They also fuse some limb bones together: the radius and ulna in the arm fuse into the radio-ulna, and the tibia and fibula fuse into the tibiofibula.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can't talk about frogs without mentioning that amphibians are experiencing a global decline, and are going extinct <a href="https://www.herpconbio.org/~herpconb/McCallum/amphibian%20extinctions.pdf" target="_blank">much more quickly than background extinction rates</a> (PDF). There are a number of causes at play. </p>
<p>One is known as <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/03/bd-frogs-apocalypse-disease/585862/" target="_blank"><strong>amphibian chytrid fungus</strong></a>. This fungus has caused the extinction of more species than any other pathogen. It has caused the decline of 501 amphibian species, caused a further 124 to drop by 90% or more, and caused the extinction of 90.</p>
<p><a href="https://journals.openedition.org/sapiens/1406" target="_blank">Additional factors in amphibian decline</a> include habitat change (destruction or loss), affecting as many as 63% of amphibian species; invasive species including fish or even other amphibian species; environmental toxins like pesticides; and global climate change. </p>
<p>Today we'd like to celebrate our froggy friends, call attention to the importance of their conservation, and answer any questions you may have. Please join us on our Leap Day Frog Megathread!</p></div></div>

It is insane to me that a single fungus strain is viable in such a wide range of places and just decimating frogs.
