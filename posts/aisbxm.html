		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nerves signals are the culprit you're looking for.  </p>
<p>Sometimes, when your brain is perceiving things, it can get over-stimulated and overreact.  Your brain starts firing out warning signals out of confussion and BAM!  Headache.  We think this is why silly things like sunlight and sudden changes in noise/temp/sugar levels/blood pressure/whatever, can cause some people headaches. They disrupt our brain's regular activity so much that it gets out-of-whack.  Pain is important, as it lets us know something is wrong.  Unfortunately with headaches, when something goes wrong in our brains, it reallllly sucks.  Seizures, strokes, migraines, lack of oxygen leading to permanent damage- brain injuries suck.  We know what can cause them, and how neurons respond, but, we still don't know <em>why</em> some happen, seemingly for no reason.<br />

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><del>IIRC its when too much blood is in a certain area of the brain. It kinda swells it if that makes sense. Correct me if im wrong (probably), im hoping to be a neuroscientist someday so anything about brain interests me.</del> </p>
<p>Correction, a headache is when our nervous system is a little too sensitive, some main triggers are loud noise, smells, and light. Genetics can also play a role in how we respond to certain stimuli. </p>
<p>Edit: here is a video i found to be helpful: <a href="https://youtu.be/RJeqcikMKAI" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/RJeqcikMKAI</a></p>
<p>Also, sorry i was answering the question by u/givemheckkid</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many things that can cause a headache. Many of those causes involve the tissue in the face, scalp, and neck. The tissue in those areas is thin. The tissue in those areas is also important and reactive. As a result, the tissue in those areas requires more blood than other areas. As a result, the tissue in those areas, while thin, is dense with capillaries. </p>
<p>When you hear a loud noise, your blood pressure increases. A surprising loud noise can cause a spike, but even a constant known loud noise will elevate blood pressure.</p>
<p>Because the tissue of the face, scalp, and neck is thin, there is not much room for expansion to accommodate the increased pressure. Because the tissue is dense with capillaries, the effect of pressure is more noticeable.</p>
<p>Those factors can combine to cause a headache.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
