		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR: they can’t.  </p>
<p>Your body exists kind of in a bell curve.  Too little exercise = your joints degrade.   Too much = your joints wear out.  The athletes you watched are in the top end of that bell curve.  They have a limited window before they have to stop, because their bodies can’t do that forever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of these things. They definitely suffer deterioration and injury. And whereas you or I might tweak a knee and lay up for a week or three, they play through the pain or are given a ton of pain medication to play. (In addition to top-of-the line therapies, no doubt. Sports medicine has some miracles when it comes to a million-dollar athlete that simply aren't considered when Regular Joe tears a meniscus. But pushing your body through pain might still a part of it, whether it's accelerating through rehab or putting off the surgery to finish the season.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They absolutely do take damage over time. Even people who just played certain sports in high school/college often have lasting effects, ranging from mild to debilitating. Many pro athletes' careers end due to injuries or gradual damage - and that's <em>with</em> access to the best trainers and physical therapists.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a month out of turning 55. I played football from 3rd-12th grade. I was a street skateboarder through my mid-30s, switched to street BMX into my 40s and finally switched over to only surfing from 42 to now. I'm still standing, but my knees have little-to-no cartilage left, my hips are all whack, and have recurring issues with bulging discs.</p>
<p>The top comment is correct, even for those of us who are not top athletes. Bodies operate the same. Too little? You deteriorate. Too much? You rapidly deteriorate. The latter is much more fun...trust me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
