S2 is a star in close orbit around the (likely) supermassive blackhole at the center of our galaxy. It was recorded moving 2.7% the speed of light at its closest approach.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what you mean by &quot;objects&quot;.  Photons move (somewhat by definition) at 100% of the speed of light, of course.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graviton" target="_blank">Gravitons</a> are only theorized, but would be expected to also move at 100% the speed of light - at any rate, gravity propagates at the speed of light.  These are massless particles, though, which might be less interesting.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurements_of_neutrino_speed" target="_blank">Neutrinos</a> have mass, so we know they can't move at the speed of light, but the amount below the speed of light at which they move is smaller than our margin of measurement error, so we don't actually know how fast they go.  We do know it is at least 99.9999999% of the speed of light (that's a deviation of 10^-9 , if you're looking for where that number came from on the Wikipedia page).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there have been high energy interstellar particles detected on earth that would have been travelling very close to the speed of light. I think the first one discovered was called the OMG particle from memory and was calculated to be moving at 99.99999999999% the speed of light. Also our particle accelerators get close. Take off a few 9's after the decimal but the LHC gets protons to something like 99.999% LS</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
