		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I often wonder about this. Like if there's a news clip about someone being charged for child pornography they'll often do a shot of a blurred out monitor with what look to be naked bodies on it. Like how are they allowed to film that monitor? They must have unblurred footage of it. Unless the police makes the clip and blur it out before they hand it to the journalist.</p>

<p>EDIT: Sorry about the slight change of subject. I didn't see the word &quot;drug&quot; in there at first, so I thought you were simply asking about any documentary involving illegal activities.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In most jurisdictions, generally speaking you don't have to report a crime. E.g., if you passed by a junkie on the sidewalk doing drugs, you wouldn't <em>have</em> to report it to the police (I'm guessing almost everyone would just keep on walking). There are some exceptions to that (mandated reporters) but they typically don't involve drug use.</p>
<p>When the documentary is released, the police could choose to open an investigation based on what they saw. If things were really serious, theoretically they could subpoena the documentary-maker the provide them with names or raw video footage or testimony or whatever.</p>
<p>It would be a big hassle and I'm guessing most police departments wouldn't really give a shit if some random person did drugs in a documentary, unless there were more serious crimes involved.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
