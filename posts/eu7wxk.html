		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Under normal conditions, there's these control centers in your brain that tell your eye muscles to move at the same time. Your brain has to receive the same image from both eyes so that it can paint the world around you. If the left eye is looking to the left and the right eye is looking to the right, then the images don't match up and it makes you feel sick.</p>
<p>Longer, not ELI5:
Light enters your eyes and the information goes to the optic nerve, optic chiasm, and ultimately to the primary visual cortex in the occipital lobe (back of your head). Information is processed here and the output is sent to the muscles that control the eyes via cranial nerves (CN) 3, 4, and 6. CN 3 controls basically every eye muscle except for the superior oblique (CN 4) and the lateral rectus (CN 6). However, before the information from the primary visual cortex can be transmitted to the eye muscles, it has to go through certain control centers. One of which is the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF). The MLF is responsible for conjugate horizontal gaze which means it makes sure that the muscles for looking left and right contract at the same time so that your eyes are moving in sync. It does this by sending information to CN 3 (responsible for medial rectus) and CN 6 (responsible for lateral rectus). There's another area called the rostral interstitial nucleus that is responsible for conjugate vertical gaze, which is for looking up and down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some species have binocular vision, meaning two eyes pointed the same direction, and this gives them depth perception. You need two images to form a 3D picture. Predators tend to have this so they can target prey accurately.</p>
<p>Meanwhile prey animals frequently have eyes on opposite sides of their head (which cannot physically look at the same object at the same time). For these animals, it’s more important to be able to look all around for danger so they can flee rapidly. Seeing the danger with great precision isn’t that important because the result will still be the same: they’ll just run away as fast as they can.</p>
<p>Whichever system an animal’s eyes are set up for, its brain is also set up for. Brain matter is expensive in terms of maintenance calories and animals tend to have as much as they need and no more. There doesn’t seem to be an animal that got SO much use out of switching between binocular/dual monocular that it was worth the cost of the added brain structures. Either that or it just wasn’t useful enough that environment and natural selection drove any species toward it at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This has to do with depth perception. We are hunters, so we need to know how far the prey is while we are running trying not to trip and throwing a spear. That all needs depth perception and balance which your two eyes give your brain. Try doing that with one eye closed and see how badly you fail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
