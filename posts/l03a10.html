		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trademarks are only valid for the line of business it is actually for. For example using five rings to promote your sporting event is a big no-no because it resembled the olypmic rings. However using five rings to promote your line of sports drinks is fine, assuming nobody have registered a similar trademark to promote their line of sports drinks. This means that the patent office does not have to look through all logos to find similar ones but can limit themselves to one section. In addition any logos that is submited for trademarking requires a text description. This can be used to look up an index over already trademarked logos. In addition a granted trademark may be appealed if it can be shown to have been erroniously issued. So even if the patent office misses the similarities between two trademarked logos this may be resolved once these similarities are discovered later on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The trademark examiner has access to specialized software that can match word marks and design marks to the trademark database. For example, you can search design marks with <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/search/design-search-codes" target="_blank">special codes</a>, text descriptions, or image-matching software somewhat like Google reverse image search. Before they had computers to help, they used the design codes to manually find similar marks in the trademark database.  IANAL.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't. This type of thing only comes up when somebody (like the company that already has a logo just like that) complains about it, at that point they have two claims to a design and will solve it appropriately.</p>
<p>Same goes for patents, there are over a hundred patents by different people and companies for the basic incandescent light bulb for example. Of course none of them are actually useful as they'd have to challenge the oldest patent on the record and they'd lose in court. Still, sometimes this is used as a tactic for patent trolling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trademarks are only valid while they’re being used in commerce. Most trademarks have fallen into disuse (or “abandonment”).</p>
<p>And most trademarks are not registered with the USPTO.</p>
<p>So those who work in trademark registration don’t have to search very long to see all the possible infringers in a particular category.</p>
<p>And once a mark is accepted for registration, it gets “published” in a specific place where all the competitors can see it. They can challenge the registration before it becomes official, saying it infringes on their existing registered mark.</p>
<p>The trademark office does a little work, and the private lawyers do the rest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
