		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Their rocket and space ship were only designed to just get into space but not stay in space. In order to stay in an orbit, a space ship has to accelerate to 22,000 mph (or around there). This requires a massive amount of fuel. Neither of these ships were designed for this. They just carried enough fuel to get into space and once there, they immediately begin to fall back to earth. Neither of the ships will ever be more than a really expensive roller coaster ride.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, their companies are nowhere near being technically advanced in spaceflight to achieve this.</p>
<p>Blue origin have never sent anything to orbit. In 4 years, they have only built 9 BE4 engines, which is a laughable production capacity. Essentially, blue origin are almost like a mickey mouse competitor in the commercial space industry. They have huge funding and talk a big game, but when it comes to implementation, they are truly shocking and slow. The fact bezos just offered Nasa 2 billion for him to supply them a lunar lander they previously said was too expensive is just peak blue origin. </p>
<p>Virgin are slightly ahead of blue origin. They have gotten small sat launchers into orbit, and they have a unique method of doing so using a smaller expendable rocket. This largely puts them in the saame bracket as RocketLab, how can also send things to orbit in a somewhat reusbale/low cost method, but their hardware simply isn't ever going to send large payloads in its current form. In terms of human orbital capabilites, virgin are a huge way off. The space plane they use has essentially no chance ever of achieving orbital velocity, so they would have to have a complete rethink to move to orbital tourism.</p>
<p>SpaceX, who are far and away the leader of commercial space, have heavy lift orbital capabilites all ready. In a few months spacex will be sending the first orbital capsule in space that contains only private citizens, and will mark a significant milestone in space tourism that quite frankly other companies are kot even close to achieving. They simply do not have the research and dhardware to do so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1: the ships they went in were not made with the idea of staying up there only to reach &quot;space&quot; and make it back safely(only about 100km up) for actual orbit you need to reach much higher speeds and be built at a much higher standard, this is what makes their trip a lot less impressive than what it actually is(it was effectively just a very high altitude flight), but neither of them will admit this since this would be admitting they aren't capable  of orbit yet.</p>
<p>2:Neither of them is actually properly trained for a prolonged stay in space, in fact both of them were classed as &quot;cargo&quot; and would likely spend the whole trip passed out if they actually did the procedures ot enter orbit and re-entry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What they did was to accelerate upwards at about 2km/s which gave them quite a long freefall. But unlike real spaceflight they did not manage the achievement of missing the ground in their freefall so eventually they had to use their parachute for a nice controlled descent and landing. In order to miss the ground you need to be going very fast across it, about 8km/s should do. But it is not enough to just strap five rockets together because you then need rockets to lift those rockets into space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
