<p>In ELI5 terms: we don't know.</p>
<p>Science does not have a good idea about what happens when we fall in love, or what makes us fall in love. We do know lots of details, such as a bunch of chemicals and brain structures which are involved, but we don't really have a good idea of how it all fits together.</p>
<p>It doesn't help that &quot;being in love&quot; can mean different things, is subjective and not measurable.</p>
<p>To get a good sense of the kind of progress we are making on this, here's a recent-ish article with some actual science behind it:
<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2133227-brain-switch-in-voles-makes-them-fall-in-love-at-first-sight/" target="_blank">https://www.newscientist.com/article/2133227-brain-switch-in-voles-makes-them-fall-in-love-at-first-sight/</a></p>
<p>But I wouldn't hold my breath on figuring this out, it's probably gonna be a while...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Over time you associate pleasant feelings a person makes you feel with that person, and you become more attracted to them and spend more time with them. You learn more about them and the pleasant feelings become more nuanced with more information. </p>
<p>The crux of your question is how does the brain form associations between a person and pleasant feelings. This works by altering the connections between brain cells, and depends on many chemicals and regions of the brain working together. The amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, striatum and hippocampus are relevant regions. Dopamine, glutamate, oxytocin, serotonin and GABA are relevant chemicals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question is based on a misunderstanding of love. Love is not a simple feeling like pleasure, pain, disgust, fear, sadness, surprise, etc. Love is not one of the 6+ basic emotions.</p>
<p>Love is a complicated relationship &amp; set of dispositions, attitudes, and more basic emotions. You're happy at your loved's joy as well as pained by your beloved's pain - but that's the obvious part of defining love. Here's the less obvious parts of love: You're also jealous at things you wouldn't have been jealous about before, angry &amp; hurt when your beloved neglects or betrays you unlike before, prideful of your beloved and the accomplishments of your beloved in a way that makes them and their accomplishments feel like your own... and on and on and on with many different smaller emotional aspects of the full loving attitude. </p>
<p><em>Love is a multifacited attitude and personality shift that all centers around a particular person that isn't just a single feeling but really a range of emotions and more which comes to focus on a particular person in a very specific way.</em></p>
<p>Beyond your emotional dispositions, love can (or does) also involve - as some philosophers argue - a different attitude toward your beloved than you have toward strangers. Some philosophers claim that love involves an attitude toward your beloved that includes more fully seeing your beloved as a fellow person with an equal consciousness and point of view looking out on the world just like your own. The (Kantian) idea here is that love involves more fully recognizing another human as a fellow equal conscious person which we generally don't do with strangers. Another alternative and less complicated proposal is that love involves a team-work / co-planning attitude between you and your beloeved which involves a rising above one's selfish self-interest and the taking on of a combined outlook of &quot;our&quot; good rather than just merely &quot;my&quot; good. </p>
<p>In any case, your question isn't really answerable as it's stated. What does love do to the brain? It involves a complex set of dispositions, attitudes, emotional reactions, etc. etc. all centered around a particular person. What does having this happen feel like? Well, usually we experience this broad orientation shift as a good thing - a joy even - because we are hoping for this to happen and we are happy/relieved when it does. Plus, when we fall in love, we usually like the person and so this orientation shift can feel exciting and good. But there's no reason someone couldn't be unhappy about falling in love. Maybe such a person didn't want a psychological shift like this to happen at all or not to happen toward some particular person - and so perhaps the meta-realization that they've fallen in love can bring dread rather than joy. Realizing you've fallen out of love with someone can be pleasant or painful; just as realizing you've fallen in love with someone can be pleasant or painful. But love itself isn't an emotion. Love is a complex profile of psychological traits which involves dispositions, feelings, habits of thinking, patterns of concern, patterns of attention, etc. all oriented toward a particular person. And you can experience the recognition of this orientation shift as a good thing or as a bad thing.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;What happens to our brain when we fall in love?&quot;</strong> <em>A lot of multifaceted stuff of very different sorts that can't be boiled down to a simple answer - love isn't a simple emotion like disgust or joy or pleasure or pain.</em></p>
