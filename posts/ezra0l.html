		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The hypothesis of your question feels wrong. I feel there are as many of both, and that you are just more picky to call a cold day in summer a &quot;winter day&quot; that you are to call a hot day in winter a &quot;summer day&quot;.</p>
<p>I mean, I don't know where you live. But where I live (Lyon, France), in winter it is usually 5°C (40°F), and we call it a &quot;particularly hot&quot; when it is 20°C (70°F), and in summer it is usually 30°C (85°F) and we call it &quot;particularly cold&quot; when it is 15°C (60°F). An both of them happens, and it didn't feel to me like one was more frequent than the other.</p>
<p>[Excluding global warming that makes winter of nowadays slightly hotter in average than few decades ago]</p>
<p>Even moving through France, I never had days in Winter that were like hot days in Summer. The only reason why some days feel hot is because I'm not in Summer clothing so 20°C in winter clothing feels hot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This very much depends on the climate of where you live. In Canada, where I am, winter temperatures are usually around -10C. You might get a day of +5C in winter, but you would <em>never</em> get a day that's 15-20C like you get in summer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
