		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve been doing some teaching which has required me to provide some blood so that we can demonstrate blood typing with agglutinins. </p>
<p>In order to obtain the blood I’ve been using disposable lancets like a diabetic person would use on my fingers. When I’m not in the lab I’m an avid gamer so I’ve really started to notice the small wounds on my fingers after doing this twice a day for a week. </p>
<p>I wonder whether diabetic people who have to do this regularly for life heal more quickly? Or do they just put up with it without moaning unlike myself</p>
<p>I am not particularly well versed in the mechanisms of wound healing, however I would think that regular injury of a particular tissue could lead to up regulation of genes related to these pathways within those tissues and thus faster healing?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned by several other commenters, wound healing will slow down the more often you are injured, especially if it is in the same place multiple time. This is mainly because of aging of the cells near the wound and reduced replication potential, which is necessary for healing. Depending on the tissue, depletion of the stem cells in the area may also play a factor in slower healing. </p>
<p>I also want to add that diabetics also exhibit slower wound healing as a result of diabetes, so their experience might differ slightly from those without the disease.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since you used the lancets as an example, let me share the following.   I have been diabetic for about 12 years.  I met a guy who had been diabetic for 45 years.   After that many years of making his fingers bleed, he could quite literally just squeeze any of his fingertips and blood would come out somewhere.</p>
<p>So for diabetics, the answer has historically been &quot;we just put it up with it&quot;.   </p>
<p>However, with glucose sensors becoming widely available in the past 2-3 years many of us don't have to do this anymore.    That isn't relevant to your question but thought I would offer it anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
