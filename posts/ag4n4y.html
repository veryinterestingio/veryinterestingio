Like if you put a bunch of lego pieces together it'll still be a lego conglomerate, but if you put a bunch of atoms together you get an interesting substance. Its like making a lego set from bland legoes but afterwards when the set is done it magically glows or suddently becomes liquid at room temp. Like lets say pure carbon is just pencil lead or a diamond. Then you add a bunch of hydrogens to it, which is literally just adding a few more protons and you get oily fuel. Or you get the synthetic smell of bananas. Just by adding some atoms to it.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simplest answer is that atoms themselves <em>aren't</em> so bland. Atoms on their own have different properties, and for the purposes of your question those differences are most noticeable when you stick different ones to each other.</p>
<p>Imagine each different colour of Lego brick had different properties, like how strongly they stick to other bricks or whether they're totally hard or kinda rubbery. Also imagine that they're not all the same shape of brick, some colours are the bigger bricks and some colours are the smaller bricks. Also also, imagine that some colours have room for connections on the side, not just top and bottom, and some are even all outies or all innies. The shapes you're able to make, how big they can be before they fall apart, how flexible they are, these now depend on which colours of bricks you use. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You just need to press your lego analogy a slight bit further.  </p>
<p>Technic is just shafts, gears, and some blocks.  </p>
<p>Put them together and you can get transmissions, walking robots, cars, stearing systems.  </p>
<p>Similarly, molecules can be put to work to be machines too.  One of my favorites is flagella.  </p>
<p>All of this is driven by energy gradiants, just like everything in the universe.  </p>
<p>Different shapes, have different mechanical properties, as well as being higher or lower energy shapes.  They also flex around, and can cause other molecules to flex around.  </p>
<p>For example, many explosives are just molecules with lots of nitrogen in them.  That nitrogen <em>really</em> wants to go from the high energy molecule, to its nice low energy nobel gas N2 molecule.  </p>
<p>But it cant just change from the high energy molecule, to the low energy N2.  You have to give the high energy molecule a bit more energy to get it out of its local minima, basically, change its shape enough that the nitrogen can start leaving the molecule.  In the process energy is released quickly.  </p>
<p>And atoms arent actually bland.  Start reading about electron orbits, their shapes, why theres 2 pe orbital, etc.  </p>
<p>All of that helps drive what I was talking about before.  </p>
<p>Theres even some interesting relativity mixed into atoms.  Lookup why gold is gold color and not what most metals are supposed to be, a silvery color.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>in your analogy you can imagine if you build a long enough set of legos they will begin to bend just a little, now connect enough of them and you should be able to make a ring that connects to itself, now you have something that can roll which is not a normal property of standard legos, now imagine that you have an infinite amount to work with (atoms are very tiny) and you make  bunch of these rings but they connect like chain links? now you have a rope, again yet another property that does not normally apply to a few legos, NOW obviously legos would just fall apart if connected that long but atoms don't because of interactions from electrons, now imagine you have some legos that are magnetic? well now you have even more options on what you can do with them, now imagine some legos can change one lego into another type just by being near each other and you start to get a very complex thing that at it's base form seems rather simple.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eggs, butter, sugar, flour all turn in to a cake under the right conditions.  Once it is a cake it stops resembling the other four and it is hard to imagine that one is a product of the other.  Everything is made up of other smaller things.  If you simply mix the things together you still have the individual components in the mixture but when there are chemical bonds the original ingredients are transformed in to new compounds that have all new properties.  At the end of the day it is all the laws of the universe that dictate all matter and energy so trying to make sense of the very small by the way we observe things at our scale is not reasonable.  Still some parallels can be drawn.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not very accurate to make an analogy between atoms and lego bricks. Atoms are complex quantum objects, better imagined as interactions of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrations_of_a_circular_membrane" target="_blank">standing waves</a> in the underlying quantum fields. </p>
<p>A more appropriate analogy is something like guitar strings. There's only six of them but depending on where they are plucked and where they are bound, you can play all the music in the world on them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
