I'd imagine the medium and long-term effects would be greater, assuming the differences in gravitational forces are even significant enough for anyone to notice. </p>
<p>I hope my question makes sense, and apologies if it doesn't... I'm obviously no expert on the subject!<br />
Thanks!  :)</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mars ranges from ~55 to ~400 million km away, which means any signal takes 3-22 minutes to reach us from there. Double that for a round trip. Any time dilation effect is going to be incredibly tiny compared to the delay time, and tiny compared to the <em>variation</em> in delay time.</p>
<p>When we're moving in opposite directions on opposite sides of the Sun, our relative speed adds up to 54 km/s. This gives a time dilation of about 0.5 seconds per year. Time dilation due to the Earth's gravity comes out to about 0.02 seconds per year.</p>
<p>So if you need extreme precision, you will have to take time dilation effects into account - note we have to do this on Earth for GPS satellites anyway. But for most practical communication purposes, the signal delay from the speed of light is a far bigger deal.</p>
<p>Edit: fixed the numbers</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You would not be able to achieve a time dilation that is sufficient to be noticeable. You will be able to detect it with very accurate clocks though.</p>
<p>This was already done for clocks in orbit around earth and GPS is also one of the few systems where they do have to account for time dilation.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, but seems like the case with the highest probability would be syncing events happening both on earth and Mars. If the time measurement for the &quot;event&quot; were important enough, you might need it to be &quot;synced&quot; to within nanoseconds over millennia, and then you'd have to get into the general relativistic effects.</p>
<p>So, you can account for time dilation effects if you want to sync thinks that are happening both on Earth and on Mars. Biggest relative dilation would be when Mars is at apogee and Earth is at perigee. This isn't a frequent occurrence. Even then the dilation would be pretty small over most lengths of time. Perhaps the apogee-perigee combo happens every once in a while...LOOOOOONG while....when the sun is directly between the earth and Mars. That'd add to it, but it would still be small.</p>
<p>You could have a use case for needing to account for the relativistic effects, but you could easily do it...well, with a decent masters holder or doctoral candidate in astrophysics and a six pack to give her as compensation, you could do it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Time is always relative and even on earth we &quot;agree&quot; to a specific time being the one to use. </p>
<p>For most day to day, adjustments via time zone is good enough (e.g. GMT +8) but some things (celestial viewing, navigation) you must adjust time to a specific longitude to get the &quot;exact&quot; time but it is still just a agreed concept to make the predicted events work.</p>
<p>If we communicated with Mars, the time delay means everything is recorded and time on Mars would likely follow the same idea for communication (&quot;expect to receive message at 04:00 GMT&quot;) with the changes due to relativistic effects built-in.</p>
<p>A more complicated question would be what is the Martian calendar/day like. Assuming you care whether it is day or night, a &quot;day&quot; on Mars will drift by about 40 minutes per day so if you use earth timekeeping, within a few weeks you will have noon at midnight. Seasons are even worse.</p>
<p>The relativistic adjustments would just get adjusted to seamlessly and with the exception of a few experts in very specific fields where it matters, nobody would notice.</p>
<p>An example is when we apply a &quot;leap second&quot; to adjust clocks here - nobody notices as long as the people doing work where it matters are aware.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have no idea why others are answering no but then giving you examples of time dilation. Time dilation is enough of a factor on Earth alone that we need to account for it. So yes, they would be situations where time dilation would affect situations that would need to be accounted for</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
