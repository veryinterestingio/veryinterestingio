		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mint and eucalyptus activate the temperature receptors in your nose (or wherever you ingest it), particularly those dealing with low temperatures.  This activation is the same effect that happens when you eat a hot pepper, only the capsaicin in the peppers activate a different receptor (ones that respond to hotter temperatures).</p>
<p>Since the receptors that are activated are telling your brain &quot;Hey I'm really cold&quot;, the brain signals the blood vessels in that area to contract to prevent body heat loss. As the vessels contract, the nasal passages open up allowing you to breath easier.</p>
<p>*Edit: there, I've corrected the &quot;contact&quot;:&quot;contract&quot; problem lol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most popular response is wrong I think. Mint/Menthol/Eucalyptus do not actually reduce or clear nasal congeston they simply trick your brain into thinking you are breathing clearly through your nose.</p>
<p>I am a Pharmacist and my University Professor taught that menthol and eucalyptus activate cold (thermo) receptors when you inhale them into your nasal passage. These are the same cold receptors that are activated when you are inhaling normally via your nasal passages (focus on it now and feel the sensation of cool air in your nasal passage).
The activation of the receptors when your nose is blocked gives you the sensation of achieving adequate imhalation of air through your nose HOWEVER you will also be breathing in through your mouth aswell to compensate for the reduced intake of air through your nose.
Doing steam inhalations with or without menthol/eucalyptus can help to clear your congestion as the steam will help to dissolve the mucus blocking the nasal cavity.
Psuedoephedrine helps to clear nasal congestion by constricting the blood vessels in the nasal passage and reduce mucus formation.
The nasal passagea do not really increaae or decreaae in size it is the amount of mucus up there that restricts airflow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is likely that eucalyptus/mint scents do not clear up a stuffy nose.   An article <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3628651/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3628651/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3628651/</a></a> named The effect of inhaled menthol on upper airway resistance in humans: A randomized controlled crossover study looked at the effect on menthol on nasal congestion.   Albeit a small study, it showed no statistically different between placebo and menthol.   I was unable to find any other study on the subject.  The reason many people have responded that it increases vasodilation is because there are studies of topical menthol showing this effect.  Although smell is small amounts of the substance reaching your nose, we cant jump to the conclusion that it is similar to topical application.   The most likely reason people 'feel' less congested is because menthol (mint) and likely eucalyptus are counter irritants.  By slightly irritating your nasal passage, it feels like more air is passing through but in reality you are only sensing the air more acutely.  More studies would be required to say that mint clears up a stuffy nose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
