They describe the process of recruiting others to help you make more money, which I thought constituted a pyramid scheme. So what’s the difference between the two (if there is one)? Does the FTC regulate and look for pyramid schemes, and if so what criteria do they use?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Listen to the podcast The Dream. It’s an MLM exposé and very well done. The reason MLMs aren’t considered pyramid schemes is that they’re very dedicated to lobbying politicians and running Chambers of Commerce to keep them from being categorized as such.  That’s it. The co-founders of Amway (the Devoses, as in Betsy DeVos, and the Van Andels) run the US Chamber of Commerce. They use this power to keep the laws favorable to them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have noted, pure Ponzi schemes don’t really sell a product, making money solely from downstream participants.  </p>
<p>MLMs have essentially exploited a loophole, purporting to sell products through the downstream.  But the downstream almost always purchases more products than resells them. So it’s the act of joining that creates money for the MLM and the upstream.  </p>
<p>So, everyone involved has more of a financial interest in recruiting new downstream members, than they do in having anyone actually purchasing products.  </p>
<p>This is why the overwhelming majority of MLM participants, overall, actually LOSE money.  </p>
<p>It’s still a pyramid scheme-just not an illegal one, but it’s still predatory, fraudulent and unethical.  And yes, I’m certain they’ve used their lobbying power to keep this loophole as a “legal” option, at least in the US.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pyramid Schemes don't have an actual product behind them - ultimately it's all smoke and mirrors.  MLMs have an actual product, though the methodology behind the two are nearly identical.</p>
<p>Edit: Since there's some confusion here - when I'm referring to &quot;Pyramid Schemes&quot; - I'm talking about the classical Ponzi scheme.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are a pyramid scheme. They are not, however, an illegal Ponzi scheme, which involves bringing in new sellers constantly buying product, which funds the whole organization. There are no real product sales to consumers. (And sometimes no real product). </p>
<p>MLM and pyramid schemes do rely MOSTLY on getting new sellers to buy product as their source of income. But they do have actual products, and some actual customers. You have to ask why if it's a good product, they don't just sell it in stores. The answer is that the sellers themselves are the product. The product wouldn't move if it was in a store (which would be massively cheaper and easier for most people with a product to sell.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To be a legit business, the money has to come from selling a product. To be a pyramid, the money comes from recruiting others. </p>
<p>A true MLM company would have distributors making money only when a product is sold, and there's no immediate benefit to recruiting another person. They also have to sell products to people not contracting main company. The befit from recruits only happens when they buy/sell an actual product.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
