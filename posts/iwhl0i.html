If you wanted to charge your phone off a cup of hot coffee, sure, use a Peltier device. But it probably isn't going to be powering neighborhoods.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: no.</p>
<p>Longer answer: no, steam turbines are much more efficient and simple than anything else we have come up with. We are talking about up to 80% efficiency with about 50% average (edit: ideal, multistage turbine), nothing comes even close to that. Them being simple, having non toxic materials that are abundant makes it even more attractive even if we did have more efficient methods.</p>
<p>Somethings just were so good at the moment they were invented that afterwards, we can only get incremental, marginal improvements. Same goes with electric motors, they have not changed much in a century. You can take AC motor from the 1950s and have roughly same efficiency as its modern counterpart. You can expect better tolerances, less friction, better cooling and less materials being used but.. that is about all we have been able to do in more than a half a century. Steam turbine is kind of the same, it is hard to get another huge step when we started with so great concept.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing to put ahead can't convert heat itself into electricity, only heat difference, because of thermodynamics.</p>
<p>Peltier element can directly create electricity from heat difference, but they aren't very efficent. Sterling engines are theoretically very efficient, but have issues to be built to scale (and even if possible extremely costly).</p>
<p>BTW: I consider it interesting when talking with people, regarding nuclear plants, they have the idea that radiation is somehow directly converted to electricity, albeit actually all the nuclear core is used for, is generating steam, to push through a turbine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The maximum possible efficiency for any heat-to-useful-energy device (a &quot;heat engine&quot;) is given by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnot%27s_theorem_\(thermodynamics\)" target="_blank">Carnot limit</a>:  1-Tc/Th, where Th is the temperature of the heat source and Tc is the temperature of the cooling apparatus.</p>
<p>Modern steam turbines operate at temperatures of 400-500 C (700-800  Kelvin) and have cooling stages at about 30 C (300 Kelvin), so their maximum possible Carnot efficiency is around 60%.  Actual efficiencies are typically around <a href="http://www.thermopedia.com/content/1151/" target="_blank">36-42%</a>.</p>
<p>So, not quite perfect.  But the optimal Carnot efficiency can only be achieved with an engine that runs infinitely slowly, which is more than a little bit useless, so 40% is about as perfect as things are likely to get.</p>
<p>The main limitation is the temperature tolerance of the metal parts.  Some sort of amazing improvement in high-temperature metallurgy could increase Th, and raise overall efficiency.</p>
<p>Oh, and two other useful data points: once heat has been turned into a spinning rotor, converting it to electricity via a generator is well over 90% efficient.  </p>
<p>And if you want to compare to commercial photovoltaic solar panels, those are in the ballpark of 18% efficient.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a device called a thermocouple that's basically a solar panel for heat, but it's far less efficient than a steam generator. The reason for thermocouples' inefficiency is complex, but keep in mind that steam turbines are actually fairly efficient - up to 55% thermal efficiency.
On the other hand, thermocouples have the advantage of being rugged and relatively light-weight, which makes them perfect for some applications, such as deep space probes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
