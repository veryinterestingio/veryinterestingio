		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Each year on April 25, we celebrate National DNA Day, which commemorates the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003 and the discovery of DNA's double helix in 1953. On this day students, teachers, and the public learn more about genetics and genomics. In honor of DNA Day this year, the Intramural Research Program (IRP) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is partnering with the NIH's National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to bring you an &quot;Ask Me Anything&quot; with three experts on the many ways that advances in the genomic sciences are changing our lives.</p>
<p>Alexander Katz, M.D., and Laura Koehly, Ph.D., of NHGRI, along with Saskia Sanderson, Ph.D., of University College London, will answer questions on the latest discoveries and research endeavors in the field of genetics, including The Genomic Ascertainment Cohort (TGAC), a partnership between the NIH and Inova Health System that aims to gather genomic data from many different sources into a single, searchable system to enable researchers to study the link between genetic variants and individual traits. In addition, they will discuss how knowledge of the human genome and rapidly declining cost of DNA sequencing are affecting our physical, mental, and emotional health, as well as altering our behavior and the ways we interact with one another.</p>
<p><strong>Your hosts today are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Laura Koehly, Ph.D.</strong>, Chief of the Social and Behavioral Research Branch and Head of the Social Network Methods Section at the NIH's National Human Genome Research Institute.</li>
<li><strong>Alexander Katz, M.D.</strong>, Clinical Geneticist and Principal Investigator, TGAC, NIH National Human Genome Research Institute.</li>
<li><strong>Dr. Saskia Sanderson, Ph.D.</strong>, a Research Psychologist and Senior Research Fellow at the Institute of Health Informatics at University College London (UCL).</li>
