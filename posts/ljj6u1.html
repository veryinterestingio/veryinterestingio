		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ones that you say are symmetrical are actually less symmetrical than you'd think. The brain lateralises (so only one side has a particular function) some cognitive functions. The right lung has 3 lobes, the left has 2. The left kidney is higher than the right. </p>
<p>It's kind of a function of fitting everything into the neat space that you call your body and having to serve different functions. The general schematic of the heart is symmetric, but the left ventricle becomes enlarged because you need it to pump more pressure through the body. The liver has different sized lobes, likely because of how much each lobe of the liver receives blood when you develop. The stomach and intestines start off as a tube but become different because different parts of the intestines have different roles, and they rotate in complicated ways to fit everything into the body. </p>
<p>There's not really an underlying special cause that separates organs that are symmetric with ones that aren't. It's just kind of how the cards fall when your body grows.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>so, most people here are arguing for there being less symmetry than you think, and it's not exactly wrong that one teste hangs lower and that kidneys aren't 100% the same, but i would argue the opposite kinda. </p>
<p>the fact that we have so many pairs of organs is a result of our fetal development being <em>very</em> symmetrical. this is obvious in most organs, two lungs, two kidneys, two testes/ovaries etc. but most of the ones that appear singular are developed in a similar fashion. fetuses actually have two hearts that then grow together, and you can kinda look at the heart as two separate pumps for the two circulatory systems. your brain has two lobes of course, but so does your liver. really the only odd one out here is the stomach and the instestines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The question of how asymmetry is generated in an embryo that starts off with completely symmetrical morphology is still not answered entirely. </p>
<p>Basically, all bilateral symmetrical organs like lungs, kidneys or gonads are derived from precursor cells on both sides of the embryo; each develops into one organ.</p>
<p>The non-symmetrical organs either originate as a structure in the centre plane of the embryo (e.g. the gastrointestinal tract, which is a long tube from the mouth to the anus that elongates and loops in special ways) or derived from two bilateral structures that fuse in the middle (e.g. the heart). </p>
<p>It's still not completely clear how cells know if they are on the right or the left side and therefore, if they should proliferate and initiate bulging and elongation or not. And still, in most humans, the colons starts on right and the aorta is on the left.</p>
<p>In the early embro, there is a region that is called &quot;primitive node&quot; which carries motile cilia - moving hair-like cell appendages - that can create a fluid current. One theory states that this current induces a gradient of molecules in the embryo that determines which side is which. There is a disease called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_ciliary_dyskinesia" target="_blank">&quot;Primary ciliary dyskinesia&quot;</a> in which these cilia can't move properly. Apparently, the generation of asymmetry in this case is random, which is why patients often have what is called &quot;Situs inversus&quot; - an inverted arrangement of organs with their heart on the right side and their liver on the left.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually have a pelvic kidney.</p>
<p>Found out during my ultrasound with my daughter. They tec was searching and searching and I'm like, &quot;uh.. can you not find something?&quot; Apparently it's very common for organs not to be where they &quot;should&quot;.
You might even have a pelvic kidney and not know!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
