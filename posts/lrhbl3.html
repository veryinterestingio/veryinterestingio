		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two main reasons: Power tools use smaller motors that spin very fast but that don't have much torque, so they need gearing to reduce the speed and increase the torque.</p>
<p>The noise is produced by the fast-running motor itself and a lot also comes from the gearbox. The strongest and lightest gears have straight cut teeth, but they're also quite loud. The gears used in electric cars are helical cut and much quieter, if they have gears at all.</p>
<p>It would be quite difficult to have a power tool without a gearbox because slow-spinning electric motors with a lot of torque would be physically larger and a lot heavier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Teslas and other EVs have a single reduction gear that allows the motor to spin many times faster than the wheels, to enhance wheel-torque and also efficiency so they can get a lot of power from lower amps.</p>
<p>The reduction gear in a Tesla is a sophisticated double herringbone gear, which is specifically designed to handle high power while running very quietly. </p>
<p>Also, there are anti-vibration mounts for the gear housing, along with noise insulation.</p>
<p>A cordless drill is under a tremendous pressure to provide adequate performance at the lowest possible price, so the reduction gear is made very cheaply of a strong design.</p>
<p>AvE has some very good tool teardown videos on youtube.</p>
<p>You &quot;could&quot; make a cordless drill run much quieter for maybe an extra $20 per drill, but...millions of customers worldwide dont seem to be asking for that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it might have to do with the type of motor. Electric cars apparently almost always use DC brushless (<a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/induction-versus-dc-brushless-motors" target="_blank">https://www.tesla.com/blog/induction-versus-dc-brushless-motors</a>)</p>
<p>And a lot of power tools use a noisier type of motor:</p>

<p>Related, my washer has a direct drive digital inverter brushless motor, and it's eerily quiet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Power tools have almost no shielding between the motor and you. Most of the sound created by the motor is exposed quite directly to the environment.  </p>
<p>Electric cars on the other hand have an entire auto frame, various metals, rubber, upholstery, etc to distribute and absorb the sound as well as environmental noise (such as tires rotating on the ground) to mask the comparatively little noise that does leak past all that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: Different types of motors, bearings and gears.  Power tools are made to be cheap, so they use noisy and inefficient parts.  Expensive or very large power tools, and electric cars need to use more reliable and efficient parts and tend to run very quietly.  </p>
<p>Motors: Basic power tools use brushed motors.  These motors are cheap and simple, but they throw of sparks, make noise, and need to have parts regularly replaced.  Electric cars use brushless motors, which are much quieter and more efficient, and generally don't need much maintenance at all.  </p>
<p>Bearings: When you have spinning shafts under load, you need to support those shafts without too much friction.  Bearings are used for this.  Power tools generally use ball bearings, which have a limited lifespan and make quite a bit of noise when spinning fast.  Cars use heavy duty roller bearings, which are quieter, but still need to be replaced regularly (one of the few maintenance items on an electric car).  </p>
<p>Gears: Small power tools use motors that spin very fast but don't have much torque.  Generally this needs to be turned into a slower rotation with more torque to be useful.  A gearbox is included in almost every power tool.  The gears inside a power tool gearbox are called &quot;straight cut&quot; gears, which are cheap and easy to make, but create a huge racket.  This is responsible for most of the noise of a power tool, the loud coarse grinding/whining noise.  A straight cut gearbox for a car would make an unbelievable racket.  Car transmissions and gearboxes use helical cut gears, which are more expensive but much quieter.  Even with the helical cut gears, the gearbox whine is still one of the loudest noises made by an electric car.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
