		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Materials science has a good understanding of how materials fail from stress, so how the bridge or tunnel can fail is pretty well understood and they know what to look for. Obviously the main way a bridge or tunnel would fail after years of use is fatigue.  Fatigue typically starts as microscopic cracks in the material that grow over time. So inspectors will look for cracks, and if they aren't too long, track their growth over multiple inspections, because many cracks do not pose an imminent threat. And appropriate repairs are undertaken for those that do become a problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work for a road network managing organisation and in my department we have the unit in charge of the bridge monitoring. Here's what we do to ensure we don't end up on the front page of the news for a very bad reason.</p>
<p>Most people think bridges fail abruptly and catastrophically. They don't. A failure like the Genova Bridge was probably in the making for several years, and if the monitoring was done correctly they could have taken measures to prevent it, or at worst to close the bridge before it happened.</p>
<p>That's why we have an extensive monitoring set up in place.</p>
<p>Every 6 year a very detailed inspection take place. All the components of the bridge are inspected visually but thoroughly : you check the supports, the cables, the curbs, the road or whatever the bridge carry, the water disposal system. Everything. If you see anything out of the ordinary we do more : radar analysis for example would allow us to check the concrete reinforcement steel. We can take sample of concrete or steel and such. We can also decide to use gage and sensors to really follow how things are evolving, like in real time and get a sense of how fast the bridge is getting damages.</p>
<p>Every 3 years we have a checklist (taylor made for each bridge) that we check. That gives us a grade (from 3 to 1) for the general state of the bridge. 3 being in need of repair, 2 for needing monitoring and 1 for of no concern. Again this inspection is only visual but anything out of the ordinary could lead to a more thorough inspection or analysis. The grade is used by our DoT to get us funding for maintenance and repairs.</p>
<p>Every year we have the &quot;normal inspection&quot;, again visually. It's mostly used to check if the minor defects noticed in one of the big inspection, that didn't warrant more actions, does not evolve too quickly or too badly.</p>
<p>We also have yearly and tri-yearly maintenance actions to take. Mostly to keep water out of the places it shouldn't go. Water is the biggest enemy of anything that has steel or concrete like bridge or rod. And God forbid if there is water and bellow zero temperature. That's the bane of civil engineering. Inspections are also used to check if the yearly maintenance has been carried as they should.</p>
<p>For the bridge who have problems, most of the one under our purview are concrete ones so I'm gonna focus on those, we have several tools at our disposal.first we have the original plans and data sheet so we can estimate how damaged the bridge is. We also use them to know,for example, where are the main support steel in the concrete to check if they could be corroded (in case of cracks) or how many of them are they. Bridge are generally build for 80 to 100 years so if we don't have those data, we're basically shooting in the dark. </p>
<p>Given the initial construction and design data we can easily recompute the load capacity and security factor of the bridge, and depending on the damage and results decide to reduce the authorised load. In my case most of the bridge are designed to accommodate normal traffic and exceptional loads up to 200 tons (normal trucks are 44t in my country). We can reduce that, and have done so in the past.</p>
<p>We can decide to close the road or just lanes (luckily never had to do that).</p>
<p>But often we just launch study to fix the damage components : rebuild a concrete beams, add strengthening cables, redo the support (which must be done every few decades for some type anyway), repaint, clear the drainage pipes, fix cracks in the concrete ...</p>
<p>For a three if mine we are in the process of designing replacement because in The next 5 to 10 years we estimate that the load bearing capacity will have decreased too much and the safety margin won't be enough to allow everyday traffic on it (given the uncertainties of what everyday traffic in everyday weather actually is).</p>
<p>As other commenters said, material science is good enough to allow us to estimate how and at what speed materials break so we know, given proposer maintenance and monitoring, that we have time to carry all of that.</p>
<p>Sorry for the typos and such, I'm in my phone and not a native English speaker. I might have used the wrongs words for some things too.</p>
<p>Edit : fixed some typos. There were really too much of them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, the truth is both reassuring and frightening. Bridges, and really almost any architecture, are built with a huge added strength just to be sure. Of course nowadays we have computers to calculate exact forces and materials needed. But at least up to recent times I heard a rule of &quot;when not sure - multiply by 1.5&quot; among architects and that is a general approach. </p>
<p>The scary part is that in a lot of countries, US included, there aren't nearly enough inspectors to keep an eye on ALL of the infrastructure we have. Bridges, dams, tunnels - a modern country had A LOT of them. So, they don't get inspected as often as they should.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The owner of the infrastructure asset typically hires a consultant to perform routine and scheduled inspections to look for normal wear and tear, fatigue, cracks, corrosion, etc.  This used to be an in-house inspection department but like most everything else nowadays, it’s done by outside consultants.</p>
<p>Examples of owners would be: city/town/county/municipality for roads, bridges, sewers, etc.; transit authorities for train and subway tracks, bridges and tunnels; the big private railway companies for track and bridges; departments/ministries of transportation for highways, bridges, tunnels, etc.</p>
<p>All of these owners use the inspection reports to develop a 5 or 10 year maintenance program  and prioritize other repairs or replacements that are needed sooner.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Civil engineer here. There is one major thing that I'm not seeing in alot of these explanations, that is how engineers design things to fail in expected ways. In most major pieces of infrastructure, the primary materials in use are steel and concrete. Thanks to alot of material science we understand these materials very well. Because of that, engineers can sequence failures to minimize loss of life, or allow time for the problem to be fixed ( keep in mind I'm talking about regular use cases here. Mega earthquakes and alien death rays are too expensive to design for, so when those hit you just have to put your head between your legs and pray.)</p>
<p>So how do we sequence failures to make them safer? That depends on the materials in use, but I'll stick with steel and concrete because they are so common. Steel is strong, flexible, and ductile. Meaning it can bend and stretch without breaking. Concrete is really strong, but mainly in compression, it also fails really fast when it's max loads are reached.  So for a steel reinforced Concrete beam we design the steel to start stretching and flexing before the concrete might give, this creates cracks in the concrete that we can see before the entire structure collapses. Depending on the mode or severity of the failure we might be able to repair the structure, or it might be condemned.</p>
<p>Other than sequencing failure, factors of safety are designed into the structure ( so we design it for heavier loads than we think it should see under normal conditions). We also regularly inspect structures for cracks, or other signs of failure. Hope that helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
