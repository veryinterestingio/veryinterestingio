		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Instincts, or fixed actions, are part of your genome and moderated by the complexity of the brain.</p>
<p>Sharks have very a primitive brain. If you compared their brain to a human brain, it would look a lot like a fetus' brain well before birth. There is no complex cerebral cortex helping them learn complicated tasks or deviate very far from what is already imprinted (instinct). They feel hungry, they look for food. They sense blood, they think meal. A shark would never say fish are friends because a shark only knows that fish are food. It simply can't learn that fish are friends.</p>
<p>On the other hand, humans have a <em>massive</em> cerebral cortex that gives us a very high degree of &quot;behavioural flexibility.&quot; The more we learn and adapt, the less we rely on more reflexive instincts. We feel hungry and want food, but we look to things like learned information, learned behaviours, and social needs when we decide what we want to eat, where we want to eat, etc. We can look at both side of the fish-are-friends vs fish-are-food debate choose to eat or not eat fish.</p>
<p>I don't really know how arachnids compare to animals. Spiders do have rather complicated brains for such little dudes. [Up to 80% of small spiders is their brain!] (<a href="https://braindecoder.com/post/spider-brain-great-mystery-in-a-tiny-head-1094514994" target="_blank">https://braindecoder.com/post/spider-brain-great-mystery-in-a-tiny-head-1094514994</a>) I suspect it is probably something imprinted, too. Looking back over hundreds and hundreds of generations, spiders imprinted with the &quot;genetic memory&quot; to build successful webs may have been more likely to survive and continue to pass those traits on to their offspring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Instincts are genetically programmed. In humans babies have many instinctual reflexes that doctors use to check to make sure the baby is healthy. The answer to you question is that some basic forms of behaviour like reflexes or behaviours related to survival are genetically encoded as a result of hundreds (thousands, millions) of years of evolution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A spider 'knows' because it's instinctual, that's definitionally true. It's something that needn't be 'learnt'. We have an instinct as babies to turn our heads if contact cheeks is made and then we have an instinct to suck as well. In a sense we came out pre-programmed to be able to do that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
