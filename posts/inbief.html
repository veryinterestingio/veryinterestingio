		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The point of soap is to allow the oils on your skin to mix with the water in the sink/shower. There are things other than soap that will also do that.</p>
<p>Soap has regulatory definitions (per the FDA, &quot;the bulk of the nonvolatile matter in the product consists of an alkali salt of fatty acids and the product's detergent properties are due to the alkali-fatty acid compounds.&quot;)</p>
<p>If it doesn't meet that definition, it is not soap, and it's likely another cosmetic regulated by them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most &quot;soap&quot; isn't actually soap. In order to be soap a product has to be made with rendered fats, typically lard. Most things we generalize as &quot;soap&quot; today contain nothing of the sort and by law can't be called soap in the same way things we might consider &quot;ice cream&quot; are labeled as &quot;frozen dairy desert&quot; because they don't contain enough milk fats to qualify for the name &quot;ice cream.&quot; Or how those individually wrapped neon yellow slices are called &quot;cheese food&quot; instead of &quot;cheese.&quot;</p>
<p>One of the FDA's biggest jobs is making sure to maintain the definitions of things like this and making sure that corporations don't use lesser and lesser quality ingredients and fillers without paying the price of having to change what they call their product.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whenever you see something awkwardly named like that it's probably because it falls outside the legal definition of that category of product. Almost all products have legally defined compositions so that things can be taxed correctly, and you can't just call your item something just to get around the taxes applicable to that item. If there are high taxes on cheese, you can't just label your cheese &quot;peanut butter&quot;. There are definitions, and if your item doesn't meet the definition then you need to call it something else. It's possible that &quot;soap&quot; requires a certain amount of some ingredient that hotel soap doesn't meet, probably for cost reasons, and so they need to call it something that circumvents the restriction, like you often see with cheeses or butters or jellys/jams.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it’s not soap, it’s a detergent. Just like Dove and a whole bunch of other bars out there.</p>
<p>I used to run my own little soap company when I tried to walk away from tech(was burnt out). The science and artistry of it all brought me to the world of soap. Having also suffering from psoriasis, I was extremely curious as to the differences I was noticing between my soap and what I’d been using my whole life.</p>
<p>I don’t want to rant too long about it, but that’s when I noticed most things I had bought don’t have the word soap on any of the packaging. As someone stated somewhere else in the thread, they can’t legally call it soap if it doesn’t meet certain criteria.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
