		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The origin of most of them is pretty boring: Somebody chose them and published them in a book.</p>
<p>The reason most researchers think they were deliberately chosen rather than naturally arising from language is the first recorded uses of many them appear in compendiums of terms rather than organically in other writing. And the compendiums were all published around the same time. These compendiums include:</p>
<p>The Bokys of Haukyng and Huntyng, 1486</p>
<p>Boke of Seynt Albans, 1486</p>
<p>Oxford English Dictionary, 1475 &quot;A morther of crowys&quot;</p>
<p>However, some names for groups of animals did appear organically in other earlier writing: a pack of dogs, a gaggle of geese. These organic names probably inspired the authors.</p>
<p>They disappeared for a while after publication (yet another reason to believe they were not really organic in the first place) until they were repopularized by An Exaltation of Larks in 1968.</p>
<p>Random aside: Chinese has over 100 different special &quot;measure words&quot; for every noun, not just animals. English has some too (pair of pants or pair of scissors) but not nearly as many as Chinese.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a book: An Exaltation of Larks, which covers all this. I last read it in HS, back before 1960, so I don't recall too much from it.</p>
<p>It covers both traditional venereal terms, like and exultation of larks, as well as newer ones, such as an harrumph of professors emeriti.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
