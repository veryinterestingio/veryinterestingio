		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>70% alcohol has 30% water, and that water is necessary for the alcohol to interact at all with the cells it’s killing.</p>
<p>It’s like cooking pancakes. You know how when your pan is really hot and you put in pancake batter, it cooks the outside really fast? And then you can flip it, but it does the same thing to the other side and the middle doesn’t cook very well? 90% alcohol is like that. It doesn’t penetrate well into cells or clumps of microbes because it just fries everything it touches on the outside. The 70% alcohol is like cooking on medium heat with a moderately hot pan. It contacts the outside, too, but the water helps it penetrate to cook the inside (denature proteins deeper) as well. </p>
<p>From <a href="https://blog.gotopac.com/2017/05/15/why-is-70-isopropyl-alcohol-ipa-a-better-disinfectant-than-99-isopropanol-and-what-is-ipa-used-for/" target="_blank">https://blog.gotopac.com/2017/05/15/why-is-70-isopropyl-alcohol-ipa-a-better-disinfectant-than-99-isopropanol-and-what-is-ipa-used-for/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The presence of water is a crucial factor in destroying or inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microorganisms with isopropyl alcohol. Water acts as a catalyst and plays a key role in denaturing the proteins of vegetative cell membranes. 70% IPA solutions penetrate the cell wall more completely which permeates the entire cell, coagulates all proteins, and therefore the microorganism dies. Extra water content slows evaporation, therefore increasing surface contact time and enhancing effectiveness. Isopropyl alcohol concentrations over 91% coagulate proteins instantly. Consequently, a protective layer is created which protects other proteins from further coagulation.</p>
<p>Solutions &gt; 91% IPA may kill some bacteria, but require longer contact times for disinfection, and enable spores to lie in a dormant state without being killed. A 50% isopropyl alcohol solution kills Staphylococcus Aureus in less than 10 seconds (pg. 238), yet a 90% solution with a contact time of over two hours is ineffective.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edit: Because there’s been some confusion, I’d like to add two points. First, higher concentrations of alcohol solutions (specifically isopropyl) may still be superior as solvents, for use on things like electronics for cleaning, because water is generally bad for electronics. Second, what we’re talking about above you should think of as referring only to ethanol and isopropyl alcohol (which is not safe to consume). There are other alcohols but we’re just sticking to the ones commonly used.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Some people have questioned the source, which is good and part of science. The source offered a decent write-up of what numerous PhD mentors have taught me, and it’s consistent with the science. At the risk of making this too long, here’s what the CDC has to say, from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/disinfection/disinfection-methods/chemical.html" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/disinfection/disinfection-methods/chemical.html</a> </p>
<p>Adding water enhances effectiveness of isopropyl and ethyl alcohols: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most feasible explanation for the antimicrobial action of alcohol is denaturation of proteins. This mechanism is supported by the observation that absolute ethyl alcohol, a dehydrating agent, is less bactericidal than mixtures of alcohol and water because proteins are denatured more quickly in the presence of water </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isopropanol and ethanol effective bactericides</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The bactericidal activity of various concentrations of ethyl alcohol (ethanol) was examined against a variety of microorganisms in exposure periods ranging from 10 seconds to 1 hour 483. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was killed in 10 seconds by all concentrations of ethanol from 30% to 100% (v/v), and Serratia marcescens, E, coli and Salmonella typhosa were killed in 10 seconds by all concentrations of ethanol from 40% to 100%. The gram-positive organisms Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes were slightly more resistant, being killed in 10 seconds by ethyl alcohol concentrations of 60%–95%. Isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol) was slightly more bactericidal than ethyl alcohol for E. coli and S. aureus 489.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kills viruses at these concentrations </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ethyl alcohol, at concentrations of 60%–80%, is a potent virucidal agent inactivating all of the lipophilic viruses (e.g., herpes, vaccinia, and influenza virus) and many hydrophilic viruses (e.g., adenovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, and rotaviruses but not hepatitis A virus (HAV) 58 or poliovirus) 49. </p>

<p>Isopropanol similar to chlorhexidine

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a pharmaceutical production technician,I use 70% Isopropyl alcohol daily. The 30% sterilized water allows it time to spread the alcohol over the surface without evaporating too fast. I believe it takes about 15 seconds of contact time for it to disinfect, but at 90% it would only last 5 seconds so not enough time to fully kill even half the bacteria/spores.
Plus 70% IPA smells good as hell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with evaporation but to be clear alcohol isn't a very good disinfectant in the first place. It's more of a germicide.</p>
<p>You need a large contact time, if it evaporates you're not soaking. Soaking tools in it works well. In soaking you find the strongest stuff you can find (we use denatured alcohol so 100%) With surfaces it's almost always recommended to use bleach as a disinfectant, (which can still have a soak time of 10-15 min) and alcohol as the noncorrosive, sterile cleaner to wipe up the bleach residue.</p>
<p>O and for most phenolic disinfectants like lysol, they need to dry on the surface. If you don't let them dry you're reducing their effectiveness. </p>
<p>My whole family is in this world. I work in medical device manufacturing where everything has to be kept sterile (we make alcohol swabs and we have to sterilize the alcohol tanks), my sister is the environmental and health manager for a hospital (she is directly responsible for any hospital born pathogens), my father managers the water treatment and supply for our town. </p>
<p>Also people at all your major colleges say the same thing. </p>
