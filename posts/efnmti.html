		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The muscular and cartilage structure is pre-determined by genetics. How you use it as you grow will determine how it develops. If you're a woman, it can change with hormones during and after pregnancy/childbirth. It changes with age.</p>
<p>It's a muscular system. I'm not over 6' but I can still learn how to play basketball. If you're asking this because you're wondering if it's possible to learn how to sing better the answer is <em>yes you can if you have a good teacher who knows what they're doing because everyone's physiology is slightly different</em>. The biggest obstacles to singing are mental, not physical.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both.
Your anatomy will shape so much for you, and define your range and your upper and lower limits.
Where you grow up will decide part of your pitch. For example, in the UK, people in Newcastle have a higher overall pitch sound than people in liverpool, and that's inherited through accent.
Some people also may make conscious choices to sound a particular way, Marylin Monroe's famous breathy voice apparently helped her overcome a stammer.
You also find that hormones and hormonal cycles change the pitch too depending on the balance of testosterone or estrogen at any time.</p>
<p>Edit: just to add to this, you can change your speaking range in different ways. A lot of people will tighten or loosen their vocal cords (folds) which you can change easily, and you'll see in TV and movies when people try to imitate the voice of another gender. For a more long lasting and less damaging option, you can train yourself to hold your larynx/voice box higher or lower in your throat (it's really moveable, touch near your Adams apple when you swallow and try noises at the different positions).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Usually when I'm talking with her or I'm just everywhere else than my unit, I'm talking my regular voice but when I'm with my boys I have this lower, deeper sound of voice. When I'm seeing her in a short time from leaving unit I &quot;forget&quot; to drop this second, more respectful and commanding voice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
