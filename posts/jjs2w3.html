		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you have figured out the reason why even when newspapers were popular the comic section was unchanging to an extreme degree. It was hard to gauge if some new comic was or wasn't doing well, so most newspapers just run the same comics they always ran and you have a lot of comics with 40-100 year runs instead of it being something that changes up much at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Management and editorial control, polls, focus groups, fan letters, references in public discourse, television tie-ins, bandwagon effect, etc. More recently, web tracking from online versions of newspapers give more fine-grained metrics.</p>
<p>How do newspapers know which reporters are writing great stories? Most of them aren't on the front page either - it's the same answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Times have changed, of course, but traditionally cartoons are syndicated which is a fancy way of saying that the cartoon signs a deal with a company that negotiates publishing with newspapers/other forms of media. These middlemen could be compared to agents or marketers in other industries and they often represent more than one client. </p>
<p>Individual cartoons can have an impact on the public’s view of that particular strip, but usually it is up to the paper’s editors to choose to cancel their contract with the syndicate.</p>
<p>The advantage to doing it this way is that the artist is free to focus on their work, and let others get dirty with the negotiations. The downside is that the artist is in effect paying someone to do the negotiating and may not have much control over where their work appears or how much they get paid</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
