But that got me thinking about what would happen if that was possible. Does more exposure to a virus cause you to get sicker, or would the immune response be the same? Maybe as a side question, would the person from the meme (assuming they were healthy and wouldn't have died from COVID normally) have died from that much exposure?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The measure of how many viral particles are either circulating or you are otherwise exposed to is called &quot;viral load&quot; or similarly &quot;infectious dose.&quot; Speaking very generally, our bodies do pretty well fighting off infection when viral load is small, as those few particles would have to successfully reproduce, and there would be simply more time available for the immune system to catch up. If your viral load is higher, then the infection can begin to rapidly spread throughout the body before the immune system had a chance to stop it. </p>
<p>With respiratory viruses like COVID19 the infectious dose correlates with how sick you get.</p>
<p>There are, however, a ton of variables to this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, yes, more is worse.  The body's immune system reacts to any threat or injury to the body.  For every virus particle in the body, the immune system has to fight off an even greater threat.  Yet, the body's immune system is not infinitely powerful.  Thus, while the body may be able to fight off a dozen viral particles with ease, it may not be able to fight off a million particles.</p>
<p>As for what would happen if someone ate a teaspoon of COVID particles, well, that is affected by many, many factors and would call for intense speculation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Viral load is a thing. It's the reason that wearing a mask reduces risk of you transmitting the virus, even though it's not airtight. </p>
<p>Also a big reason we get &quot;sick&quot; isn't even the virus itself, but our immune systems response to it (not true for everything, of course). The more virus in you, the bigger immune response, the worst those symptoms are</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I googled this for an hour the other day. I could find no peer reviewed journal articles finding a correlation between infectious dose and severity of Covid symptoms.</p>
<p>Early on, many journals published theories that such a correlation exists but actually showing it with any evidence would be quite difficult.</p>
<p>The Syrian Golden Hamster can be infected by the coronavirus that causes Covid, however, there don't seem to be any experiments on them with infectious dose as the variable (yes they get sick and lose weight but they clear the virus in about 14 days.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
