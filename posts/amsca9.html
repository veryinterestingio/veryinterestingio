		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ignoring the hard drive element of modern games, for games that <em>did</em> run entirely from the disc, the non chronological nature of their storage wouldn't have been a problem. Unlike a music CD, it wasn't necessary to read the disc from start to finish in one go. (Indeed, even with a music CD, you can use track select to change the order in which it is read.) When a game needed to load more data from the disc, it would know where on the disc that is located, and start reading from that point.</p>
<p>There would still be some care taken with data placement - the time taken to find the correct location on disc (seek time) is a factor in the overall loading speed, especially if the system is constantly jumping around for fragmented data.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's ignore for a moment whether or not the game is actually stored on the disc these days, as several people have mentioned. A few years ago, the game would have been stored on the disc, so your question still stands.</p>
<p>A game works rather differently from a movie. A movie would be recorded on a disc in the order you'd play it back. The images you see on the screen for a movie are actually stored on the disc. For a game, you can't do that (usually), because the player can make choices, and there would be too many images.</p>
<p>The way it's done instead is that the disc contains a huge number of files... much like a computer's hard drive. There are several different types of files on there that do different things. As an example, let's look at a horse you might see in a game:</p>
<ul>
<li>There might be a file that describes what a horse looks like (as if it were a statue).</li>
<li>Another file might describe how the limbs of a horse move as it gallops.</li>
<li>Another file might contain the sound a horse makes when it is running.</li>
<li>Yet another file might describe how a horse behaves when various things happen to it (for instance: &quot;if a player hits you on the rump, play the 'whinny' sound and gallop away from the player for 1 minute.&quot;).</li>
<li>Then there might be another file that describes an area the player can walk through (&quot;there is a brown horse at this spot and it wanders around at random in this area until a player does something to it.&quot;).</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, there is a main program to pull all these different types of files together. It follows a set of rules the game designers have written into its files to show you, for example, a horse wandering around grazing in a field and which whinnies and runs away if you slap it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No data is stored in &quot;order&quot; for games on disc. The open world's you are used to seeing are divided into separate sections of data. That's why you get a loading screen sometimes. </p>
<p>The computer has a certain amount of memory that that section of open world gets loaded to. Once you go to a different section it now loads that new section.</p>
<p>Those sections do not have to be in order, but they do have to have a file name that the computer knows to load for each section.</p>
<p>Common things like certain objects &quot;you and your weapons&quot; are always loaded and in memory as well as the game &quot;program&quot; but not necessarily all places you can visit.</p>
<p>All the data is written on the discs as bumps and pits, representing the 0's and 1's that make up the files.</p>
<p>Playing a game that was downloaded instead of on disc is the same process, but much faster so things load quicker. This can be improved further by installing the game onto an ssd, making load times even shorter.</p>
<p>This is also why adding ram to a computer can make things faster, the computer doesn't have to keep going back to the disc or disk to get the data to load the next section.</p>
<p>You don't have to know where physically your picture you took on your cell phone is located, knowing where each file of the game is located physically is the same premise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Game CDs are data discs.  There’s a table that indexes the locations (track and “sector”). It’ Basically a hard disk that you can’t write to.</p>
<p>When a new section of the game is entered, an index (that’s on the CD is consulted), the CDs reading head moves to the appropriate place and reads the target information.  This is termed random-access, although the term is largely accurate, it’ a little bit of a misnomer. </p>
<p>Music CDs have a different index structure that is more conducive to streaming.  This would be termed sequential access.</p>
<p>I am using the term random and sequential a little bit loosely here.  The terms are being used as descriptive, not for strictly computer science definitions(this is ELI5 after all).</p>
<p>The decision as to what kind of disk a CD is going to be happens at format time.  Formatting a disk lays down the digital infrastructure to then be used during it’s expected purpose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
