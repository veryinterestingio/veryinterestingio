		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, they don't have unique keys.</p>
<p>Most locks that we interact with on a day-to-day basis function by having a rotating cylinder that controls a locking mechanism, and inside that cylinder are 4-6 pin-stacks; that is, a spring-loaded pair of pins that are stacked on top of each other. There is a visible line where these pins sit on top of each other, called the shear line; when the shear line of all of the pins in the cylinder lines up with the space between the lock cylinder and its housing, the cylinder is free to rotate, otherwise the pins halt its rotation by, well, being a solid object wedged between a moving bit and a non-moving bit.</p>
<p>The trick is that, if you imagine each pin stack as a single pin that has been cut at some point along its length, each one is a different length; on their own, the pins are all long enough so that even when fully pressed in/springs fully compressed, they won't go all the way into the housing, some will still be in the cylinder stopping the mechanism, and so the only way to get the lock to turn is to align the pins correctly.</p>
<p>If you imagine that each pin has 10 possible points for a shear line, and a lock has 5 pins in it, then you essentially get (pardon the pun) security on par with the PIN for your debit card: a number of a set length that is hard to guess, but not unique.</p>
<p>The end result is that if you take your house key and try it on about 100,000 different locks from the same manufacturer, your key is very likely to open at least one of the other locks. But it is very <em>un</em>likely (but not impossible) that your key will unlock the door of anyone within a block or two of you. Just like if all PINs were truly random (which, they aren't, but that's another story), and you had several tens of thousands of cards to try, one would eventually have the same PIN as yours, but most of us only interact with a handfull of debit cards other than our own in our lifetime.</p>
<p>EDIT: number of pin stacks; 5 is common, but they can be anywhere from 4-6 typically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
