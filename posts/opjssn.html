		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;Normal&quot; PCR test for COVID-19 targets regions of the DNA that we believe are likely to be &quot;highly conserved&quot; ie not likely to mutate.  This has allowed us to build tests looking at things like ORF and N-Gene to identify whether what we found up your nose was in fact COVID.  Once we have a confirmed positive for a sample the remainder of the Viral Transport Medium from the swab gets split up, some is sent for sequencing and any remainder for Variant of Concern (VoC) testing.</p>
<p>VoC testing is PCR tests that target the actual mutations that exist in the variants.  As an example we could look for Delta by determining whether P681R is mutant (sample is Delta) or wild type (sample is not)</p>
<p>We can either run multiple simple PCR's one for each mutation and asses the results overall or we can run a multiplex that allows us to make our assesment off a single reaction (both methods come with their own benefits).</p>
<p>VoC testing is basically a way of getting a quick answer whilst genotyping gives us a slower but more details response.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It took a bit, but eventually  each test went through sequencing to figure out what variant of the virus it is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So essentially the RNA of the variants will be mostly identical. It will have conserved regions that are essential to it's function and what make it a covid, other regions will be varied and allow it to adapt to new environments and evolve quickly. The PCR test usually looks for around 20-30 bases from within a conserved region. To be confirmed the test will have to pick up three or more of these regions.</p>
<p>To actually find out what variant you have you have to do genotyping which is like a more complicated PCR that only looks for know variation. It's quite simple but you have to know what you are looking for first.</p>
<p>To discover a new variant you have to sequence a ton of samples and use computers to analyse them for patterns of variation. You can get natural variation (like all humans looking different) but when the variation become a common trait (blonde hair) you get a variant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
