		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with sleep cycles. Your body is used to a certain amount of rem sleep per night. If you have reached this amount your sleep gets lighter and you wake up. If you force yourself to sleep longer than that your body enters a new rem sleep cycle, which you then can’t complete. If you haven’t completed a rem sleep cycle you feel tired.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I remember learning in biology, you go through different sleep cycles each night and youre only in REM for very small amounts of that time. You essentially cycle through these stages. Depending on which part of the stage you wake up in, you'll either feel refreshed or groggy. This is why using those sleep apps help with waking up at the correct time because there is less movement during REM (when you shouldn't be waking up) and more movement when you are coming out of REM (when it would be better to wake up). These alarms gradually wake you  up as your movement increases whereas a traditional alarm wakes you up at any random period of the sleep cycle. I've used Apple's native one &quot;bedtime&quot; and another one I bought on the app store before apple's and they both work the same: I never wake up during REM any more, never wake up feeling tired regardless if its 4AM or 7AM. I always feel like I got a full 8 hours. Try it!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a NASCAR circuit that your brain laps on when you're sleeping. There is just one way in or out of the track though.</p>
<p>In hopeful normal circumstances, you'll wake up when your brain is nearing that gateway after a few complete laps.</p>
<p>If you let yourself add a few extra laps up but life decides to shut down the track when your brain is far from that single gate, it will have to drag itself all the way there and that's not pleasant nor fun.</p>
<p>Basically, that's a sleep cycle. When you complete a lap you get some plentiful restorative rest. There are around 5 laps in a good 7-9h of natural sleep, varying from person to person. If you overshoot or undershoot it when you're in the middle of one of the deeper sleep stages, there's a lot of sleep thingies in your body that needs to be cleared up before you feel actually alert and awake.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: 5 laps, not 3.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mental health counselor here! A normative sleep cycle involves going through different stages throughout the night (albeit different ages account for slightly different cycles). During this cycle, there is a more effective or optimal stage to wake up in (usually a lighter sleep stage being best). When we sleep too much, we may wake up in a non-optimal stage (such as REM or deep sleep) making us feel more tired.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
