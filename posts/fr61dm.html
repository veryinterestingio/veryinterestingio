		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of these answers are very good and detailed, but not ELI5. Let me try:</p>
<p>If you eat plants, only the plants need to be grown. If you eat meat, plants need to be grown, the animals eat them, then we eat the animals. Lots of energy is lost this way, and much more land is used than if we just ate plants. People cut down lots of trees to make room for the animals we eat. Then their poop makes the water dirty.</p>
<p>Edit: wow, thanks for my first gold!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR Carbon emissions, deforestation, water usage, water contamination, decreased biodiversity, leeching top soil nutrients, pesticide and herbicide use, GMO genes spreading to wild plants</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Raising livestock in the way that many countries do is a very carbon emitting process. For example, if Americans switch from eating beef (not all meat, just beef) to eating beans, America could reach 50-75% of our carbon emissions goals for 2020.</p>
<p>Cattle farming is responsible for 71% of deforestation in Latin America. So in addition to creating a ton of carbon, it is also causing the loss of our carbon sinks, further exacerbating green house gas collection in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Though meat is only 18% of our calories, it utilizes 83% of our farmland for raising the livestock as well as their food. Not to mention how much water these farmlands require.</p>
<p>The immense amount of waste/manure that these factory farms produce has polluted ground water as well as local fresh water sources in many areas. This has led to dead zones which further decreases biodiversity in areas that are not being used for farmland.</p>
<p>Our tendency for monoculture crop is destroying the top soil and not returning valuable nutrients which lead to unusable land if we do not drastically change our farming practices.</p>
<p>If we do not change our farming practices, we may not be able to grow ANYTHING in less than 60 years due to soil degradation.</p>
<p>Many crops are GMO to increase hardiness and decrease susceptibility to pesticides and herbicides. Therefore, many farmers use a lot of these types of chemicals to increase their yields. These are also polluting our waterways. Additionally, nature does her own thing, so there has been gene crossover leading to wild plants, including invasive and destructive species, that have these genes but are now immune to herbicides which further decreases biodiversity as these plants overtake even non-agricultural spaces.</p>
<p>Since you specifically asked about how eating meat is bad for the environment, I will not go into all the reasons it is bad for personal and collective health of humans as well as our economies.</p>

<p>If you have Hulu, the documentary <em>The Biggest Little Farm</em> shows a great way how sustainable farming can be done.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The meat from one chicken can feed a human for maybe a day if that's all you eat.  All the food that was fed to that chicken over it's entire life could feed a human for several weeks.  It's very inefficient to grow food to feed the chicken and then eat the chicken.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is just thermodynamics. It takes around 5kg of plant material to make 1kg of beef, so you might as well just eat the 5kg of plant material yourself and cut out the middle-man.</p>
<p>Additionally, meat-production is notoriously terrible for the environment, as huge swaths of valuable ecosystems (like the Amazon Rain-forest) must be cleared to make room for grazing fields <strong>and</strong> plantations for animal-feed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Entropy. You never get as much back from the conversion of energy as you put in to convert it. In the case of chemical energy in the form of food, the higher up the food chain you go, the less efficient and more wasteful things get. </p>
<p>All of our food started as sunlight. Plants turn sunlight into carbohydrates, fat, and protein, and animals eat these things and they form the basis of our food chain. </p>
<p>The amount of calories it takes to raise an animal is far more than the amount of calories you will ever get from it's meat. In addition to that, the animal also requires land and water, it's own food supply, and something has to be done with it's waste products. If you cut out the animal and go directly to the plant for food, you greatly reduce the need for more land, water, and waste management. </p>
<p>In short, instead of the diminishing returns you get the higher up the food chain you go, eating plants is less wasteful because the chemical energy that started as sunlight is used directly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
