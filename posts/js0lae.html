		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While doing just a quick fly over on Google Earth of the Canadian province of Quebec, it is quite easy to spot the preponderance of almost perfectly circular lakes dotted around. If they are named, like lake Manicougan, it says that it is an Annular lake that was formed by an asteroid impact at some point in the Triassic period.</p>
<p>I am assuming asteroids throughout the history of Earth didn't have a bias to strike in areas that would become modern day Quebec, so I would guess the rest of the Earth has been bombarded to a similar degree as the preponderance of these lakes in Quebec. But why has Quebec in particular and maybe a few other places on Earth preserved these scars so well while they have vanished everywhere else?</p></div></div>

<p>Both of those examples are impact craters, but these are a very unusual form of lake; surface craters aren't common on our planet because erosion is so active, and tectonics rebuilds our crust over geological timescales.</p>
<p>Most of the circular ponds in Canada (and other tundra and former glaciated regions) are in fact Kettle ponds <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kettle_(landform" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kettle_(landform</a>).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two things may provide an explanation. First there are a lot of circular lakes in the area, because there are a lot of lakes in the area. Some of this is confirmation bias. Because there are around a million lakes in Quebec, it's no surprise that many happen to be nearly circular even if not all were created by impacts.</p>
<p>That said, there are several impact craters and it would seem to be a disproportionately large number of them. This is likely due to the underlying geology of the Canadian Shield. It's composed of rather hard igneous and metamorphic rocks which resist erosion, and maintain the shape of craters which would likely erode away much faster in softer substrates. It's also a very old piece of earth's crust with portions being nearly four billion years old. This leaves a long time span for impact craters to be observed where in other locations, mountain building, volcanism, subduction, seafloor spreading, or other factors would erase the record of older craters leaving comparably few intact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If I am not mistaken, they did not anticipated that it would take that shape and later discovered that it was due to a meteor crater.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At least some of it is because the province of Quebec has some of the oldest stone in the world. It shows a lot of wear and tear from over the years because it's had an awful lot of time to accumulate those scars. In addition, there's a lot of lakes in the area. The same processes that would normally fill in lowlands and lakes will readily fill impact craters too.</p>
<p>In fact, the Clearwater Lakes are two impact craters that are almost right on top of each other, separated in time by an estimated \~200 million years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like kettle holes. Glacial deposits that half sit under the soils and when they melt, leave a depression. Overtime peat moss has filled and died and filled and died and allowed sedges, trees and other things to move in and build up bottoms.</p>
<p>Not in Canada, but here in central PA we have Bear Meadow Run which is a stream that runs through a peat moss filled and built up kettle pond and has some black spruce which is rare for us here and is from the last glacial period. The bog is so full you can walk on it, bears do to get highbush blueberry in there. You might sink in a hole up to your knee but you can catch yourself. But you can see the stream and thatâ€™s it with a big island with wild orchids in areas of fire dosturbance</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
