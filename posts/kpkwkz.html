<p>It’s my understanding that the first dose (of the Pfizer vaccine) is 52% effective at preventing COVID and the second is 95% effective. So what happens if you are exposed to COVID and contract it in the 21/28 days between doses? In the trials, did those participants get the second dose? Did they get it while infectious or after recovering? Or were they removed from the study? </p>
<p>Asking because I just received the Moderna vaccine a few days ago and I want to know what would happen if I were to get it from one of my patients during the limbo period between doses. Thanks!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually happening quite a bit out there, though many had the exposure prior to their first dose but were not aware until afterwards. In practice, we will be giving the 2nd dose once they have completed isolation and cleared the acute infection. However, in general, we are trying to wait 90 days from a positive to start the vaccine. Both because you generally don't vaccinate people who are acutely ill and because people are immune for at least 90 days anyway. Here's what CDC said 4 days ago about the timing of 2nd doses: </p>
<p>&quot;Second doses administered within a grace period of ≤4 days from the recommended date for the second dose are considered valid; however, doses administered earlier do not need to be repeated. The second dose should be administered as close to the recommended interval as possible. However, there is no maximum interval between the first and second dose for either vaccine.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The actual protective effect is much more than 52%, but likely takes about 10 days to kick in, so the cases until that point in the trial (many of which were probably incubating prior to the first dose being administered) skew the percentage. I made an Imgur account just so I could show you this, because I think it will explain better than words can:</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/VP0kWas" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/gallery/VP0kWas</a></p>
<p>That’s the graph from the trial. Note that these are cases after the <em>first</em> dose in the two separate trial arms, vaccine and placebo. After about 10 days out from dose 1, you can see the significant protective effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The 100% facts of this is unknown still and likely variable between person to person. Depending upon where they're at in seroconversion/if they ever seroconverted and their immune response status.</p>
<p>The working theory right now is that an infection could act as a mimic for the second dose. Since the first is to prime and the second vaccine is to precipitate full immunity status(even if temporary) and the second actual exposure with a covid infection could do this. However, this is assuming a lot of things...</p>
<p>1-you seroconverted the first time 2-your body is now able to detect the actual virus and healthy enough to generate an immune response 3-that immune response is lasting and not temporary. -True for vaccines too. We just don't know.</p>
<p>The only concerning thing is this: you could be educating the virus that if it has a spike protein(the one the vaccine focuses on) it cannot as adequately infect, so its more likely to mutate genetically away from that protein variant. Potentially educating the virus and slowly making the vaccine absolutely ineffective.  If this happens there will be even more push back from the anti-vax crowd. So its really important we all do our part to actually give the vaccine a fighting chance. IE-social distancing where we can even after vaccination, mask wearing, and keeping the covid circles super small.</p>
<p>-I used to be a genetic scientist and design vaccines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
