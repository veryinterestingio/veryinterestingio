		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You may notice that domains end in stuff like .com<br />
or .uk  or something like that.<br />
Each different way of ending is called a  top-level domain (TLD).<br />
TLDs are usually run by an organization.<br />
Often it's run by a government or a government owned corporation for something like a .uk domain.
Or a company that manages internet stuff like Verisign (they own .com and .net and a whole lot of other very common internet things)  </p>
<p>These companies almost always made a deal with several companies like GoDaddy so they do a lot of the grunt work with managing who gets what name, while they act as the authority to confirm that there isn't any conflict and do the work to get it online.<br />
So you pay GoDaddy, GoDaddy does a lot of the work sorting it out and pays that TLD, TLD does a lot of other work behind the scene.  </p>
<p>All of them made an agreement that if there was a real big dispute, they would let the courts handle it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of domains like like phone numbers. You rent your phone number from your phone company, usually by way of a yearly contract. If you stop paying your bill, your number will get disconnected and after a while the phone company can issue that number to someone else.</p>
<p>The same is true of domain names, you just rent these for as long as you keep paying the bill.</p>
<p>Like phone numbers, governments usually set up the system and then let others manage the day to day running of that system.</p>
<p>In this analogy, the government say that there can be telephone numbers beginning with 01, 0800, 07 etc. but then telephone companies are responsible for leasing these numbers to customers.</p>
<p>With domains, Nominet are in charge of all .uk domain names but generally companies like Godaddy sit between you, the customer, and Nominet. If you want to register thisismydomain.co.uk you go to Godaddy, they tell you how to much to pay to lease the domain for a year, you pay and then they register the domain, in your name, with Nominet.</p>
<p>Domain providers can, as far as I am aware, charge what they like to register and renew domains.</p>
<p>If a domain has already been registered, it can not be leased to someone else unless the original registrar does not renew it after the lease expires. After the domain expires, it is usually locked for 90 days so that it does not work (any web site or email addresses attached to it will not function properly) and can only be renewed by the person who originally leased it. After 90 days the domain goes back on the open market for anyone to register.</p>
<p>Time lines vary for different domain extensions e.g. .com, .co.uk etc but thatâ€™s essentially how the system works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A fundamental concept about the Domain Name System (DNS) is that the <em>protocol</em> is not owned by <em>anyone</em>. Same way the concept of the entire English language isn't owned by anyone, etc. DNS <em>as a protocol</em> is, in a thick nutshell, just a big fancy list that pair human-readable names (web domain addresses) to machine-usable names (IP addresses), and a bunch of rules that dictate the chain of command of whose list you can trust when you have multiple machines. To break that down a a bit... when you type &quot;reddit.com&quot; into the browser of a computer that has never been to that website before, it doesn't know where the server with that webpage is at. It needs an IP address, not a wordy name. So it asks a computer it trusts if it knows where to find it. If that computer doesn't know, it can ask a computer it trusts to know. And so on, and so forth, until you get to the computer that literally wrote the rule for it. This chain of command and the way computers ask each other like this is the DNS.</p>
<p>The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is, at this time, the entity that gets to decide who owns what website, as they are also the overseers of the world's largest DNS network via their subsidiary, the (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority). If you want a website to point to the IP address for your server for everyone who looks up that address with ICANN's DNS system (which is almost everyone), you basically need to ask them permission. They need to voluntarily update their system so that everyone who comes knocking asking for the IP address to &quot;yourcooldomainwebsite.whatever&quot; will be told to go to your server's IP address. How do you do that? You pay them. Costs a lot of money to basically run the public Internet, gotta fund it somehow. Except, you probably won't pay them directly. You will likely be going through a domain registrar like GoDaddy, who acts as a middleman wholesaler. Why do these places exist? Because ICANN can't reasonably handle listening to every little request to buy a web domain around the entire planet, so they delegate that job to wholesalers.</p>
<p>A big key word in that description of ICANN is that they own the <em>largest</em> DNS network. They don't &quot;own&quot; DNS any more than Merriam Webster &quot;owns&quot; English. You can actually choose to trust whoever you want to feed you DNS information. It's merely that basically every device, operating system, and piece of software that has the ability to choose who it trusts tends to come pre-assumed to trust ICANN for this information. You don't <em>have</em> to trust ICANN. I mean, there's a huge laundry list of reason why you probably <em>should</em>, but you don't <em>have</em> to. You can trust whoever you want. And whoever is the root of the system you end up trusting is effectively in charge of that big list of who owns what website.</p>
<p>The point in me bringing this up is that the question was asked in the context of &quot;What gives whoever is on top <em>the right</em> to charge for owning a web domain?&quot; The simple answer to that, is that the system we live and work in is bathed in a general assumption that ICANN (or anyone who preceded them) was in control from the beginning. When you buy a new Windows PC, for example, it comes preinstalled with a list of certificates it trusts, signed through some chain of command back up to ICANN. Whenever you connect to a network, and you ask the local DNS authority to tell you what's what, you basically assume that authority has some chain of command back to ICANN. And if you don't trust them, you can verify it for yourself, and it will pretty much always be the case. So, ICANN has the authority to charge because... well, we let them do it. Nothing is stopping anyone from throwing their hands up in the air and starting their own root DNS authority. There are already <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_DNS_root#Alternative_DNS_providers" target="_blank">a few relatively notable alternatives</a>. But good luck getting anyone to use (and more importantly, <em>trust</em>) you to keep it running, and keep it running better than ICANN. You either play by ICANN's rules to get into their system, or you toss away your access to the overwhelming majority of people who trust ICANN to tell them where websites are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
