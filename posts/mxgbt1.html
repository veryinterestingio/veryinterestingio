		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Thinking&quot; is a mix of electrical activity and chemical interactions in the brain. Being horny is just the right mix of hormones to persuade you to procreate (the driving force behind life). The high you get from sex encourages you to do it more, and so it builds as you do it (aka hormone concentrations change) but once you are done, there is no need for encouragement anymore, so the hormone mix changes drastically, which in turn changes your thought processes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you haven't eaten for several days. You're starving. You're constantly scanning for food. It is driving most of your actions, concious and unconcious. Then you smell barbecue. You follow your nose and you see it. There's a styrofoam container with some ribs in it just sitting there. There's nobody around, so you dive right in. After plowing your way through it you lick your lips with a satisfied smile and look around. Now that you don't have tunnel vision focused completely on the food since the all-consuming urge to eat is gone you realize that maybe eating someone discarded leftovers that were sitting in a trash bin is not quite the reason for celebration you initially thought.  </p>
<p>Hunger, thirst, and procreation are the core motivators of all life. Concious thought and behavior is a layer on top of these prime unconcious motivators and associated behaviors and can be lost in the noise like trying to listen to and focus on your podcast when your three kids are screaming at you. Kick the screaming kids outside, and your focus snaps back. Maybe you realize you said some harsh words to them in the moment that you now regret. Your emotional state is, to a large degree, a product of chemicals in your brain that are released based on outside stimulus, and the triggered memories, both unconcious and concious, that make up our mental state.  </p>
