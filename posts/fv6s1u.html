		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's no reason an adult couldn't wake up and be ready for action too. It's just that the life of a child is all about entertainment - a child wakes up and the only things it thinks about are whatever it wants to do right now - ie, something entertaining. This desire to do something fun overpowers any brief muscle stiffness or brain haziness. When an adult wakes up, it tends to think about all the bad parts of being an adult, which is a really demotivating thing to think about. With no desire to get up because if they get up they have to do boring adult things, the adult brain pays considerably more attention to all the minor aches and pains and by paying more attention to them makes you think they're bigger than they really are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;Throughout adult life, dopamine levels fall by up to 10% every decade. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot; ... anger (high arousal) decreased with age, while sadness (low arousal) remained stable, and suggested that both positive and negative high arousal emotions will decline over the lifespan.&quot;</p>
<p>High positive: Interest</p>
<p>Low negative: Contentment</p>
<p>High negative: Frustration</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All things being equal, healthy sleep cycles and no sleeping disorders, children wake up just as groggy as adults. It takes a moment for any brain to boot up.
The thing that makes it seem like kids are ready to move the moment they get up is the difference between adult sleep cycles and child sleep cycles. Children usually go to bed much earlier than adults, and while children do require more sleep than adults, when a child goes to bed at 8 and an adult goes to bed at 11 there's going to be a big difference in when they wake up. So while an adult will still be sleeping as part of their sleep cycle, a child will have already ended their sleep cycle and had a chance to wake up and get moving. And when the adult wakes up and is still getting moving, the child is already an hour into their day and is ready for food, toys, and disney+.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
