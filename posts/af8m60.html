		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I live in Scotland which is super barren as a result of human activity some few hundred years ago. I was wondering what, if any, effects on the local climate would have an extensive afforestation of the region? Making the place less windy would be probably one of the effects, but would it be also likely to alter the temperature much? What about precipitation? How extensive would the afforestation be for the effects to be measurable?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physical geographer here. The changes would be much smaller in Scotland compared to the tropics. Precipitation is entirely driven by the westerlies transporting moist air to you. However, runoff would decrease because trees increase what's called evapotranspiration, which would mean reduced risk of flooding. I don't remember the numbers but it's in the general area of 10-15%, which is a lot.</p>
<p>Temperatures would become more stable and generally slightly cooler, but probably just a few degrees.</p>
<p>You also have to remember that the effects are mostly local (except runoff ofc. which is important for everything downstream), on the order of kilometers I think.</p>
<p>By far the most important benefit of reforestation would be ecological as the heathlands are extremely poor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
