		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Atherosclerotic plaques are made of a lot more than just fat. Immune cells, platlets, the endothelium (inner cellular  lining of blood vessel) all contribute to the plaque build up (physical blockage and chemical signaling). That environment creates a local pocket of inflammation and  screwed up cell signaling which results in those cells taking up excess fat and calcifying it. The calcified fat is the real problem that the body cannot readily deal with, nor do we have good therapeutics for it. While healthy dieting and regular exercise can improve the plaque, it is not 100% reversible. Surgically, we can use angioplasty to widen the plaque to improve blood flow to a tissue - very common treatment for coronary artery disease.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot of misconception about the physical &quot;appearance&quot; of arterial plaque (aka Atherosclerosis). Most people visualize arterial plaque buildup in arteries as gunk (e.g. cholesterol) getting stuck along the lining a pipe (e.g. blood vessels). </p>
<p>In reality, the buildup happens in-between the lining of the artery and the wall of the artery. The build-up also isn't just the slow deposit of cholesterol along a pipe, but a very complex, slow inflammatory process that starts with the fat breaching your artery wall and your body responding by attacking it, the result which is the plaque (note this is a significant oversimplification). This is why we can't just &quot;scrape&quot; off plaque from our arteries. Google image search &quot;arterial plaque&quot; to get a more accurate visualization. While the focus is on prevention, as other posters have noted, there are some new therapies that may help reduce the buildup and see an improvement in bloodflow of affected arteries.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a near impossible concept to study. What our best guesses suggest is that the answer is both “maybe” and “it might not matter”. </p>
<p>Arterial plaques are somewhat complex and are certainly not all created equal (some are acute and softer, some have taken years to develop and are calcified and basically a scar) . I have anecdotally seen during my time in the cardiac cath lab patients whose coronary arteries seem to magically improve over a number of years with medical management (aspirin, cholesterol lowering drugs, and blood pressure and diabetes control) along with smoking cessation, weight loss, exercise.</p>
<p>Patients who have documented disease along with doing the above are statistically shown to live longer and have a longer time to progression of vascular disease. Reversibility of the physical plaque, on the other hand, is a trickier concept to claim either way.</p>
<p>All being said, I’m just a 4th year med student and not an expert expert.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
