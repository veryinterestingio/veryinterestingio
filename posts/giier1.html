		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The same way we test any other pressure sealed system, raging from big tankers to tanks, to the gas pipe systems. Every valve and opening is sealed, then we pressurise the system, if the pressure doesn't drop then it is sealed.  </p>
<p>Once they close the door to the spacecraft, they can pressurise it and check whether the pressure stays stable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>NASA engineer here. First, only manned spacecraft are sealed. Robotic spacecraft are purposely vented. This reduces the structural loads and lightens the primary structure. But it means that all your electronics must be tested at vacuum and it impacts thermal designs. (Except for the Russians, they just seal all the electronics in a big, pressurized vault. They pay on mass-to-orbit, but it simplifies ground testing.)  </p>
<p>For manned missions, during design and preliminary testing, you just pressurize the vessel with the same pressure drop from inside to outside. e.g. Say your spacecraft is designed to operate at 4.3PSI (the operating pressure of a NASA space suit), but you're at sea level with an ambient pressure of 14.4PSI. You just pressurize the suit to 18.7PSI to test. However, at 4.3PSI, you'll be running the suit at 100% oxygen. This is where Apollo 1 ran into an issue. They pressurized the capsule to 16.7PSI, but at 100% Oxygen for a ground test. At those oxygen levels, things that normally smolder, burn rapidly. Things that normally burn, explode. The Apollo program completely overhauled their atmosphere management after that accident.</p>
<p>Let me know if you want to learn a bit more (like how astronauts can get the bends if they're not careful going out on spacewalks, perhaps).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cool thing here is NASA actually tells us exactly how they do all their testing. Because they work for the public they tell us how they do testing in details in papers for free on the internet. They may use a giant vacuum chamber with heaters and chillers to make it like space. Or they may create custom setups to make the difference inside and out about the same as space. They will do this hot and cold, over and over. That is called environmental testing. They will make the temperatures more extreme and the vacuum stronger during testing than real life. That is called a safety factor. </p>
<p>Basically everything leaks. It may not leak fast. In fact it may leak so slow that air doesnâ€™t really leak out fast enough to measure. So they use helium gas to look for leaks. Helium is a really tiny molecule that is specially good at escaping. Then detectors will see how much helium is leaking. NASA will have rules for how much leaking is Ok. None would be great but when it comes to helium and doors that open and close in space there may be some. And that is find. </p>

<p>For reference if you want to read more here is a document on designing their hatches used: </p>

<p>And here are some testing standards: </p>

<p>TlDr; NASA uses a camber or other setup to produce vacuum a little stronger than space. They also include heat and cold. Inside they put helium because it gets our easier than air. Outside they check for how much helium gets out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
