		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine the soundwave/shockwave of thunder like an invisible cylinder around the lightning you just saw. That cylinder is created at the moment you see lightning, and it grows in radius at the speed of sound (approx. 300m/s). Now on the surface of that cylinder there are one thousand of tiny little surfers, each of the surfing in their own direction away from the lightning, and whenever a surfer collides with your ear, you hear a noise.</p>
<p>Now, as the cylinder grows, all of the surfers naturally surf away from each other, and all the surfers grow further and further apart (or less and less energy per surface area). The less surfers reach your ear, the more quiet the thunder.</p>
<p>The duration of thunder is a little bit harder to imagine. Again, a thousand surfers riding the shockwave. In their path from the lightning outwards, some of the surfers hit rigid objects like walls, houses, rocks, or trees. These rigid surfaces reflect them away from their original path. But if they cross a city, they don't only hit one house, but many. They end up on sort of a crazy random walk through the city, reflected hundreds to thousands of times. But in the end they may still end up in someones ear, and that person can again hear a tiny noise.</p>
<p>Now as I said there a thousands of surfers, and all of them are randomly reflected a different number of times, so they take a different amount of time until they can be heard. Hence the once short, loud bang (many surfers arriving all at the same time) became a long, less loud rumble (many surfers all arriving one after another).</p>
<p>Edit: Gold? For a bunch of surfers? Thank you kind stranger!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m not an expert, just a storm-lover and wanna be storm photographer. Can I add that if this topic is of interest to you, I HIGHLY recommend checking out <a href="https://www.lightningmaps.org/" target="_blank">https://www.lightningmaps.org/</a>.  This is a fascinating way to enjoy a storm happening in your area, and it has a feature that shows the thunder sound front (or cylinder, to use the same verbiage as the previous poster) in <em>REAL TIME.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The amount of air displaced, and your distance relative to the initial strike. </p>
<p>Lightning is so incredibly high voltage / heat intensive that it causes a sort of high pressure tube of super heated air. The air then rapidly expands outward. </p>
<p>From 10-40,000 feet up, is how far lightning can travel. Even higher in some cases. That is an incredible distance, even just over 10,560 feet is two miles up into the atmosphere. So you’re talking about a lot of molecules that get pushed around in the disturbance. </p>
<p>The sound wave traveling out that we perceive as thunder is that movement of air. </p>
<p>Now, your distance from the initial strike is important because sound travels in waves. Even one cubic foot of air displacement is audible to you. If you’ve ever been near one of those snapping glass domed Tesla coils, you’ve heard electricity in action. Just think about how loud it would be near the source of a strike thats 6 miles long!!? </p>
<p>People have had their eardrums ruptured from less.</p>
<p>The wave form of the sound that you hear, follows the arc and path of the lightning, (Interestingly this also causes thunder to make that peal like effect.) </p>
<p>Thats why when you see lightning you can count before you hear thunder and it will give you a relative distance to the strike. (A game children learn to know when it’s safe to be outside during storms.) </p>
<p>As for full volume of it, volume decreases over distance. More air shifting in the path of the wave and echos bouncing back and around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Remember too, that lightning doesn't travel straight up and down, it can travel for miles horizontally, so if it travels 5 miles horizontally from the cloud, sound from the top of the bolt will hit your ear more than 22 seconds after sound from near the ground, assuming the top of the bolt is further away, and the strike is the closest point to you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
