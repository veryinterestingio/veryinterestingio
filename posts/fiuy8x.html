Would they be on life support indefinitely or would anyone have the authority to ‘pull the plug’ so to speak? Sorry it’s kind of a dark question but these are the kinds of things keeping me up at night haha.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hospitals have a medical ethics committee that would come in and make that decision. Pulling the plug, essentially removing the patient from a mechanical ventilator, is often seen as essentially allowing someone to pass away. Going a bit further, oftentimes it also means removal of life sustaining drugs for supporting adequate blood pressure and/or basic bodily functions (i.e., nutrition, electrolytes, blood products). I’ve seen patients die almost immediately, and I’ve seen patients linger for days once the ventilator is pulled. It’s always a weird situation for all bedside attendees, but the medical ethics committee essentially steps in when there is 0.00 quality or chance of life once care is removed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is something called Two Doc, which can force a consent if a patient is unable to consent and has no available family. Think stroke or major accident where the patient is not physically or cognitively able to give consent. The physicians must be acting in the best interest of the patient and go with standard or best practice treatment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the UK the consultant in charge of the patient will make the decisions re care and can decide to stop treatment if they think it is in the patients best interest. </p>
<p>In fact we can over rule families if we think that the family are causing the patient harm and not acting in their interest although this very rarely happens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a member of my facility’s ethics committee, I can say that we will perform an exhaustive search for family. After that of money are found, we look for someone who knows the person and would have their best interests at heart. If we can find absolutely nobody, then, at least in the stat of California, we as a committee are able to decide for the patient what a reasonably prudent person would decide in that situation, keeping in mind the ethical principles of beneficence and non-malefiscence which are to “do good” and to “do no harm”. In my experience of patients in a comatose condition in full life support, we will be consulted after about a week and a half in order to determine the goals of care and code status.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
