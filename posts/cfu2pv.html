<p>But then you lose all the advantages of having networked computers. It slows things down. Now if you need information from another department, you have to get it the old fashioned way, sneaker-net style.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some agencies do sensitive work on 'air-gapped' systems that are not connected to external networks. Security levels vary by agency, from 'no public Internet access' to 'no outside networks, ever, period'. Theoretically, this makes those environments less hackable.</p>
<p>I have walked OS patches on CD-ROM (NOT CD-RW) into secure facilities a few times, when I've been searched for USB sticks and cell phones and watched closely by staff with blinking red lights overhead telling everyone that I'm a potential threat. Never mind the fact that I'm the guy that built the OS patch - and if anyone was capable of doing something bad as the root user, it would be me.</p>
<p>tl;dr - it's all about expense, and your paranoia level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Security is often a trade off between safety and useability (as well as cost of course). In particular,  air gapped systems have severe disadvantages precisely because they are disconnected. Looking up public information, interacting with your community of peers, emails, etc. is all made more difficult. </p>
<p>The increased security of air gapped systems is only worth it in certain circumstances. Companies usually hope their other security measures (firewalls, encryption of files, etc.) are good enough to not be victims of untargeted attacks (most normal worms and viruses that live in the &quot;wild&quot;). This is the case for most small and medium business enterprises and perhaps some multinationals. </p>
<p>Organisations who feel at risk of targeted attacks (some branches of government, law enforcement, defense contractors, perhaps some firms with a lot of high value industry secrets) can and do take more security measures, including air gapped systems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most companies have air gaped networks, for their most sensitive work.  The US government operates a [huge one](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIPRNet" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIPRNet</a> ).  </p>
<p>It's a lot of extra work.  Employees complain that it reduces their productivity when they can't watch cat videos.  For many companies, their &quot;sensitive work&quot; isn't worth it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>But if you need to share information between two computers, there would be an internet connection. Emails can always be hacked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
