<p>Because after that the expansion of space is noticeable, would photon be farther than 1 billion light years after 1 billion years?</p>
<p>Does the expansion of space (Hubble flow) carry the photon forward?</p></div></div>

But, due to expansion of space both ahead and behind it, if you took two points in space that were 1 billion light years apart at the beginning of the photon's journey, and start the photon at one of them heading toward the other, then the photon would not have reached the other object, and would also be more than 1 billion light years away from the initial object.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The <em>physical distance</em> for a photon which travels for 1 year is 1 lightyear, but the distance in co-moving coordinates (&quot;co-moving&quot; with the expansion of space) will be smaller.</p>
<p>The physical distance (x) is related to the distance in co-moving coordinates (r) by x = a(t) r. So the infinitesimal physical distance is dx = a(t) dr. In an expanding universe, a(t) is an increasing function.</p>
<p>From the FLRW metric, for a null geodesic we have dx = c dt. Then combining this with the relationship between x and r, we have that dr = (c/a(t)) dt. The total co-moving distance traveled then is just the integral of (c/a(t)) dt between the initial and final times. And the coordinates are scaled such that a(now) = 1, and a(t) is an increasing function. So if the photon leaves from some distant point &quot;now&quot;, then by the time it gets here, a(t) will be greater than 1. In other words, the physical distances between points will be larger than they were when the photon left.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A photon would travel exactly one billion light years in one billion years.</p>
<p>At the same time after a billion years, the photon would not yet reach the point that was one billion light years away when departing.</p>
<p>Finally, the photon would also be more than a billion light years away from the origin after a billion years.</p>
<p>The thing with traveling through expanding universe is that only distances scale up over time, while everything else remains the same. A great analog of that would be a balloon if you are taking a picture of it, you can małe it bigger by zooming in (this is what would happen if everything would scale up with space) or you can blow more air into it (this is expansion). If our 1 billion years of a photon flight would be represented by a &quot;1 billion light years&quot; long string, in the first case you could still stretch the string between the same two spots on the balloon, but if you blow more air and expand the balloon, the string wił no longer be long enough.</p>
<p>Now to your original question: your photon &quot;string&quot; is not attached to any of the points on the balloon, but for a lack of better analog, it's more like tied to the middle point than any of the ends. The photon path after all that time is still 1 billion light years long, despite the origin being further away than originally and the destination being further away than it was at the moment of departure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
