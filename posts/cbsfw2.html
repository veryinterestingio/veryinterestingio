		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, the paper that originally found this was published in 2008 here: <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00439-007-0460-x" target="_blank">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00439-007-0460-x</a></p>
<p>It found that blue eye color in Europe and the Near East was due to a mutation in a region of DNA that regulates the OCA2 gene. Since the same mutation was present in all the blue-eyed people they studied, and since the surrounding DNA (&quot;haplotype&quot;) was also the same, this implies that the mutation occurred in a common ancestor. From the paper's abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One single haplotype, represented by six polymorphic SNPs covering half of the 3â€² end of the HERC2 gene, was found in 155 blue-eyed individuals from Denmark, and in 5 and 2 blue-eyed individuals from Turkey and Jordan, respectively. Hence, our data suggest a common founder mutation in an OCA2 inhibiting regulatory element as the cause of blue eye color in humans. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since 2008, more research has been done on eye color genetics, especially regarding non-European populations (which in general have different genetic variants, not just for eye color). I'll edit this post with a summary once I read some papers.</p>
<p>EDIT: It seems that subsequent research has identified additional genetic variants that can result in blue eye color. SNPedia has a good overview (<a href="https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Eye_color" target="_blank">https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Eye_color</a>) and also this 2012 review article on OCA2 variants (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3325407/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3325407/</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We report that the blue-eye associated alleles at all three haplotypes were found at high frequencies in Europe; however, one is restricted to Europe and surrounding regions, while the other two are found at moderate to high frequencies throughout the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, additional research has shown that there are not one but at least three different genetic variants that can cause blue eyes. This means that not every blue-eyed person is descended from the same ancestor (although within certain European populations it's still pretty likely).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the mutation did happen multiple times. For example, there is a population on the Solomon Islands who have dark skin but sometimes have blue eyes and blond hair. It is genetically distinct from the European kind, also looks pretty cool.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While this doesn't answer the question directly (/u/-Metacelsus- did that nicely) I'd like to adress the aspect of &quot;how can a single common ancestor be responsible for <em>all</em> the blue eyes in the world?&quot;</p>
<p>That's because we are all related to each other. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm0hOex4psA" target="_blank">This video</a> explains the math but essentially, if you go back far enough in history then everyone alive then is either related to everyone alive today or their family line died out completely. And the amazing thing is that you don't have to go that far back in history at all. If you're of European descent then with enough work you're pretty much guaranteed to be able to trace your family lineage back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne" target="_blank">Charlemange</a>. And that's not because he was some kind of prolific breeder. You are probably related to pretty much everyone from that time (who's family line didn't die out). It's just a whole lot easier to find documents about Charlemagne than some no name farmer out in bumfuck nowhere.</p>
<p>And this is a mere 1300 years ago. According to simulations based on migration patterns and population growths the corresponding generation that is related to everybody alive <em>in the world</em> today would be somewhere between 4000-7000 years ago. That is more than enough time for a gene that's considered to be 10k years old to account for every pair of blue eyes in the world today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, it has been shown that all humans alive are descended from a single male and a single female, although the female is thousands of years (ten's of thousand's?  I don't remember) before the single male, so there must have been a fair amount of history before the human story condensed down to this mystery man.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
