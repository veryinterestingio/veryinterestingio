		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>RNA is very thermostable at -80C, and becomes increasingly less stable and more prone to degradation as temperatures rise. -20C is a good temperature for storage measured in months, and 4C is good in terms of a few weeks, while room temperature storeage can result in degradation in hours to a few days.</p>
<p>What makes RNA so unstable is the hydroxyl ion at the 2' position of the ribose backbone. This hydroxyl ion can cause hydrolysis of the phosphate linker that connects successive RNA bases in the chain. The higher the temperature, the more likely this is to occur. The hydroxyl is susceptible to other types of degradation, including RNAse enzymes.</p>
<p>The hydroxyl is missing in DNA (this is what deoxy refers to in DNA) and as a result, DNA is very stable at room temperature, and can strongly resist degradation.</p>
<p>Another important factor is that RNA has structure where lengths of the RNA chain pair up forming &quot;hairpins&quot; and loops. The hydroxyl helps to stabilize these structures that are important for RNA function, and in this conformation, the hydroxyl is also protected, but heat can cause these structures to &quot;melt&quot; and expose the hydroxyl.</p>
<p>Now, an example of a protective modification is the replacement of the 2' hydroxyl with 2'OMe, that is the addition of a methyl group to the oxygen.  RNA used in drug therapies will often have this 2'OMe modification either the entire length of the RNA molecule, or at select positions. There are a number of other modifications that offer some extra  stability to the RNA, as well. And as it happens, Moderna owns the patent to a large number of mRNA modifications. Not only do they own the patents, but they also have an incredible knowledge base and a lot of experience to be to able implement these technologies</p>
<p>Fortunately, in regards to COVID-19, Moderna is not enforcing their patents against other companies that want to use those technologies for their own SARS Cov-2 mRNA vaccines, but it is reasonable that Moderna's vaccine may have greater thermal stability than vaccines made by other companies and they will also be able to more quickly assess the storeage needs for their mRNA than other companies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's likely that the difference has been exaggerated.  They're both mRNA in lipid nanoparticles, and the differences are likely down to the details of the specific formulations, i.e., the size and composition of the lipid nanoparticles an the mRNA itself.  Not much information has been released, however, by which to compare them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While it’s possible that differences in LNP formulations or mRNA secondary structures could account for the thermostability differences, many experts suspect both vaccine products will ultimately prove to have similar storage requirements and shelf lives under various temperature conditions. “I don’t think there’s any reason to assume that any of them will be different in terms of their stability,” says Tom Madden, president and CEO of Acuitas Therapeutics in Vancouver, British Columbia, the company behind the LNPs used in the COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and CureVac. Describing the –70 °C cold chain as “most conservative approach,” Madden notes that more long-term data, presented in full rather than in a press release, are needed to resolve the issue.</p>
