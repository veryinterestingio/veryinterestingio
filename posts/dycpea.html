<p>I'd say <strong>tarmac is just a term to mean any surface on which an aircraft sits that's not a taxiway or runway</strong>. Sure it may not be literal anymore, but the term itself has lived on. Kind of like Coke, there's no cocaine in it anymore, but they still call it Coke </p>
<p>And just so you know  Tarmacadam is a road surfacing material made by combining macadam surfaces, tar, and sand, patented by Welsh inventor Edgar Purnell Hooley in 1902. The terms &quot;tarmacadam&quot; and tarmac are also used for a variety of other materials, including tar-grouted macadam, bituminous surface treatments, and modern asphalt concrete. The term is also often used to describe airport aprons (also referred to as &quot;ramps&quot;), taxiways, and runways regardless of the surface. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Most airports are concrete now.</p>
<p>Thus - it is just an old shortening of a type of road surfacing that used to be common place - and even though these areas are no longer even made with Tarmacadam - the nickname stuck around from when it was.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>'Macadam' is a road surface made of compacted layers of crushed stone.</p>
<p>Adding tar and sand to hold everything together and create a safer surface with no dust results in 'tar macadam'.</p>
<p>'Tar macadam' was contracted to 'tarmac', which was a registered trademark of  Tar Macadam Syndicate Ltd. In time 'tarmac' was also used to refer to the road/ramp/etc that is covered by tarmac - &quot;the taxi is waiting out on the tarmac&quot; - and through that usage can also refer to road surfaces that are not actually made of tarmac.</p>
<p>Nowadays this is used more in English English, less in American English.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Tarmac is an old phrase hardly used anymore. Like others said it’s what the over surfaces were made of.
Officially:
A Runway is where planes takeoff and land.
A Taxiway is where planes drive to the runway.
And an “Apron” is where planes park.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tarmac is no longer made as coal tar products are mostly banned for safety reasons. The name is historical as tar was resistant to jet fuel and was used around airplanes.
Nowadays, big planes park on concrete as they have a massive weight that rests on small wheels and this can cause divots to form on asphalt pavements (kind of like woman’s high heels that exert several tons a square inch)
The taxi ways and runways are still asphalt products as they are flexible and will take a lot more stress before cracking and they are easier to repair</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
