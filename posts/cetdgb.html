		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To understand this, it probably helps to start with quantum coherence. At a simplistic level, coherence can be thought of as the information that the quantum system holds. More precisely, it is a measure of the relationship between different possible states of the system. Quantum computers rely on this information to function.</p>
<p>If the system is isolated, coherence is conserved. Decoherence occurs when the system interacts with its environment. This means that the information that the system contains gets mixed up with its environment.</p>
<p>Here's a (limited, but useful) analogy. Imagine I have a small bottle of red ink. I can see that it is red because the pigment is highly concentrated. Let's say I now tip the ink into a large lake or the ocean. At first I can see the colour, but it slowly starts dispersing. After a while, I can't distinguish the ink (system information) from the ocean (environment). The larger background completely overwhelms the smaller system, making it impossible to separate. Quantum decoherence is like that. If you are interested, you may also want to look up quantum entanglement.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Distilling quantum things into understandable terms is exceedingly difficult. It's easy to say things simply, but it always leaves out critical details and risks leaving the reader with the wrong understanding of quantum phenomena. I'm going to gloss over and poorly explain large parts of quantum mechanics in the hope of establishing an accurate non-quantum concept of decoherence with some idea to how it applies to the quantum world. </p>
<p>Quantum systems exist as probability functions known as wave functions. Already some readers will take issue with what I've written, and it only gets worse from here.</p>
<p>When an observation or measurement of a quantum system takes place, the wave function &quot;collapses&quot; prior to observation. We are observing classical properties, like momentum and position, in our physical world. </p>
<p>Once the collapse happens the system ceases to exist as it were. In classical qm this is explained by a collapse leading to a new set of wave functions with different probabilities and properties to describe the system. In a more modern approach, observations can also be made in such a way that they only disturb part of a system and only a partial collapse happens. Under some circumstances we also have a much better idea of what the new system will look like.</p>
<p>Decoherence states that an isolated, coherent quantum system that ceases to be isolated incorporates quantum properties of its environment. And to expand beyond that requires a significant amount of background knowledge in how quantum mechanics works. An analogy:</p>
<p>Imagine a rain drop falling from the sky that you measure as it strikes one of the great lakes. </p>
<p>At some philosophical level the rain drop still continues to exist after interacting with the lake. It just interacted with a new environment and is no longer observable in isolation. If you were to continue to observe the &quot;rain drop&quot; it would behave radically different than it had while in free fall through the atmosphere. Any model you had of the rain drop prior to that interaction would no longer work.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is no discernible change in the great lake's volume, temperature, and other observable properties due to a single rain drop. The great lake may as well have infinite volume and infinite capacity to absorb any observable quantity of the rain drop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A prediction in quantum mechanics is of the following form: given a target system that is prepared a certain state, and given we will choose to measure a certain observable, what are the possible measurement outcomes?  Due to the <em>uncertainty principle,</em> the outcomes will generally be distributed across a range of values, eg we detect some photons everywhere across the full width of the screen behind the double slit.  Due to <em>interference effects</em> some of those values/impact spots will be more or less likely than others, and different from what a classical trajectory theory would predict, e.g. the double slit pattern is fringey (alternating regions of high and low concentrations in the build up).  </p>
<p>Decoherence is just the name of the phenomenon where if the target system interacts with external degrees of freedom (such as the air, thermal radiation, or a non-demolition measurement apparatus) between preparation and final measurement, the interference effects are suppressed in the final measurement results, so the distribution of possible outcomes loses its fringey-ness, and looks like a sum of simple classical trajectories rather than an interfering quantum wave.</p>
<p>But how and why a single photon appears at only a single spot is a separate issue, which is the main focus of measurement problem interpretations (many worlds, collapse, hidden variables) nowadays.  Decoherence does not solve this - it does not reduce the uncertainty of the state, just reduces the interference among paths - though there often much confusion around this point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
