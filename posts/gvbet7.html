		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who used to work in a fruit fly science lab, the above answers are all correct! They can come in by laying their eggs in skins of fruits and some veggies, they particularly like bananas and the stem area of apples. A good wash will help remove them. I also freeze skins of fruits before throwing them in the trash (like banana or lemon peels) as that also kills the eggs and keeps them from hatching while in the trash can.</p>
<p>If you do find some in your house, the best way to get rid of them is to mix a little of apple cider vinegar with water and dish soap. Stir until bubbly. The flies are attracted to the smell of the vinegar but will get trapped by the soap!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally they'll come from fruits cause they lay eggs on the skin. What I usually do is rinse all fruits that don't need to go into the fridge (bananas for example) and that solves the problem</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you get fruit from the store, it often has fruit fly eggs on it.  Every step in the supply chain, from the grower to the store, fights them, but there is a limit to how much pesticide you can use on food, and you only have to miss one pair of male and female eggs to breed thousands of them in a week.  </p>
<p>They're also outside, you don't notice them getting in when you open a door.  You notice when houseflies get in, but not fruit flies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work in a fruit fly lab. All the reasons that have been posted are right, but one other reason it seems like that is because fruit flies have an incredibly strong sense of smell. So even if there's just one female fruit fly in your house, it will probably eventually find fruit and lay eggs on it, making more flies within a few days.</p>
<p>Also, I though't I'd mention that this question has been on people's minds for centuries!</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Redi#Entomology_and_spontaneous_generation" target="_blank">Francesco Redi performed a famous experiment in 1668</a> where he put pieces of fresh meat in two jars: one with a cloth covering over it, and one that was open to the air. The one with the covering didn't grow any maggots, while the one open to the air did. Prior to this experiment, many people though that maggots spontaneously came out of meat without eggs being laid, because they made the same observation you did, that &quot;hey, fruit flies and maggots seem to just appear on meat out of nowhere, and I didn't see any flies laying any eggs.&quot; But of course, at some point some fly did lay an egg, it's just that there was no person there to see it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
