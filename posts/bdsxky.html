But whenever I make ice cubes with the same water and use them, the water tastes so much more different. Almost like it has more of a &quot;metallic&quot; aftertaste if that makes any sense.</p>
<p>This doesn't make any sense to me, and I'm no expert in chemistry. Explain?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a theory still being tested, but it more than likely has to do with oxygen levels in the water. Ice holds a higher oxygen level than water does, and continues to hold more oxygen for a short period of time after melting. Researchers have theorized this to be the cause of the difference in taste.</p>
<p>Edit: the reason ice has more oxygen is because water expands as it freezes, and oxygen fills that void.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to always drink ice water, even in Winter. These days I just have a water filter in the fridge as it just tastes better.</p>
<p>It is something that has plagued me and so I have payed close attention to how it is affected, so truths mixed with personal anecdotes ahoy.</p>
<p>Ice will actually absorb odour from the fridge and affect the taste. Smelly stuff like Kimchi for instance absolutely will change the taste, but either way your freezer will have a odour when you put food in it. I feel like you can even taste the difference between the silicone ice trays and plastic ones. I also feel like water for the ice tray will probably taste different in general (calcium and mineral build up? filters bad? just a theory)</p>
<p>The more transparent an ice cube is, the less taste it has as well, which goes with the less oxygen theory. I believe these clear ice cubes are frozen at much faster rates so less time to absorb odour as well. The shame here is that these ice cubes are really tiny so they water down a drink much faster, but they are great for water. Occasionally you can find these ice cubes at different locations have a bit of a taste too, and I think that just shows there's more than one factor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
