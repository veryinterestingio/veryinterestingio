		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ELI 5 answer is &quot;Energy&quot;. Matter can be converted into Energy. Einsteins famous formula E=mc\^2 describes exactly this. E is energy, m is mass (matter) and c is the velocity of light. It is a mind boggling concept. But nuclear energy is an application or proof of the concept. The matter that remains after nuclear fission weighs less than the matter weighed before. The difference in weight is converted to energy.</p>
<p>The idea that matter can't be created or destroyed was first postulated by Antoine de Lavosier a french scientist in the 18th century and it is still perfectly fine, as long as you only apply it to chemical reactions and leave the nucleus of the atoms intact. Einstein came up with his theory in the 20th century. It is a fine example how science works. Nothing is sacred. Everything that we think we know can be thrown over if somebody has a better idea. As long as you can proof it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OP is essentially asking &quot;how can something come from nothing?&quot;</p>
<p>But the big bang is not something coming from nothing. </p>
<p>The theory of the big bang says that near the beginning of time, everything (as in, all the things in the universe. In fact, the universe itself) was at a single point. </p>
<p>There weren't less things. There was the exact same amount of things. There was just less space. More specifically, there was zero space. </p>
<p>The big bang is just that space very rapidly expanding, giving more room for the stuff to spread around.</p>
<p>Edit: I had assumed that OP was ultimately asking about the big bang theory, but I had no right to make such an assumption. </p>
<p>So I will come out and say that I have not at all explained the origin of matter or energy or information, and have thus technically failed to answer the question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lawrence Krauss has a very good lecture on the origins of the universe, how we know and where matter comes from. It's ELI18 but that's quite the simplification from what he teaches PhD students</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ImvlS8PLIo" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ImvlS8PLIo" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ImvlS8PLIo</a></a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Long story short, some kinds of energy are mathematically negative. Matter is a form of energy. If you were to add up all energy (including matter) the net sum would be zero.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one knows for sure. Most of the matter we can see (stars) is Hydrogen that was made in the first microseconds after the Big Bang but our understanding of the Big Bang is spotty at best.  Many of the heavier elements have been made by stars fusing lighter atoms into heavier ones and supernovas have scattered heavy elements across the galaxies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't know. The only explanations we have are the highly speculative guesses that we're in a simulation or a god created it (which does not mean that either are true). The big bang contributes nothing to how stuff came into existence, only how it behaved once it did. So the only answer we have is that we don't know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
