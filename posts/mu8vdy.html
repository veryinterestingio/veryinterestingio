Also, considering the change in gut behavior from a closed gut to an open gut.</p>
<p>Can anyone shed some light on the subject?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes but I don't believe there are any studies testing thresholds for protection. Probably unethical.</p>
<p>For SARS-CoV-2 vaccines there is evidence of transfer through breast milk:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This study found robust secretion of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA and IgG antibodies in breast milk for 6 weeks after vaccination. IgA secretion was evident as early as 2 weeks after vaccination followed by a spike in IgG after 4 weeks (a week after the second vaccine). A few other studies have shown similar findings in women infected with COVID-19.<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778766#jld210027r5" target="_blank">5</a> Antibodies found in breast milk of these women showed strong neutralizing effects, suggesting a potential protective effect against infection in the infant.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>COVID-19 mRNA vaccines generated robust humoral immunity in pregnant and lactating women, with immunogenicity and reactogenicity similar to that observed in non-pregnant women. Vaccine-induced immune responses were significantly greater than the response to natural infection. Immune transfer to neonates occurred via placenta and breastmilk.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We did not detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in milk produced by women with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. Moreover, we demonstrated that milk contains anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and that their concentrations are correlated with milk’s ability to effectively neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.</p>

So even if they do get antibodies through the breast milk (which seems to be the case in several early papers), there is no way for them to enter the blood stream. The antibodies will only be present in mucosal surfaces.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To these answers I would add that babies also get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_milk_oligosaccharide" target="_blank">Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOs)</a> from breast milk, which contribute to immunity. We don't know every detail about how they work yet but it's certain that they have a prebiotic effect, contributing to healthy gut bacteria. This in turn leads to a stronger immune system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Idk if this helps but animals like cows and horses rely solely on colostrum as they have an epitheliochorial placenta that does not allow the passage of any immunoglobulins during pregnancy. Their gut actually does start to close within 12 hours and fully closed past 24 hours. They do blood testing in foals to test for failure of passive transfer. In vet school colostrum importance is really emphasized.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
