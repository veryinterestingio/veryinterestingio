Edit for anecdote:
My husband sprays his cologne on his skin after a shower in the bathroom connected to our bedroom. Four times already since I've been pregnant, the scent of the chlorine from the water combined with the scent of the cologne suddenly woke me up and sent me running to the guest bathroom violently barfing ?... he has to put cologne on downstairs now!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm about 18 weeks pregnant right now and I can smell everything!  I can smell what people ate for lunch and I'll try to identify it with a good accuracy level. It's a combination of stuff that makes us this way which people have commented before. Hormone levels is a big one including the hormone HCG. There are several theories for what the purpose of this increased sense of smell is the best and most sensible of which is as a protective mechanism. For instance there are some food I absolutely refuse to eat and others I can't get enough of. This strange change in olfactory sense also changes the woman's nutritional intake which can keep her from eating foods high in bacteria and make sure she gets the extra nutrition she needs for the babies growth. It could also be useful for evading predators if a woman lived in the wilderness. I can smell my dogs from across the yard for instance. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a differens between being able too smell something when you are trying really hard and noticing that there is a smell in the room that you just entered. </p>
<p>Getting pregnant won't affect the first of these two but it can/will affect the later. </p>
<p>There is something called the odor detection threshold, it's the the lowest concentration of a certain odor compound that is perceivable by the human sense of smell. That's you trying really hard too detect
if there is a smell. </p>
<p>I don't have the english name for the other threshold. This threshold describes at which level you can notice a smell without being asked about it. It's this threshold that gets lower in pregnant women. </p>
<p>Short version: Pregnancy doesn't make you able too smell better just makes you notice smells more. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
