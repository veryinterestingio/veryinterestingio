		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cause of the &quot;downgrade&quot; was the discovery of multiple bodies that are now called &quot;Trans-Neptunian Objects&quot; (TNOs). These TNOs are of a size comparable to Pluto (but a bit smaller) and orbit the Sun in similar orbits.</p>
<p>Before these discoveries, it was assumed that Pluto was the only significant object in its orbital region, just like it is for the 8 planets. But the discovery of the TNOs showed that Pluto is different from the 8 planets in that it has a lot of compatriots in its orbital region.</p>
<p>This brought up the question of how many planets there are exactly. If Pluto is a planet, then one could say that several of the TNOs could be classified as a planet as well. So instead of facing the possibility of having to deal with a greatly increased number of things we call &quot;planet&quot;, the decision was made to be more strict in calling something a planet. </p>
<p>In 2006, the International Astronomical Union came up with 3 requirements for something to be called a &quot;planet&quot; in our solar system:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It's in orbit around the Sun.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's big enough to have reached hydrostatic equilibrium. In less fancy terms: It's (mostly) round.</p>
</li>
<li>It's big enough to have cleared the neighborhood around its orbit.</li>
</ul>
<p>That last requirement is the one that Pluto fails. It's not the only thing of importance in the area around its orbit. Along with the new definition of a planet, the definition of a &quot;dwarf planet&quot; was introduced, which is anything that meets the first two requirements, but not the third, and is not a satellite (moon).</p>
<p>This definition covers Pluto and several other TNOs.</p>
<p>So the short answer to your question is that the discovery of multiple objects that are comparable in size to Pluto led the IAU to redefine what it means to be a planet and this new definition dropped Pluto from the list of planets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not wanting lots of &quot;planets&quot;. What really pushed the issue was the discovery in 2005 of Eris which is more massive than Pluto. Any objective non-arbitrary definition of &quot;planet&quot; was either going to have 8 known planets (excluding Pluto) or have pushing 20 with more being discovered all the time and maybe a couple of hundred in total.</p>
<p>Stern &amp; Levison had already in 2000 worked out the idea of &quot;clearing the neighbourhood&quot;. Some objects orbiting the Sun, such as Jupiter and Earth, have enough mass to gravitationally dominate their orbital zone, and anything else is either ejected or locked in an orbital resonance with the massive object. Other objects, such as Pluto and Ceres, are massive enough to make themselves round, may have interesting geology and even weather, but do not dominate their orbital zone and indeed might themselves be in orbital resonance with something big.</p>
<p>So we get two aspects shared by planets and dwarf planets. They orbit the Sun, and they have enough mass to be in hydrostatic equilibrium (rounded). And one aspect planets have and dwarf planets don't: clearing the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The last aspect was the IAU voting that &quot;dwarf planets&quot; are not &quot;planets&quot;. Resolution 5B sought instead to consider them all planets, divided into &quot;classical&quot; and &quot;dwarf&quot;, but was defeated by a big margin.</p>
<p>Among currently known solar system objects, it happens that they all either definitely do or definitely don't clear their neighbourhood. Whether you use theory-based calculations or observation of orbiting objects there are no borderline cases. It also happens that all dwarf planets are smaller than all planets. This does not theoretically have to be the case. The mass required to clear the neighbourhood increases with orbital radius, so a Mars sized object in the Kuiper Belt could be a &quot;dwarf planet&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something that I feel worth adding is that the distinction doesn't really actually matter all that much. The debate arises out of a desire to put things into discrete categories. And scientists <em>love</em> to put things into categories. But the reality is that the boundaries of categories are often fuzzy, and there's more of a continuum.</p>
<p>And it is really hard to think of circumstances where it actually matters whether you call Pluto a planet or not. The only real cases I can think of are when it comes to teaching. Calling it the ninth planet slightly obscures the fact that there are other objects like it. Leaving it off the list of planets that children learn about slightly obscures the fact that it exists at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not that the definition changed, but that there <em>was no definition</em>.  After astronomers formalized a definition, Pluto did not meet the criteria for that definition.  I.e. Pluto has not &quot;cleared the neighborhood of its orbit&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
