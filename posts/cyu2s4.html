		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of times, they didn't. </p>
<p>However, methods of treating wounds before antibiotics included cauterization, alcohol, honey, moldy bread, and maggots. As disgusting and improbable as it might sound, these are actually fairly good ways of preventing wound infection in the absence of antibiotics. Other people have already discussed cauterization and alcohol, so I'll focus on the others. </p>
<p>Honey has antibacterial properties and its gooey texture helps seal off wounds. Bread mold is basically what penicillin is made of, so... And many species of maggots only eat dead tissue, so if they're put into a wound that's turning necrotic, they can remove all the dead tissue and promote healing. For that reason, maggots are still sometimes used today.</p>
<p>However, I'd really not recommend trying any of this at home.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, in Carlisle, England, officials were experimenting with a sewage treatment, using carbolic acid to reduce the smell of sewage cess pools. Having heard of these developments and having himself previously experimented with other chemicals for antiseptic purposes without much success, Lister decided to try carbolic acid as a wound antiseptic. He had his first chance on August 12, 1865, when he received a patient: an eleven-year-old boy with a tibia bone fracture which pierced the skin of his lower leg. Ordinarily, amputation would be the only solution. However, Lister decided to try carbolic acid. After setting the bone and supporting the leg with splints, Lister soaked clean cotton towels in undiluted carbolic acid and applied them to the wound, covered with a layer of tin foil, leaving them for four days. When he checked the wound, Lister was pleasantly surprised to find no signs of infection, just redness near the edges of the wound from mild burning by the carbolic acid. Reapplying fresh bandages with diluted carbolic acid, the boy was able to walk home after about six weeks of treatment.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenol#cite_note-BBC_Books_-_Randomhouse-44" target="_blank">[44]</a></p>

<p>phenol is an interesting compound for its antiseptic properties. It was championed by  Joseph Lister</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>DO NOT attempt to do this!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>So. The idea was pour alcohol on wound. Take a big gulp for yourself. Get a bunch of people to hold you down while someone brave heats an iron rod and sticks the damn thing in the wound</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My grandfather told me this story shortly before he died: his father (my great grandfather) stepped on a large nail while working on the farm. He was afraid it would get infected and he would die and there were no antibiotics. </p>
<p>Here is how he treated the wound: he ran a cloth through his foot (the nail had passed all the way through). Each day he would soak the rag in alcohol and pull it through the wound until it had started to heal sort of like a pierced ear or tongue. The alcohol helped keep it from getting infected. Grandpa said it must have hurt like hell but it was the only thing that kept his dad alive and not infected so he just gritted his teeth and did it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
