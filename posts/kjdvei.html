In addition too this, there is also always the chance of a false negative or false positive with any test.  No test is 100% accurate and incorrect results could come from things as simple as mislabeling of a specimen or some other human error.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the infectious period is considered to be 2 days before symptom onset or a positive test (right now, this is all brand new and changes based on new info). It takes a while for the virus to incubate to a point where it's detectable, and it appears to be contagious before a positive test, which is why people grabbing a single test before travel has been so ineffective. This has been most obvious in situations where there is routine testing, long term care facilities, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Provided you get a PCR nasal swab test, the false negative rates (where you test negative but are actually positive) are high. Timing seems to play the highest role. <a href="https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/journal-scans/2020/05/18/13/42/variation-in-false-negative-rate-of-reverse" target="_blank">This study from the American College of Cardiology</a> states that PCR tests are least helpful in detecting COVID on day 1, and most helpful on Day 8; here's the relevant section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the 4 days of infection before the typical time of symptom onset (day 5), the probability of a false-negative result in an infected person decreased from 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 100%-100%) on day 1 to 67% (CI, 27%-94%) on day 4. On the day of symptom onset, the median false-negative rate was 38% (CI, 18%-65%). This decreased to 20% (CI, 12%-30%) on day 8 (3 days after symptom onset) then began to increase again, from 21% (CI, 13%-31%) on day 9 to 66% (CI, 54%-77%) on day 21. The false-negative rate was minimized 8 days after exposureâ€”that is, 3 days after the onset of symptoms on average.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/23/upshot/coronavirus-tests-positives-negatives.html" target="_blank">recent article from the New York Times</a>, says that a negative test should be considered with your context (exposure/symptoms/prevalence in your area).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
