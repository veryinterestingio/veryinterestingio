	<title>ELI5: Why does a debit card reader ask what kind of debit card you are using? It cancels the transaction if the wrong answer is given, so does that not mean it can tell what kind it is?</title>

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oof, I suppose it's a little late to clarify this post. I didn't expect it to get any attention and at this point my question was sufficiently answered, but for clarity's sake, the specific scenario I was referring to was this:
I am in the USA. I go to pay for a movie ticket with my VISA debit card. I insert the chip and the card reader asks me &quot;VISA Debit&quot; or &quot;US Debit.&quot; I accidentally select &quot;US Debit&quot; and the transaction immediately cancels. I try again, selecting the correct option, and the transaction processes normally. I was confused about why it needed to ask, considering it seemed to have the technology to figure out which one it was. I apologize for the vagueries in my original statement. ELI5 wouldn't let me post a more specific title.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>US checking in. I get prompted for Credit or Debit on my card. Both go through. Credit and Debit transactions are handled by completely different systems.</p>
<p>The differences:</p>
<p>If you select the Credit option, the transaction is processed through Visa, Mastercard, or another major credit card brand as if it were a regular credit card (as in, a card with a revolving line of credit which is not attached to a bank account). The merchant doesn't know that this is a bank card and not a credit card. They get their money and pay a 1.5% - 3% fee on the transaction. The transaction is also subject to consumer protections regarding credit cards; the consumer is never liable for any more than $50 (every bank goes over and beyond by making the liability $0, even though they don't have to.)</p>
<p>If you select the Debit option the terminal is now an ATM and the transaction is handled by a debit processor (the logo is on the back of the card, examples include Star, Pulse, Nyce, Accel, and Maestro). It's treated as a debit withdrawal like if you were at an ATM (though, nowadays, the actual transaction is coded in a way that the bank knows that it's a retail transaction and not an ATM withdrawal). The merchant knows it's a bank card. They get their money and pay a 0.25% - 1.5% fee on the transaction.</p>
<p>The big differences here:</p>
<p>Credit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accepted just about everywhere.</li>
<li>Transaction fee is more expensive for the merchant.</li>
<li>The money may not be debited from your account for a day or two in some cases.</li>
<li>Consumer protection laws exist.</li>
<li>May or may not be secured with a PIN (this is up to the bank and the retailer in the US).</li>
<li>Does not allow 'Cash Back' transactions. (This is a policy thing. Some merchants can just manually charge a larger amount and hand you the difference.)</li>
<li>My bank lets me accrue points on Credit transactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Debit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accepted in a many places but certainly not the level of ubiquity you see with Credit.</li>
<li>Transaction fee is cheaper for the merchant.</li>
<li>The money is immediately debited from your account at the time of the purchase. Debit holds for pre-authorized fuel purchases last only minutes, not days as with credit.</li>
<li>The consumer protection laws on debit transactions are minimal. Most banks will protect you but, to be clear, they are not required to by law.</li>
<li>Always secured with a PIN. The debit protocol requires a PIN for every transaction, no exceptions.</li>
<li>Generally allows cash-back as an option on the terminal. The merchant is allowed to turn this feature off.</li>
<li>My bank does NOT let me accrue points on Debit transactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>In my attempt at being a know-it-all, it seems like I latched onto the wrong part of the post. As far as my attempt at answering as to why it's necessary to prompt for the type of transaction rather than asking the card about the transaction, I don't know the answer.</p>
<p>My working theory, however, and this is just speculation, is that the card doesn't indicate what types of transactions are supported. If you attempt to run the wrong type of transaction, the transaction is declined and a transaction fee is accrued by the mechant. The next best thing to do is ask what type of transaction to try before attempting to run it.</p>
<p>Some banks DO use a standardized subset of card number prefixes exclusively for debit. (This is the first four numbers of the card number.) This is how some terminals can figure out that a card has debit transaction capability.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

On most Verifone Mx915s I install on Buypass generic payment networks, when you insert your debit card It will prompt you to select Visa Debit or US Debit. US Debit is normaly what must be selected just because It cost less for the merchant to prosess it. Generally on generic sites thoes settings can be changed in the Commander. Cant say ive ever seen it prompt the Debit question on a Gilbarco Passport POS system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Australia you can link the chq and sav options to a different bank account. This goes through as a normal eftpos transaction and disappears from you account immediately. Most merchants don’t get charged for eftpos transaction as it’s included in their monthly merchant fee. </p>
<p>If you have a credit card (ie a line of credit from the bank so that you owe the money) then this is linked to the Credit option. </p>
<p>These transactions got through MasterCard, Visa, Diners &amp; American Express and the merchant gets charged a few % by the these companies. This is the way they make their money from to cover unauthorised transactions, loyalty points and fraud (to be fair they also get it from the up to 27% interest they can charge the card holder if they don’t pay on time)</p>
<p>Credit cards have the standard 16 digit number, expiration date, CCV (3 numbers in the back) and in recent years the rfid chips that allow you to tap and pay amounts under $100 without a pin. They are also what’s used for online purchases. </p>
<p>Many consumers prefer to use credit cards to get something now but pay for it at the end of the month (and get loyalty points). Merchants don’t like it as much as they get slugged a few % that eats into their profits.
Consumers also like the tap and go feature for low value amounts to get in and out faster (and can dispute transactions)</p>
<p>In recent years banks have started offering debit MasterCard and debit Visa cards. These have the advantage of credit cards however use your money straight away and you can’t owe the bank anything. The banks love this as it means they are making money off transactions that used to be chq or sav types; and consumers like it for the ease and features of a credit card. Merchants however still get slugged the credit card merchant fee; and the banks don’t have to run a loyalty program (so they make more per transaction)</p>
<p>Terminals themselves are only built by a couple of vendors worldwide and as such they have to program them to work in different markets. Transactions rules in the US are different to the UK which is different to Australia, India, China etc. (actually to be fair banks can customise the terminal firmware for their own requirements however the underlying software is still the same). Firmware updates to terminals in Australia are typically released every 6 months to fix bugs, add features etc. </p>
<p>In terms of the card and the terminal knowing which account you want; the reality is they they don’t. When you insert your card a hidden serial number of that card along with the transaction type (chq, sav, credit), a PIN number (if entered), the merchants terminal ID, date/time are all encrypted and sent to the bank. The bank checks the details; looks up your PIN number it has on file, checks if you have enough money and then responds back to the terminal yes or no. </p>
<p>If you press an account type that is not linked to your card then it still has to send the signal to the bank to check to see if there is an account there. (The card doesn’t know)</p>
<p>There is probably more but that’s a quick 101 for Australia. </p>
<p>Source: I install and manage terminals for many Australian Banks and currently have about 150 terminals in front of me that need reprogramming.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
