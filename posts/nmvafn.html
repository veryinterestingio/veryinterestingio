<li>If we are living in a false or meta-stable vacuum, is it possible for humans to actually trigger the event of changing the higgs field to a more stable vacuum?</li>
<li>The universe is accelerating right now, is there any possibility that this change at some point? Or lets say, could those galaxies find a stable spot like our solar system?</li>
<li>Isn't it a law of physics that no energy is lost, how could the end look like everything is to decay into nothingness? Where is the energy gone?</li>
<li>Is it possible that complete nothingness to be instable? (and trigger another big bang?)</li>

<p>That is following the &quot;end&quot; of the Universe, there would be another &quot;Big Bang&quot; and all the permutations of chemical interactions play out again and again, perhaps resulting in different universes each time or resulting in the exact same universe being created</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I'd like her to know that I read <em>The End of Everything (Astrophysically Speaking)</em> and found it to be tremendously interesting, informative, and surprisingly entertaining. Is she working on another book? What major research is she working on?</p>
