		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason your teeth lined up that way in the first place when you were growing up is because that's the easiest orientation for them to be in your mouth based on the shape of the bones around your mouth as well as the actions of the mouth muscles. </p>
<p>Braces forced them to be in a position they weren't naturally. When teeth are left without the braces forcing them in that position, they'll slowly go back to the way they were before because that position has the least resistance from surrounding structures and normal use.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your teeth are always moving very very slowly and respond to slight external forces. This makes braces possible, since you can put pressure on teeth in the right direction and they will naturally move and the jawbone will reform to accommodate the new positions. This bone has some memory of where the teeth were, since it's a bit weaker where it was newly put down (this is simplifying things fyi). This is why you are supposed to wear your retainers every night for 3 months (for example) after getting work done, and then you can wear them less constantly. In that initial time, the bone structure of your jaw builds around your teeth more in the desired final position and helps make a new memory. This is why you really need retainers early on - otherwise the teeth will &quot;spring back&quot; a bit like a very slow rubber band. You've stretched it to a new position and it needs to be held in that new position until it relaxes there. </p>
<p>Even after many years, your teeth will still slowly move with any slight pressure. If you didn't get rid of the forces that caused them to be shifted in the first place, like an extra tooth or a smaller mouth, that would cause pressure, or if something new changed like you lost a tooth or had dental work done. Or it can come from chewing/talking or from other teeth positions. They will slowly shift to find a more natural position which is often slightly twisted or shifted out of line with the rest of the teeth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a number of reasons. As you age your jaw changes shape sightly causing movement. Your teeth have &quot;memory&quot; where they move slowly back to original position despite orthodontia. Eating, talking and using your tongue all cause some movement over time.</p>
<p>Edit: Retainers are worn at night for the most part and they help hold your teeth in the desired position and also make corrections of  tiny movements that occur when not wearing it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Teeth are surrounded by collagen fibers which are in the periodontal ligament, the interface between the tooth and bone. Some of these fibers have shape and positional memory and when stretched or moved, which will happen when the tooth moves, tend to exert a force to pull the tooth to it's original position. The changes in the bone during ortho movement tend to reorganize these fibers but in difficult or badly done cases, the original fibers stay long to cause a relapse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes crooked teeth are caused by wrong mechanics of chewing, swallowing, clenching jaws, or even stuff like bad posture/spine problems. If you straighten teeth but don't eliminate the core issue of why they grew crooked, they likely will return where they were.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
