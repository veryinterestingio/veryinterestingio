		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can't just look at the hydrogen side, you also have to look at the other half-cell where oxygen, the protons diffusing through the membrane and the electrons flowing through the closed circuit recombine to water. That recombination is what drives the reaction, energetically. Just like H2 and O2 readily burn to form water. A fuel cell does just the same, it only separates the reactions and generates electricity instead of just heat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The part of the picture that you may be missing is that the anode is catalytic. When you say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know theres a platinum plate that the hydrogen hits</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You're only grasping part of the process. The hydrogen is pumped in as part of a humidified stream and it then <em>reacts</em> over the catalytic membrane - which, for the record, is most commonly high weight percent loadings of platinum and ruthenium deposited on carbon. One hydrogen of the diatomic molecule binds to a platinum atom on the electrode and the low applied potential of the electrode facilitates oxidation. Then the electrons from the broken bond flow through the circuit, satisfying a load, and the protons flow through a polymer exchange membrane.</p>
<p>Other comments here are saying that oxygen reduction is the driving force of the reaction, but that's only true in a big-picture sense. As far as the hydrogen on the electrode is concerned, there may as well not be another half-reaction. Electrodes free chemists from the tyranny of enthalpic favorability... an electrochemist can set the potential wherever they want with the electrode. You <em>can</em> oxidize hydrogen without another half-cell. The ORR half cell is just important for making a fuel cell useful instead of it being a fancy energy sink.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the anode, hydrogen gas molecules become oxidized by the platinum.  Oxidation is loss of electrons... a hydrogen gas molecule has two electrons in it, and both of them are &quot;consumed&quot; by the platinum.  In reality, those electrons have a lot of potential energy and really don't want to be at that higher energy state.  They want to minimize their energy by finding a species with a lower energy level (in this case, oxygen gas... more on that later).  This movement from high energy to low energy is what drives the electrical load placed on the fuel cell.  It's exactly the same process as in any chemical battery, just here you're dealing with two gases as fuel (hydrogen and oxygen).  </p>
<p>At this point the electrons are now &quot;separated&quot; from the original hydrogen molecule.  So you have two leftover hydrogen atoms without their electron (they're now positively charged ions)... the most abundant hydrogen atom found on Earth has no neutrons are so we now refer to those two hydrogen ions as simply protons (since that's all that's left).  Those protons, being positively charged, are attracted to the cathode which is negatively charged.  They travel through the proton exchange membrane towards the cathode where a separate reaction has been going on, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).  At the cathode, oxygen gas molecules are being reduced (gain of electrons) by that very same circuit that initially took them away from the hydrogen molecules.  </p>
<p>When you add an electron to an oxygen gas molecule, you break that oxygen=oxygen double bond since there's no other place for the electron to go.  One oxygen atom now has a brand new lone pair of electrons, which is really tasty looking to the protons that crossed over the membrane, and so they immediately attach there.  The other oxygen atom is a radical species, which is highly reactive, so a second electron transfer process happens, giving it a lone pair as well, which picks up a proton.  At this point you have formed hydrogen peroxide (H-O-O-H), and this species can cause damage to the membrane among other things.  But if that molecule hangs around long enough, yet another pair of electron transfers happens and you break the remaining O-O bond where each oxygen atom picks up a proton yielding two water molecules.</p>
<p>There are a lot of subtleties to the hydrogen fuel cell reaction, and other intermediates are possible.  They are also affected by impurity metals like iron which can lead to excess peroxide formation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well you have to consider the whole cell not only the hydrogen side.
Oxygen really likes electrons and it is very eager to steal them and form water, one of the most stable friendships in the world (hence, but not only, why water is so prevalent on our world).</p>
<p>Imagine a tunnel through a mountain, instead of climbing the whole mountain to get to the other side, now you can use the tunnel. Platinum is your tunnel, elemental oxygen and hydrogen are at the base of the mountain, water is where they want to go.
Platinum makes things much faster and channels the energy release in form of electrons rather then pure heat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To separate an electron from a hydrogen atom you need to give the electron enough energy to break free from the bond it has with the hydrogen nucleus, in a fuel cell they use heat as energy to ionise the atoms. </p>
<p>The energy required to ionise the H Atome needs to be greater than the energy of the electron-nucleus bond. </p>
<p>The energy of the nucleus-electron bond of H is the product of the atomic number of hydrogen ( Z=1) and energy of the orbital the electron is occupying (R=-13.6eV).</p>
<p>En= energy of the electron in n.
R= energy of the 1S orbital of the hydrogen atome. = -13,6eV
Z= atomic number =1
n= energy level of the electron =1</p>
<p>En = (-R x Z) /(n squared)</p>
<pre><code> = (- 13,6 x 1)/1 eV</code></pre>
<p>When En =0 or &gt;0 the electron is no longer attached to the hydrogen nucleus.</p>
<p>So for a H atome you need at least 13.6eV (~8.5x10^19 Joules) to separate its electron from it, which is what these guys are doing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
