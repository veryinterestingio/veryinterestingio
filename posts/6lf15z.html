		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also female &quot;fertility time&quot; is cryptic in humans so the males will try all year to fertilize the females. For most animals there is a clear breeding season mostly visible by color change and/or smell change in one or both sexes. Human females evolved further and don't show males when it's time to breed or &quot;show off&quot; to get a female, so the male puts more effort into a relationship with a female. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an anthropologist, I’ve always thought the answer to this stems from one of our closest evolutionary relatives, the Bonobo.  Bonobos are also sexual throughout their entire lifespan, and juvenile sexual “play” happens quite a lot.  Like us, Bonobos have sex frequently, in a variety of positions, engage in homosexual behavior, and seem to enjoy themselves quite a lot.  However, <em>also like us, sex seems to serve a different purpose in Bonobo society than pure reproduction.</em>  In Bonobos, it functions to soothe aggressions between individuals.  Someone’s upset? Have sex with them.  Want someone’s banana? Don’t just take it and beat them up, have a little sex with them.  Infant is fussing? Masturbate them a bit to calm them down.</p>
<p>Flip to humans.  We also engage in a diversity of sexual acts (unlike other primates), and sexuality also serves a different purpose in our society than just pure reproduction.  It’s not mitigate aggression, but it probably evolved in its current state to form bonds between two individuals or a group of individuals (not saying that’s how we always use it, but that’s probably what it evolved for).  </p>
<p>In short, in evolution, moving sex out of a purely reproductive context has had all sorts of downstream effects, including high levels of sexuality, even when reproduction is taken off the table.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think that this question is pretty interesting because further questions and 'data' need to be taken into consideration.
I think one needs to unpick several assumptions about sex to find an answer.
Couldn't all creatures be called 'sexual' because of reproduction? When does the sexual nature of animals start and finish? Does life span play a part? What about social taboos and the effect of sexual practice? Does level of consciousness play a part on sexuality? Do animals in the wild have different sexual drives to human animals? Would we behave more animal like if our society was different? Why are we more organised and discreet about sex compared to animals on the wild? Do survival and hygiene have anything to do with our sexual behaviour?

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Firstly, having an erection or being <em>capable</em> of climax is not the same as 'being sexual'.  Some of that is just &quot;being biological&quot;.</p>
<p>That aside, we can imagine all sorts of benefial aspects with regards to survival of humans.  Firstly, we used to die a lot younger so being sexual all your life likely connected a lot more to the time period when you could reproduce.  That's probably pretty important!</p>
<p>Additionally, maintaining familial bonds - of which partner-sex is a part - has probably been beneficial to survival of family and community and a key advantage the world.</p>
<p>For me, the ability to continue to provide sperm as long as possible has also probably been better than an alternative - more sperm supply = good (old man sperm! yay!).</p>
<p>There are monkeys that have casual sex and that have non-reproductive sex, child &quot;sex play&quot;, and post menopausal sex.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've read that the ability to have sex all year long, which is especially special for human females, makes it possible for a female and a male to stay in a relationship for a while, which increase the probability of survivance for their child. Since males are using less energy to have babies because to make them it only really requires to have sex, while for females (at least for most primates) it involves pregnancy and nurturing the baby, it makes males more likely to try to have more sex than females. As human's evolution made them more and more social animals and smart, it increased a lot how much care a human needs to fully grow up. It then became less good evolutionary wise for males to just have tones of babies. So females ended up evolving to have sex all year long, which is kind of an evolutionary compromise since males already had those genes. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>why are we also capable of sexual activity well past our sexual prime?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For males, it's simply because since they don't loose a lot of energy, it's just more worthy to take a chance to have a baby, even if there is less say 1 chance out of 10 that he doesn't survive. Most animals actually can reproduce all their adults life, and if they can't, they die really soon after. There is little evolutionary reason for an animal to survive if they don't reproduce. </p>
<p>For females though, the question isn't really why they can have sex, but more why can't they actually reproduce? Or why didn't they evolved to have more ovules? Enough till they die? Well, a teacher of mine said that it's because since it takes so much care for humans to raise babies, it's evolutionary more worthy for females, once old, to take care of their grandchildren more than having a baby on their own. For an old woman, having a baby on her own would mean both big probability to have a sick baby (since older people have bigger chances to have an unhealthy baby) and big probability to don't have that many years to take care of it too, since they can get sick, and/or die since they're old. So, as their grandchildren are also their own DNA, it's worthy.
Then, why is it like that for females, more than males? Because females are always sure it's their own children and grandchildren since they get pregnant. While males sometimes, raise some other's man children, which means that them taking care of &quot;<em>their</em>&quot; grandchildren must be less worthy than keep trying to have children on their own. </p>
<p>(P.S. sorry for the poor English.)</p>
<p>Tltr; humans take so much energy to raise that it's more worthy for people to have just a few and to actually make sure they fully grow up. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
