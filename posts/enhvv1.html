		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a massage therapist I would say that you're probably tired to begin with, and the act of standing and stretching brings your attention from your task at hand back to your body. Once you finish the stretch you probably feel more relaxed physically and mentally and that tired feeling is able to come to forefront of your attention. </p>
<p>Someone else may have a better answer, but this is the most common thing I see in my line of work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The nervous system can in one way be functionally divided into two subsystems: the sympathetic and the parasympathetic </p>
<p>The sympathetic nervous system is what is commonly known as fight, flight or freeze and is activated by exciting stimulus like a boss yelling at you, pressing hard to finish a task or working out. This makes us alert and ready to perform at our best. </p>
<p>The parasympathetic nervous system is what is commonly known as rest and digest and is activated by for example eating, having sex and , you guessed it, stretching activates the parasympathetic nervous system. This makes your body relax with all of the good things that comes with this response - making you feel good and eventually tired.</p>
<p>Also the stretching creates stimuli in the C-fibers to the brain. These fibers send information about the dull type of pain you get from being immobile for long. They also send information about movement. Only one type of information can travel along the fibers at once, thus movement will trump dull ache information and you will feel it as being pleasurable</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
