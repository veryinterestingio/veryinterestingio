Also doesnt make sense at all what I see from the stenographer screen, it is like random letters no in the same line.</p>
<p>EDIT: Im impressed by how complex and interesting stenography is! Thank you for the replies and also thank you very much for the Awards! :)</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stenography is a method of shorthand writing, where commonly used words are condensed into their own symbols or symbol combinations, and uncommon words are spelled out phonetically to reduce the number of needed letters.</p>
<p>For example &quot;cat&quot; is typed out KAT and can be typed using a single sweeping motion of two fingers and the thumb.</p>
<p>Some common shorthand abbreviations are &quot;mn&quot; for machine or &quot;shand&quot; for shorthand</p>
<p>So, a stegograph might read something like:</p>
<pre><code>T . H . . . . .     
. . . . EU . . . S .
. . A . . . PB . . .
. KP A . . P L . .
. . . . . P L . . . .</code></pre>
<p>TH - This</p>
<p>EUS - is  </p>
<p>APB - an  </p>
<p>KPAPLPL - example (broken up into two chords)</p>
<p>The spaces on the form are created because the keys strike the paper at set locations.</p>
<p>Because each of those lines indicates a single simultaneous press of multiple buttons, a stenographer can reach typing speeds of up to 300 words per minute, with the world record being about 375.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A stenographer have to be able to type over 225 words a minute. This is very hard with a normal keyboard so they have to use a stenotype. This is much harder to learn to write on and read (unless you have computers to translate) but when you can use it there is no need to move your fingers around so it is much faster. The concept is that instead of pushing one button at a time you press a combination of buttons. Just like a piano player may push multiple buttons to form a chord. This means you need fewer buttons to type the same information. You are even able to write down more information then with a standard keyboard as a stenographer is often typing the exact sound. Each chord of a stenotype is a complete syllable which means that most words can be expressed using only one or two presses of the buttons. The way a stenotype outputs its text is also a way to speed it up. Typewriters had issues with speed becasuse each type is striking in the exact same spot on the paper. This made it physically impossible to type fast as it would mean two types were in the same place in time and space. But the stenotype solved this by having the types strike the paper in their own spot and just fed out more paper for every chord. So you end up with a strip of paper with seamingly random character scattered all over it. But each line is a sperate syllable and the character (and possition) describes this syllable to anyone who can read it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former stenography student here.</p>
<p>Stenographers use a special machine called a stenotype machine that functions differently from a qwerty keyboard. On a qwerty keyboard, you type letters for words sequentially. On a steno machine, you type a bunch of letters simultaneously; one press of multiple buttons is called a &quot;stroke&quot;. Each stroke corresponds with a syllable. Two syllables, two strokes. Phonetic dictation.</p>
<p>Steno machines used to print out stenotype on a ribbon of receipt-like paper, and then after court adjourned, the stenographer (or an assistant called a scopist) would produce a proper English transcript from that. Some still do it that way (or just use the paper record as a back-up), but a lot of it is fully digital now. The machine saves a record of all strokes you make during a session, then later you hook it up to a computer with special software (which is stupidly expensive), and it dumps all those strokes into a word processor, which converts steno language gibberish like</p>
<p>PROS HOUM WNS SAU T DFD AT T STOR STPH</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>&quot;PROSECUTOR: How many witnesses saw the defendant at the store?&quot;</p>
<p>Between the stenographer and the software, there are all kinds of special tricks and shortcuts you can devise; a stenographer's library of shortcuts is constantly growing to make things easier, kind of like a pro gamer coming up with new macros. For example, a really experienced stenographer might have a whole shortcut that lets them type &quot;how many witnesses&quot; in a single stroke. Or, for example, say a Defendant has some weird hard-to-spell name like &quot;Pryzbylewski&quot;; the stenographer will usually make a one-stroke macro for that before the trial even begins.</p>
<p>The reason for all this craziness is a need for speed. People talk fast as shit, and also double back, repeat themselves, stutter, etc. The stenographer has to capture all of it, because it's all crucial to legal proceedings; a single misstated word at a key moment could be grounds for an appeal with someone's life in the balance.</p>
<p>To be certified as a stenographer, you have to be able to pass a mock-dictation exam that requires you to transcribe 240 wpm at 95% accuracy for like 2 hours straight (or something like that; it's been a while). Some reporters can go as high as 350 or so. Standard human conversation tends to fall around 180-200. All of which is incredibly difficult, if not outright impossible, on a normal keyboard.</p>
<p>It's an incredibly difficult profession that requires years of training and practice. Like...the keys on a steno machine aren't even labeled, and there aren't even keys for every letter in the alphabet; half of the letters you type by typing combinations of multiple other letters. The first couple months of stenography training is just learning to read/memorize this bizarre language and get a handle on how the machine works. The rest is just drilling and speed-tests and drilling and speed-tests and drilling and speed-tests until you can pass the cert.</p>
<p>As a result, steno schools have a crazy high attrition rate (there's a reason I dropped out...plateaued around 200wpm and couldn't get past it). But, if you can make it, it's pretty much guaranteed work anywhere in the country, and it tends to pay pretty well. Especially for quick turnaround of transcripts.</p>
<p>I compare it to learning to play a really complicated instrument. And then you have to use that instrument to play jazz with multiple other musicians, to a song you've never heard before, with tempo that changes constantly, in front of an audience, for hours at a time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stenographer checking in.  A lot of people have answered already, but I'll chime in that I've gotten to a point where it's mainly muscle memory.  I can zone out during work and still hear and take everything down (as long as it's a regular job and not a room of 6 attorneys arguing at once).   The key combinations make everything efficient.  There are things called briefs which are just combinations of letters that can translate to full phrases. Like LAIJ is &quot;ladies and gentlemen&quot;.   Everything is written to be as fast as possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
