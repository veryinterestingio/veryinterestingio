		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on your definition of &quot;fire&quot;.</p>
<p>But in general, it doesn't matter what the oxidizer is.</p>
<p>You can put a piece of wood into a chlorine or fluorine athmosphere and it would burn.</p>
<p>Here's a very nice demonstration with chlorine as the oxidizer and acetylene as the substance to burn.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/tFdPh6wlePs" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/tFdPh6wlePs</a>  </p>
<p>Some substances are even more reactive than Oxygen, and can burn stuff that has already been burned or would normally not burn.</p>
<p>You can burn silicon in oxygen, and get SiO2 or quartz (crystal glass).</p>
<p>You can now expose this crystal glass to fluorine, and it'll react exothermically to for SiF4 and Oxygen.</p>
<p>Another example is explosives. They usually carry their own source of oxygen, like the potassium nitrate in black powder.</p>
<p>Then there's the various rocket fuels, that don't contain any oxygen.</p>
<p>Various hypergolic fuels use a hydrazine and nitrogen Tetraoxide. </p>
<p>No elemental oxygen is necessary.</p>
<p>(While the chemicals often used in hypergolic rocket fuels often contain oxygen, that's not strictly necessary, the oxygen containing versions are just much easier and safer to handle, than their chlorine or fluorine containing analogs. And that's for stuff that is supposed to go boom when mixed. So stuff like chlorine trifluoride is pretty nasty, and will burn concrete for example)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It probably depends who you talk to as to how specifically they'd define it.  But certainly there are other chemicals that burn exothermically - for example anything that can burn with oxygen can burn with fluorine.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Combustion typically requires an oxydizer. Oxydizers are not the same thing as Oxygen. An oxydizer is just an chemical that causes other chemicals to lose electrons, which oxygen just ends up doing a lot, since it's in our atmosphere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Try looking at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine_trifluoride" target="_blank">chlorine_trifluoride</a>, it will burn with almost anything. Best part of that page is the quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If, however, this coat is melted or scrubbed off, and has no chance to reform, the operator is confronted with the problem of coping with a metal-fluorine fire. For dealing with this situation, I have always recommended a good pair of running shoes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also rockets use propellants that will burn on their own such as Hydrazine, check out the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/32jvg7/can_some_things_burn_without_oxygen_if_so_how/cqdhydm" target="_blank">comment</a> by u/Jeffy_Weffy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I can finally contribute to an ask science thread!</p>
<p>In amateur rocketry there is a propellant that was widely used many years ago called “micrograin” that is a pyrotechnic composition of finely powdered elemental zinc and sulphur. They are highly energetic when forming zinc sulphate, (EDIT: actually Zinc SULFIDE from the primary reaction) and the reaction puts of a very pretty flame which varies from bright yellow to a beautiful turquoise green depending on ratios. </p>
<p>So yes, fire can result from non-oxygen reactions, for sure. I believe what you are referring to as fire is simply gasses (or airborne particles) heated to the point of iridescence. This would work regardless of the chemistry that heats them to said point. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
