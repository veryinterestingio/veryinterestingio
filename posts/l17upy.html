<p>It doesn't. Look up vacuum welding, it's fascinating. When you have two very clean surfaces of, say, aluminium, and touch them together in a vacuum, they will weld themselves together because yes the atoms don't 'know' which piece of metal it's a part of. The reason they don't in your everyday experience is because our environment is full of oils, and dirt, and oxygen corroding the metal, so there are multiple dividing layers between the actual metal. </p>
<p>Of course paper is less simple since it's actually a bunch of fibres mashed together.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The scissors blades compress the paper fibres until they break apart. Scissor blades aren't lined up for a reason, what they're doing is basically pulling the paper apart, just in a very small area. It's why very blunt scissors don't cut, they bend the paper instead; the area on which they're pulling is too large, and the force of your hand isn't great enough to pull that many fibres apart</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to the other answers already here, on the atomic level, it's electrons that are responsible for holding atoms 'together'. This doesn't make much sense in terms of our scale of reality, but the electrons &quot;in&quot; an atom, despite being very small, occupy a much larger volume than the nucleus. They can be 'shared' from one atom to another, and that's how atoms stick together and form molecules. Individual atoms in the paper are stuck to adjacent atoms this way, but those big molecules are in turn just kind of mushed together and held together by a mess of fibres and adhesives all kind of tangled together - not the strong connections made by the sharing of elections. The metal in the scissors on the other hand is mostly held together by the sharing of electrons between all the iron atoms in a big 'electron sea,' a property specific to metals. This is basically what's happening when scissors cuts paper: It's very unlikely that anything in the paper would be strong enough to dislodge the iron atoms from each other, but the vastly weaker connections between &quot;paper molecules&quot; (really, the paper fibres) are very easy for the cutting edge of the scissors to get between and mechanically separate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the atomic level, a single atom &quot;belongs to something&quot; as long as nothing kicks it out of place. It's like playing with a grape inside a bowl:</p>
<p>If someone gives you a grape on a bowl, as long as you're careful, you can move the bowl and the grape and it will never fall off and &quot;the grape belongs to the bowl.</p>
<p>If you're not careful or if you move the grape or the bowl too fast, the grape <em>might</em> fall of, and then &quot;the grape no longer belongs to the bowl&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Atoms are like grapes</strong> and <strong>molecules are like bowls</strong>, but <strong><em>the bowl is also made of grapes that also are bowls</em></strong>. Weird, right? We need to read that sentence again to try to understand! </p>
<p>If we think about paper, a single atom of paper is &quot;inside a bowl made of paper atoms&quot;, and unless you kick it with enough force you won't be able to take that paper atom out. That's because &quot;the paper atoms that make the bowl&quot; don't let the paper atom escape.</p>
<p>Scissors work by pushing the atoms in the paper with enough force to take them out of their bowls. They do it in a way where only a few stops in the paper are pushed, and they are all close enough that you can separate the paper into two pieces.</p>
<p>We can think about it as a bunch of eggs on carton holders, the kind that can hold 100 or 144 eggs at a time: </p>
<p>Think about every egg as a single paper atom. If you start pushing eggs from a line or column, your hand becomes like a scissor that cuts trough paper.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This might be dumb but to follow up: on an atomic level how does <em>any</em> atom &quot;know&quot; it's part of anything else? From that perspective is everything not just a giant atomic field? From our vantage point objects appear discrete and separate but on an atomic level?? I hope this makes sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason that an atom knows what sheet of paper it belongs to is due to the fact that the atom is <em>bound</em> to a molecule. A molecule is a bunch of atoms that bond <em>very</em> strongly to one another. The atoms can be arranged in a chain, in rings, or in one of many other ways.</p>
<p>Paper is made up of various different molecules, most importantly <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulose" target="_blank">cellulose</a> in case you want to look it up. Many of these molecules make up fibres and many fibres make up the sheet of paper.</p>
<p>As I said, the bond between the atoms and the rest of their molecule is very strong. Breaking that bond would require a lot of work, that is missing when you simply push two sheets of paper together. The molecule really doesn’t want to give up the atom and there really isn’t a molecule on the other side that would like to adopt another atom.</p>
<p>Now when you cut a piece of paper with a pair of scissors it is very unlikely that you will break the bond between atoms. That is because, the bond between atoms inside of molecules is much stronger than the attraction between molecules. So when you cut a piece of paper you are much more likely to separate two molecules. Although, there is a chance you might also break a bond between atoms.</p>
<p>If you would like to know what bond I’ve been talking about look up “covalent bonding”.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
