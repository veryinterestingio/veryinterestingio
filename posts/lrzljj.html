		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the general level, you're asking about so-called  &quot;attribution studies&quot;, i.e., can a particular extreme event, or types of extreme events, be attributed to climate change. This is, and has been for at least two decades, an active topic of research (e.g.  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03089" target="_blank">Stott et al, 2003</a>, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/106/35/14778/" target="_blank">Santer et al., 2009</a>, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.34" target="_blank">Stott et al., 2010</a>, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.121" target="_blank">Hegerls &amp; Zwiers, 2011</a>, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2011GL050422" target="_blank">Otto et al, 2012</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1452" target="_blank">Coumou &amp; Rahmstorf, 2012</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2971" target="_blank">Otto, 2016</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13351-018-8041-6" target="_blank">Zhai et al., 2018</a>). If you peruse some of those, you'll see generally we can think about this in two ways, (1) identifying new extremes (i.e., is a particular event actually outside the expected range of these types of events based on past climate data) and (2) attributing a new extreme to climate change, which is often done by seeing if forcing a global climate model with anthropogenic influences (e.g., increases in CO2) produces similar extremes and are not expected without the anthropogenic influence. </p>
<p>As discussed in more detail in many of the papers above, it is definitely possible to attribute particular extremes, or shifts in patterns of extremes to climate change, e.g., the 2010 Russian heatwave and associated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Russian_wildfires" target="_blank">wildfires</a> have been linked to global climate change (e.g. <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2011GL050422" target="_blank">Otto et al, 2012</a> also ref'd above). However, a lot of work goes into tying particular events and/or shift in statistics of types of events to global climate change, so it is reductive (and potentially incorrect) to simply attribute any &quot;out of the ordinary&quot; extreme to climate change. Even without global climate change, weather events can be thought of as stochastic, and &quot;drawn&quot; from some underlying distribution. For many types of weather events (e.g., precipitation), these distributions appear to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy-tailed_distribution" target="_blank">&quot;heavy-tailed&quot;</a>, and specifically heavy right tailed. The practical outcome of this is that large and rare events are to be expected, but by definition do not occur very frequently and so we try to estimate their likelihood and magnitude by modeling the tail of these distributions. However, this exercise is challenging because our records may not be complete or long enough to actually know what the correct distribution is to explain the tail (and also gets into lots of somewhat strange ideas like those of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory" target="_blank">black swans</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_king_theory" target="_blank">dragon kings</a>). E.g., if your record is 100 years long, there's a good bet you have not observed an event with an average recurrence interval of 1000 years, so when this occurs, whether this appears to be &quot;out of the ordinary&quot; depends on how you've extrapolated the tail of the distribution. This is independent of climate change, which in detail is potentially changing the nature of the underlying distribution for some types of events in some places, hence the challenge posed by trying to identify whether an extreme event is explained by the distribution of events before climate change or is outside of this distribution (i.e., could be attributed to climate change).</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> With careful analysis, it is possible to relate some specific events or shifts in various patterns to climate change, but because even in the absence of climate change, we expect weather events to have skewed (heavy right tailed) distributions, attributing any apparent &quot;out of the ordinary&quot; event to climate change is extremely problematic without the aforementioned careful analysis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Weather is caused by uneven heating of the earth. The hotter it gets at the equator, the larger difference in potential energy between the equator and polrles, the more energy storm systems will move with. Hot air movibg poleward doesn't imnediately dissolve, it displaces the colder polar air, leading to cold fronts moving towards the equator. </p>
<p>This is a very very very basic simplification, but it's helpful in understanding why climate change will result in more severe weather, including cold spells.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>No such thing as random or erratic weather.  Weather is short/local result of wider actions all of which are based on physics, not the roll of a 20 sided dice.     </p>
<p>When people talk about random/erratic are they talking about &quot;out of norm&quot;, or severity, or and it that in the last 5 years, 10 years, lifetime... etc.  </p>
<p>Weather is absolutely linked to wider Climate events - like El Nino/La Nina.  So the &quot;erratic&quot; weather that large climate event creates (e.g. flooding here, drought their)  are not either random or erratic but understand results.  </p>
<p>Severity of weather is largely based on wider climate issues like available energy, moisture (e.g. hurricane/tornadoes based on available energy and difference),  cold/drought are influenced by the pattern of the jet stream - climate...   </p>
<p>This gets more complicated and controversial if those Climate Events are increasing in occurrence, severity, length based on &quot;Climate Change&quot;.  </p>
<p>Also need to discuss the difference in longer term change.  So it is very clear using available data to show that dates of first/last frost, growing seasons, etc are changing over time (climate) .  That change does not mean that a snowstorm in March is erratic, it might have just been more &quot;normal&quot;, than the last X years.  </p>
<p>So suggest you narrow down specific events to talk those influences</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
