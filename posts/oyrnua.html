		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some housekeeping first, when commenting in AskScience, please <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScience/wiki/quickstart/answeringquestions" target="_blank">remember our guidelines</a> for answering questions, specifically that answers should be based on peer reviewed sources when possible (and there are abundant sources in this case, so it's not a big ask) and should be free of speculation.</p>
<p>Now, with reference to the question, it's worth noting that what's spawned this latest spate of worry about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_meridional_overturning_circulation" target="_blank">AMOC</a> in the press is this paper by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01097-4" target="_blank">Boers, 2021</a>. While interesting (and worrying), Boers doesn't really help us in answering OP's question as this new paper is focused on demonstrating that the AMOC is nearing a tipping point (in the sense of <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/105/6/1786" target="_blank">Lenton et al., 2008</a>) or transition to a significantly weakened state. To think about what the effects of said weakened state might be, we must look elsewhere.</p>
<p>Because the AMOC is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermohaline_circulation" target="_blank">thermohaline circulation</a>, the  primary driving factor in destabilization of the AMOC is usually considered to be the introduction of a large pulse of freshwater in the North Atlantic (mostly from the melting of the Greenland ice sheet). As such, the effects of a (possible) destabilization of the AMOC is often considered in &quot;water hosing&quot; experiments, where basically two  global climate models are run in parallel, one as a control and one where some amount of fresh water is &quot;hosed&quot; into the North Atlantic, reducing the sea surface salinity and influencing the working of the AMOC current. The anomalies (be those precipitation, temperature, etc) between the control and hosed models give us a sense of what the effects of a destabilized AMOC might be. If we look at an example of one of these hosing experiments, e.g. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-015-2540-2" target="_blank">Jackson et al., 2015</a>, we can start to answer the original question. Looking at Jackson et al's Figure 3, we can see on a global scale that destabilization of the AMOC leads to significant cooling (~3-5 degrees C lower average temp) and drying (~2-0.5 mm/day less precip) with respect to the control run in much of western Europe and Greenland. The effects are global though, as it suggests extreme drying in much of the tropics and a broad pattern of cooling in the northern hemisphere and warming in the southern hemisphere. Zooming into western Europe and thinking seasonally, this work suggests that the cooling is most extreme in the winter (e.g., Figure 4). Precipitation also changes seasonally with most of Europe seeing less precipitation in general, but slightly more precip in the winter in the British Isles, and slightly more precip in the summer in southern Europe (Spain, Italy, Greece).</p>
<p>Ok, so, now some caveats. First and foremost, this was just one example and not necessarily representative. Some of the challenges with considering results like those above are that (1) we don't know exactly the right forcing to apply in these models and the effects will differ as a result, (2) the above example was driving both the control and the hosing experiment with a constant, 1980 level of CO2 so from this result at least it's hard to say how this would play out in the context of climate change more broadly, and (3) importantly, many papers highlight that even with the same forcing, different models make different predictions of what will happen (e.g., <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/19/8/jcli3689.1.xml" target="_blank">Stoufer et al., 2006</a>), though the general patterns for many of them remain the same. Finally, AMOC related issues, i.e., whether it will really destabilize and what will happen if it does, has remained a pretty fraught issue. Whether it's likely that the AMOC will weaken but not really destabilize (e.g., <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2005GL024368" target="_blank">Schmittner et al., 2005</a>) vs it being likely that it will fully destabilize (e.g., <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/1/e1601666.short" target="_blank">Liu et al., 2017</a>) has been an argument for a while. Similarly, as highlighted in Stoufer paper above (and many others, e.g., <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-017-3756-0" target="_blank">Williamson et al., 2018</a>), the extent to which the models agree on the effect of varying degrees of AMOC disruption is also problematic. Whether this new Boers paper will move the needle much in the debate remains to be seen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
