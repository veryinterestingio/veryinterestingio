Obviously, I get that one is hemp and the other is marijuana.  But how is it that the flowers/buds come out looking almost exactly the same?  Is there really any difference when it comes to the buds / plants themselves, besides different cannabinoids?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hemp and marijuana are both cannabis.  Cannabis is classified as hemp or marijuana, legally speaking, based on THC levels.</p>
<p>Per the Farm Bill passed in 2018, 'hemp' is cannabis with Delta-9 THC contents under .3% by dry weight, whereas 'marijuana' has Delta-9 THC contents greater than .3% by dry-weight.</p>
<p>There are many strains of cannabis that generally produce Delta-9 THC levels below .3%, and are thus categorized as hemp.  They typically produce much greater levels of CBD, too.  They still have very similar buds to marijuana.</p>
<p>Hemp flower smokes the same, looks the same, and smells the same.  The experience is familiar, but unique.</p>
<p>Total effective THC levels in 1g of good hemp flower match that of a standard edible dose, so you can still feel 'high'.  The likelihood of experiencing anxiety with your high is much lower because (1) hemp flower generally has ultra high levels of CBD, and (2) THC levels are about 1/20th that of typical marijuana.</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of hemp flower, or what I call 'bud light', myself.  I used to smoke traditional bud all day every day but it's hard to do that at my age and even appear responsible.  A more modest experience is exactly what I've needed for a long time and I'm so glad to have discovered it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The one guy in this thread gave a detailed explanation but I will offer a simple one. They are the exact same plant. “Hemp” is a political term classifying marijuana under 0.3% thc. They look, smell, and taste the same because they are the same. Think of hemp as a strain of marijuana that just doesn’t produce thc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
