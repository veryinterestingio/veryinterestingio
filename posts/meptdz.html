		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically same way we don't damage using parachutes. Some bugs have simply air friction and weight ratio that it's like having a natural parachute at all times.</p>
<p>To a such bug, air is more like a liquid, so it falls through it like you would sink into a deep lake. Even if lake is super deep - like 15 stories deep, you still won't crash the bottom of the lake in the end, water slows you down so much all the way. </p>
<p>Even though acceleration by gravity is same, water limits the speed you end up with (called terminal velocity) much more than air would. But if gravity was - 10 times stronger - say - on different a planet or whatever, you could totally splat to the bottom of such lake and water friction couldn't overcome it enough to save you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you get scaled down so you're half the height, you're 1/4 as strong, and have 1/4 the surface area, but you're only 1/8 as heavy. This continues the smaller you go. For a very small bug, you might have a surface area to weight ratio similar to a sheet of paper.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a very useful thought tool called &quot;squares versus cubes&quot;.  The idea is that if one property is proportional to the square of something, and another property is related to the cube of something, you can pretty much ignore everything else.</p>
<p>In this case, the mass an object (an insect, in this case, but the same applies to all objects) is roughly proportional to the cube of its length, because stuff on the inside has mass.  And the drag that an object experiences is roughly proportional to the square of its length, since it's only the leading surface that has to push through air.</p>
<p>So the bigger a thing gets, the less drag matters, and conversely, the smaller a thing gets, the more drag matters.  Bugs, being very small, are greatly slowed by the air they're falling through because the ratio of their mass (which gravity pulls against) to their area (which wind pushes against) is small.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you fall you push air around you. Feel it with your hand. The air is also pushing on you. When a bug falls, the air pushes against it too hard for it to go fast because it it so small and light. Drop a leaf and a rock, observe.</p>
<p>Edit: Gravity pulls on the leaf and rock equally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
