		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In broad terms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Serotonin</strong> regulates your mood and plays a role in sleep, digestion and wound healing. </li>
<li><strong>Dopamine</strong> regulates your motivation and plays a role in your ability to regulate your own behaviour.</li>
</ul>
<p>More specifically, serotonin (or lack thereof) is responsible for things like happiness, relaxation, anxiety, insomnia, sadness and satisfaction. Dopamine (or lack thereof) is responsible for things like determination, interest, concentration, clarity of thought, task completion, addiction, ADHD and depression.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been taking ADHD medication as an adult which just kinda floods your brain with dopamine for a few years, so I know what dopamine is like.</p>
<p>Firstly, dopamine is *not* 'the pleasure chemical'. This is a long enduring misconception. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter for a number of systems. The best way I can describe dopamine is the feeling you get when you finish watching a really great film, or just as you're winning a race, or doing well on an exam. It's the feeling you get when you're anticipating something you really look forward to. -- and you feel 'capable' and in control.</p>
<p>Dopamine's association with pleasure is due to its position in reward-motivated behavior. When you anticipate or achieve success, dopamine is promoted, but dopamine doesn't feel like pleasure, it feels like succeeding at something, like things are going to go, or are going right. In normal people, dopamine is somewhat allocated to different things, and depending on how much is released you feel more capable of doing that thing, which is why people with ADHD have such trouble prioritizing and focusing on tasks, and why taking ADHD medication doesn't make you good at prioritizing, just doing <em>anything</em> that's put in front of you. It's not subtle. Everything just seems worth doing.</p>
<p>The dopamine systems affect a <em>lot</em> of systems. Notably: hunger and memory. If you get a lot of dopamine, naturally or otherwise you won't feel hungry. You probably won't feel tired either, but like you can power through whatever you need to do. People with low dopamine don't remember much because the brain uses dopamine as a way of knowing how memorable an event is. It also affects pain, but personally it doesn't reduce pain, but the <em>fear</em> of pain. It will still hurt, but you have every ability to <em>decide</em> not to worry about it so much. Like when you were injured as a kid vs as an adult. Dopamine also affects your heart rate, your blink rate and a million other things you experience when you're really anticipating something or experiencing some kind of success, like falling in love.</p>
<p>In my understanding, the seretonin systems mediate stress and a feeling of wellbeing, but I've never personally been on SSRIs.</p>
<p>Personally, I think because most people have never taken a drug in which they experience a certain kind of pleasure in a vacuum, it's common to conflate the effects of all pleasure and reward processes together when there are a lot of different kinds. Addiction, for example is almost entirely caused by the action of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSB#cite_ref-38" target="_blank">ΔFosB</a>. Laughter, orgasm and pain produce morphine-like substances called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorphins" target="_blank">endorphins</a>. The pleasure of seeing your children, cuddling and spending time with your partner is <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytocin" target="_blank">oxytocin</a> mediated.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>hope this helps. it's pretty important to me people get a better understanding of this stuff :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
