		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cortisol is for long term stress so it makes you tired and fat to conserve and store up energy. Adrenaline is for short term stresses so it fires you up and gets you going. They both stimulate glucose release though.</p>
<p>This is the simple version though. Hopefully someone will give you something more in depth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With regards to cortisol, generally, under acute stress, cortisol enhances the immune system. It digests fats and peptide chains into simple sugars, basically stealing energy away from other body systems to prepare your body for immediate action.</p>
<p>I don't know much details about adrenaline, only that it helps to increase blood pressure, and to inject the sugars from the blood stream into our muscles. But cortisol and adrenaline probably work together with similar functions. Cortisol, however is known as the main stress hormone.</p>
<p>Both are influenced by the HPA axis (Which is essentially the bridge between the outside world, and a physiological response to that stress).</p>
<p>Under chronic stress, there is an immunosuppressive effect, but this occurs because of a dysregulation of cortisol. This means cortisol can become less effective at doing its job.</p>
<p>Our brains are constantly evaluating the environment for potential threats, and so when we see something that can harm us, the brain makes an executive decision to signal for molecular change; creating an adaptive response to the hazards it perceived. This chemical’s evolutionary purpose was most likely to prepare our bodies for immediate action by stealing energy from our future reserves when in a dangerous situation. However, when the body is exposed to acute stressors on a day-to-day basis, the ever so intricately designed reaction to stress becomes dysfunctional. Chronic stress results in the body producing more cortisol than it can release, which wears down the brain’s ability to function properly.</p>
<p>As cortisol release becomes enforced over a long period of time, one’s sensitivity to stress becomes amplified; changing the standard of his or her response to external stimuli. It negatively affects regions in the brain responsible for judgement and social behavior while enforcing structures in the brain responsible for fear processing. What this implies is that consequences from chronic stress are not limited to physiology. Stressed individuals will be more likely to engage in unhealthy behaviors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cortisol response is for more chronic stress, like when you have too much work to do, or have to study for a test. </p>
<p>Adrenaline gets released in fight or flight situations, where you are in risk, and need to activate your muscles, dilate your pupils, raise your blood pressure and heart rate, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
