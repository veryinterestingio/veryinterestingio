Even the bourbon distilleries where they store the bourbon, many of these are painted black or a very dark color. Do they want the barns to be hot? Why are they painted this way? I’m used to seeing barns painted red.</p>
<p>Edit: Wow! You are all amazing!  Just ask awesome Reddit users and you shall receive. Thank you!</p></div></div>

<p>So they can either paint their warehouses black or paint them white and accept that they'll look halfway fireburned in a few years.</p>

<p>Apparently it's because iron is a common element in the universe due to the specific qualities of star life cycles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>>Red ochre—Fe2O3—is a simple compound of iron  and oxygen that absorbs yellow, green and blue light and appears red.  It’s what makes red paint red. It’s really cheap because it’s really  plentiful. And it’s really plentiful because of nuclear fusion in dying  stars.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends for the red barn thing. </p>
<p>The reason RED was the color was that the farmers had to make their own paint. They used the available pigment which was finely ground iron oxide. They would scrape rust off of metal implements and then grind into a very fine dust and use it in their paint. </p>
<p>RED barns were also use by a lot of artists and advertising. So you/we/pop culture think red was the color.</p>
<p>WHITE was used quite a bit in two different forms. White washing for poorer farmers or those that were near limestone deposits. If you had limestone and there was a place that was making slaked limestone you would use white wash. And your buildings end up white like many of the European cottages and houses of the middle ages. </p>
<p>WHITE was also prevalent if you were near lead deposits. There are tracts of white barns and out building along the early railroad routes where these farmers had access to white lead. It was cheap and has anti bug properties. It kept the wood from getting infested and it stopped a lot of molds, mosses, and fungus. There was actually a recent historical study that looked at the crime/murder rates in areas that had access to the white lead in the late 1700s and through the 1800s. Interesting look at how environmental contamination can affect a population.</p>
<p>BLACK would be creosote to treat the wood to prevent rot and to prevent infestation. (Think railroad ties/sleepers)Pretty prevalent where you have drying barns for stuff. In the south it would be tobacco. It is also pretty prevalent in the south due to the amount of bugs and rot that they have. </p>
<p>So in reality red was not &quot;the norm&quot; for barns. It is in our American vision since it is the color normally chosen in every freaking kids book. But the reality is that White, red, and black were all pretty prevalent it just depended on the area. Also realize that a sizable chunk of barns/out buildings would have been raw wood for some time before they got painted.  MAny farmers starting out would wait to get the supplies to paint. Wood can go many years in the open if not allowed to sit wet and be fine. Especially if you don't have heavy bug infestation or large amounts of rot/fungus. Like much of the American west which was dry and did not have the bug presence like the South. </p>
<p>In the 1870s when they started making premade paints like we have today. Well similar anyway. The number of pigments went up and barns became whatever color was cheapest. But in my area which is in Illinois and was close to railroads all the barns were historically white. It was not until literature and pop culture decided that barns should be RED that they started painting them red here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
