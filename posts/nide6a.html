		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To get a little more technical and add a few more comments to what's already been said:</p>
<ul>
<li>cardiac arrest -- the heart is not pumping blood, defined as one of four rhythms:
<ul>
<li>ventricular tachycardia without a pulse (&quot;v-tach&quot;) -- very fast improper rhythm, not effective at pumping blood</li>
<li>ventricular fibrillation (&quot;v-fib&quot;) -- chaotic rhythm with no real discernable pattern</li>
<li>asystole (&quot;flatline&quot;) -- no electrical activity in the heart</li>
<li>pulseless electrical activity (PEA) -- any other organized rhythm where the heart is still failing to pump blood through the lungs/body (this will eventually deteriorate into one of the other mentioned rhythms if not corrected)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>defibrillation -- essentially a &quot;reset button&quot; for the heart; the goal is to temporarily stop all electrical activity in the heart and hope that the proper pacemaker (one of the heart's nodes that sends out electrical pulses so that the heart pumps blood properly) will take over the electrical activity and restore the heart to a normal rhythm. It is used for ventricular tachycardia (w/o a pulse) and ventricular fibrillation. Automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) are designed to recognize these two rhythms and shock them, but won't shock anything else.</li>
</ul>
<p>CPR should be performed anytime a patient is in cardiac arrest and initially immediately after a shock is delivered (at least the last time I had ACLS which was a little while ago). Getting EMTs and paramedics to the scene ASAP is critically important for numerous reasons, including having them verify whether or not a person has a normal heart rhythm again.</p>
<p>For the layperson, CPR can be done anytime someone is completely unresponsive / not breathing. Many laypeople are very bad at attempting to take a pulse so it's generally not advised. If they start responding and try to get you to stop ... then stop the CPR.</p>
<p>Rescue breaths are often not given anymore (and the fewer interruptions to compressions, the better), although for children and drowning victims, the breaths are more important.</p>
<p>Quick reminder for doing CPR: if you do the compressions too fast, you don't give the heart enough time to relax and fill with blood, and your compressions will be less effective (or not effective at all). If they're done too slow, they won't get the blood pressure up enough to help the major organs receive blood. Play the tune &quot;Stayin' Alive&quot; in your head and keep the beat to that (there's another one that you can use too, but it's a little more morbid ;) ).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The American heart Association recommends that both chest compressions and use of a automated defibrillator are key to survival. When someone goes unconscious CPR teaches you an algorithm for alerting emergency services, beginning chest compressions and getting an AED if ones available. There’s always a big emphasis on starting compressions ASAP. But without the other stuff there’s a low probability of survival.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Defibrillation is done to stop harmful rhythms in the hope that the heart resets itself. Chest compressions are done to crudely mimic heart function in order to maintain some elements of blood circulation.</p>
<p>If you find a patient without a pulse you perform CPR. This just buys you some time to actually fix the problems, it's basically never going to actually fix them.</p>
<p>While you are doing CPR you attach them to defibrillator which not only delivers shocks but can measure heart tracings. If their heart is beating in one of two irregular rhythms (the heart is beating but it doesn't provide enough pumping effect to maintain circulation) then you can shock them and reset it in the hope it restarts normally. If the heart isn't doing anything at all then you don't shock because there's nothing to reset.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you use a community based defib then usually you have started chest compressions already, you hook the defib up and it detects the hearts activity, it will then advise whether a shock is required or not (heart may not be in defib), usually the auto instructions will then tell you to resume chest compressions after the shock.</p>
<p>So essentially they are used in conjunction with each other</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
