		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Overall, it's not totally safe.</p>
<p>It depends on the type of insect, some spray are made to be effective just by sticking on the bug, others are made to be ingested. Most spray focus on the nervous system, but there's tons of others that focus on muscle, breathing, breading, etc ...</p>
<p>90% of spray are neurotoxic, affecting synapse. Synapse is where two neurons connect, or one neurons with anothers cells. We can affect lots of things from there : Gabe receiver, acétylcholinestérase, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, for all those enzyme or receptors we have different product that can affect them, with different reactions. We humans basically have the same stuff, we just have much more neurons and synapse than the insect, requiring much much more to totally stop the communication, and dying from it.</p>
<p>I got a spray in my hand, and they told to spray it, leave and close the room, wait 15 mins, and then aerate the room.</p>
<p>It is harmful to humans.</p>

<p>This dude would be the most ridiculous extreme example, but he died spraying insecticide in his mouth.</p>
<p>As others pointed out dosage/concentration most of the times makes all the difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here’s my ELI5:</p>
<p>Bugs are a lot smaller than a human so a little bit of bug spray for a person is a giant amount for a bug. The difference between medicine and poison is dosage. </p>
<p>Consider this: caffeine is a chemical plants create as a pesticide yet humans drink it. There is an amount of caffeine a human could eat and die, but for a bug that amount is much much less.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5: Most bug killers are poisons that people are able to neutralize, but most insects are not. Some of our pets (like dogs) can neutralize these poisons too, but others (like cats) can't, so we have to be careful when we use these poisons.  </p>
<p>Details: Permethrin is a commonly used pesticide. It's a neurotoxin, but most mammals are able to neutralize it in their liver, while most insects are not. Cats have a defect in glucuronosyltransferase, the enzyme that breaks permethrin down, so they are unable to break it down and are thus intolerant of permethrin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
