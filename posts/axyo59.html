How did the virus evolve this characteristic ? Isn’t that a poor evolutionary trait? Why didn’t it evolve to cause the host a mild encephalitis  and irritable state where the animal would show a degree of aggression but not perish in a week or so? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are looking at it purely from a human/canine/etc perspective.</p>
<p>You're 100% correct that diseases that purely exhibit such extreme symptoms and progression aren't very long-lived, but there's a reason why rabies - unlike eg the Spanish Flu, sweating sickness, and thousands of other bouts of infectious diseases that came and went - issue still around today. </p>
<p>From an evolutionary perspective, a disease gets no more &quot;points&quot; for infecting humans than it would any other species. The &quot;primary host&quot; for a disease is one which is crucial for its reproduction, and there are plenty of mammalian species in which rabies is not an immediate death sentence, including those who coexist with it without any symptoms at all. </p>
<p>The primary carriers or rabies in the USA are bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes; all of whom are primary hosts for rabies that <em>aren't</em> killed off by the disease. Rabies, apart from the dead-end human hosts, is actually an incredibly successful and adaptable disease, that can infect (and spread) via both warm-and cold-blooded hosts, and has been even artificially spread to avian subjects as well (who aren't killed by it but do remain infected/symptomatic). </p>
<p>In fact, in all other regards, rabies is downright terrifying from a epidemical perspective. It's theorised that it would be capable of spreading as an STD between hypothetically &quot;infected but somehow not dying so quickly&quot; human subjects, as it's been found in both semen and vaginal secretions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The advantage that Rabies has is the time it takes to kill. Once infected, it can take anywhere from a couple of weeks to a whole year before you manifest any symptoms of the disease. Around the time you start showing symptoms, one of the first includes aggression and behavioral changes that facilitate transmission. So, for example, a wolf gets infected somehow. It rejoins its pack. A month later, it bites a few other pack members and infects them as well, but they show symptoms in a staggered order. It also leaves the pack and tries to interact with other animals. </p>
<p>Rabies kills bats just like humans or any other mammal, but there is a gotcha here. The progression of the disease is effectively paused while the bat is hibernating. (during the winter months) The lower body temperature stops the progression. </p>
<p>In other words, you are right that the severity of the illness makes it less likely to survive, but the change in behavior and long incubation time are adaptations to make up for that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, I would think the evolutionary advantage of transmitting itself to another host lies in it's abilities to make the infected irritated enough to bite other living things.  The process of making the host that irritable kills the host but is successful in spreading the infection as rabies has not caused itself to die out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This shit is a real life zombie virus: get infected and you start secreting saliva and fluids that are infective, and start attacking people with those bits.</p>
<p>Rabies evolved to alter behavior through modifying the brain for infectivity. But when you modify the brain, especially as a virus, you're causing permanent damage.</p>
<p>So its lethality is just a <em>side effect</em> of the transmission model of <em>give weapons that are infectious, make crazy and attack others</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
