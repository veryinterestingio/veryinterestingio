Everything I've found either contains irrelevant statistics or research, anecdotal evidence or claims made about statistics/research without any sources. I found one useful source, but it was narrow as far as the form of abuse, and I'm looking for more information about different forms or abuse in general. I've heard arguments for both sides (that victims become abusers and that victims aren't any more likely to become abusers) and I just want to know something approximating the truth. Thank you!</p></div></div>

<p>Look for &quot;cycle of violence&quot;, it'll give you more results, hopefully not all behind walls.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20021103134717/http://www.acadv.org/children.html" target="_blank">Children exposed to domestic violence are likely to develop behavioral problems, such as regressing, exhibiting out of control behavior, and imitating behaviors.</a> Furthermore, <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/4420/chapter/1" target="_blank">children may think that violence is an acceptable behavior of intimate relationships and become either the abused or the abuser</a>. Recent research has questioned whether certain effects of domestic violence exposure on children are moderated and/or mediated by <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0886260511403747" target="_blank">maternal psychological response</a> such as <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00690/full" target="_blank">maternal post-traumatic stress disorder, dissociation</a>, and related biological markers.</p>
