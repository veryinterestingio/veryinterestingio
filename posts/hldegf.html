<p>However, does that take in account if the person is continually exposed to infected people? Is it possible for her/his immune system to get a &quot;memory refresh&quot;? Something like a signal in the body that says &quot;hey, I know you can't remember coronaviruses well but you still need immunity for this&quot;?</p></div></div>

You read that antibody titers drop off after 3 months.  Antibodies drop off after a few months for many viruses.  Memory B cells are responsible for long term immunity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would be very surprised if there's data that immunity only lasts 3 months. You'd have to get a sufficient number of patients who got COVID in March, at the beginning of this wave, and follow them for 3 months and then have a sufficient number get COVID again.  </p>
<p>But if your question, if re-challenge with the immunogenic agent will boost your immunity because it will stimulate your body to make the relevant antibodies and those cells get revved up to fight off the pathogen. If you keep getting exposed to it, you'll keep making antibodies to fight it off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As u/0wlfather pointed out, just because we don't detect antibodies in the blood doesn't mean you aren't immune.  </p>
<p>If you are infected with COVID and recover, you will likely never be infected again.  If you are, it is likely to be a mild case.</p>
<p>In the 11 million+ cases so far of COVID there has not been a single documented case of reinfection.  Nor have there been documented cases of reinfection with SARS or MERS.</p>
<p>Lasting immunity from a vaccine is a different story and we might need to get regular boosters.</p>

<p>Yes, re-exposure (asymptomatic beginnings of re-infection) works as a free &quot;booster vaccine&quot; sort of thing with most infectious diseases (ignore influenza, because it's unusually complex in terms of mutation.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
