		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's their way of transforming into &quot;transportation mode&quot;. When they're small, their moms carry them by the nape of the neck since they can't easily move on their own, they don't necessarily know where they're going, etc. By going fully relaxed like that it makes it easier for the mom to carry them. That instinct carries with them into adulthood, though it's definitely <em>not</em> recommended to do this to adult cats to carry them around since there's more weight and more opportunities for injury.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a bundle of nerves there that release endorphins when pressure is applied. It causes them to go limp for easy carrying when mom needs to move them. This effect can also be seen in horses with use of a lip twitch. (Lip twitch devices are hotly debated in the horse world, personally I’ve just used my hand on my old gelding’s lip when it was time for his dewormer. He haaated dewormer.)</p>
<p>As a lot of others have already said, it’s not good to pick up an adult cat by the scruff, as an adult they are much heavier and their neck isn’t meant to support that kind of weight. You can still grip the scruff firmly with your hand and it should help to release endorphins and calm them down (think: bath time, nail clipping, etc) but only if their weight is fully supported by a table or counter.</p>
<p>Dogs have this same effect with a bundle of nerves at the base of their ears which is why they turn into a puddle of goo with a good ol ear rub.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It's really the best way to move kittens, when you don't have hands and are the size of a cat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
