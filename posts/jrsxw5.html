		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Throughout our evolution, we were at a caloric deficit. So we naturally prioritize calories, not nutrients. It's clearly not optimum, but you can go a long time without certain vitamins/minerals. If you don't have actual calories, not so much...</p>
<p>So high calories food with a lot of fat/sugar taste better to us, especially children who need calories to grow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During most of our evolution, not getting enough calories was far more likely to kill you than not getting enough vitamins, minerals and other nutrients, so we have evolved to enjoy the taste of fatty and sugary foods.</p>
<p>Eating too much sugar and fat wasn't something that killed our ancestors because sugar and fat were very hard to come by.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Partly because people tend to give kids shitty vegetables. I've known parents to give their kid microwaved frozen broccoli with no seasoning and then wondering why they don't like it.   </p>
<p>Compare with kale chips, which kids absolutely love.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Especially children as their sense of taste is far more acute. What can taste mild to us can taste very bitter to a child. Same with spicy foods. Same can happen in adulthood, where some people can't stand the taste of wine even in their twenties but by their thirties or fourties they love it. And why generally stronger varieties of cheese are favoured by older consumers.</p>
<p>But why vegetables specifically, because our caveman brains crave calories first, and only crave vitamins and such when the need is especially strong, like when pregnant women find they have an inexplicable craving, and it can often come down to needing a specific thing from that food, so to them it will smell and taste far better than it might before they became pregnant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have so much highly palatable food around, all the fast food, sweets, chips, etc. Many people who hate veggies start liking them again once they cut out all that junk. Same woth fruit, if you stop eating sweetened stuff, your taste buds become more sensitive to the sweetness of the fruit and it will feel much sweeter than before.</p>
<p>I think another problem is that many people don't know how to properly prepare the foods.</p>
<p>Take spinach for example, so many people hate it because &quot;it's bitter&quot;, well if you only cook for a very short time on low heat it's not bitter at all and actually delicious.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
