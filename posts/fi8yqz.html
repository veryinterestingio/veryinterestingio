		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By the way people still get bubonic plague in some parts of the world, just not in endemic scale. Probably because of sanitation it’s not spread like it used to in Middle Ages. Still it’s not completely eradicated at all.</p>
<p>In general, infectious disease never keeps going forever in high rate, because as soon as number of healthy people drops significantly (due to getting infected, immunity, or death), transmission rate drops. Because there is no more available supply of fresh host to spread to. That’s the reason deadly diseases only comes in sudden waves and die down - not keep going. So the key to control infectious disease is to reduce number of susceptible people by any means. Vaccine, quarantine or getting them all infected all works.</p>
<p>Just want to add: if you want to read up on it, it’s called SIR model (Susceptible-Infected-Removed). It’s basis for all infectious disease models. It’s a bit mathematical though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every talks about the Second Plague Pandemic (which includes the Black Death) but there were three major pandemics in total. </p>
<p>The First Pandemic happened in the 6th and 7th centuries which killed up to 40% of the population of Constantinople and around of the European population. It happened so long ago during a period of scarce historical record in Western Europe that it's now mostly forgotten but it really devastated the Byzantine Empire.</p>
<p>The Second Pandemic began with an epidemic in Mongolia in the 1330s and then it spread to Europe through the Silk Road. The plague was first recorded in Europe in 1347, resulting in a six year period called the Black Death where an estimated 30% to 60% of Europeans died. But the end of the Black Death didn't result in the end of the Second Pandemic as the bacteria became endemic in Europe and continued to cause deadly Bubonic plague epidemics for centuries to come. </p>
<p>In 16th to 17th century Paris there was a major plague outbreaks an average of once every three years. The classic plague doctor outfit wasn't invented until the 1619 and used until 1656. The last major British plague epidemic was the Great Plague of London from 1665-1666 which also spread to the surrounding areas. This resulted Newton sent home from the University of Cambridge and quarantined. 1666 was Newton's annual mirabilis when a bored 23 year old Newton came up with numerous theories and experiments which changed the history of science.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_plague_pandemic" target="_blank">The Third Plague Pandemic</a> lasted from 1855 until 1960 in India and China but didn't really spread to Europe. It caused the death of 12 million people, 10 million in India alone.</p>
<p>Edit: I meant to write annus mirabilis, not annual. At least it didn't get autocorrected to Newton's anus mirabilis which is a whole different ballgame altogether.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Deadly diseases are self regulating. The more deadly a disease is, the faster it <em>burns</em> out. It simply kills it's hosts too fast to spread effectively</p>
<p>Pandemics occur in areas with high concentrations of people. You remove the concentration of people, you remove the pandemic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We learned how the diseases work, and how to slow them down and stop them. This was a gradual process involving a fair amount of trial and error.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/snowcricketarticle.html" target="_blank">John Snow and the Broad Street Pump</a>  is an interesting read about how one guy plotted cases of cholera on a map, deduced that the common factor was a water source, and stopped a cholera outbreak in its tracks by taking the handle off the pump.</p>
<p>There's a lot more to this, of course, but this is ELI5 after all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way I understand it, the deadlier the disease is, the faster it runs out of hosts. The “best” diseases in terms of their own survival are the ones that infect lots of people easily, but don’t kill the host. Those are the ones that stick around long term. With plagues, they kill so many people that they run out of viable hosts. You’re either dead, or you’ve been infected and survived, meaning that you have immunity, or at least resistance to it. So they’re devastating in the short term, but they end up killing themselves off because they kill the environment they need to survive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
