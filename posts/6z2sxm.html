		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Larger sedans -- which are Americans' preferences -- offer similar storage space to smaller hatchbacks, but the benefit of being in a more secure trunk (boot). Americans drive larger vehicles because they cost less (no VAT or other high taxes), taxes/registration is based on broad class (passenger car, truck) rather than engine displacement or other more granular determination. Also, our roads and towns were built for cars, so no tight spaces where small cars are necessary. Now, we're actually seeing small SUVs like Honda CR-V, Nissan Rogue surpass even the most popular sedans in sales, which trades the cargo security for higher driving position and AWD capabilities in bad weather..</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Actually in many parts of the USA, even bigger vehicles (SUVs and pickups) are even <em>more</em> popular than sedans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Speaking as someone who has lived both in the US and the UK, my theory would be that for whatever reason pick up trucks are nowhere near as ubiquitous in the UK as they are in the US, therefore hatchbacks offer considerable advantages over sedans for transporting unwieldy items from time to time such as TV's, stepladders, etc. This was certainly one of my considerations when choosing a vehicle there. Here in the US though almost every family probably has access to a pick up truck for occasional cargo use and therefore sedans for regular use offer advantages such as a quieter operating experience and an ability to lock valuables out of sight in the trunk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm gonna go out on a limb here, but... Way back in the 70's we had the &quot;oil crisis&quot;, and people dumped their big Detroit type cars for small, fuel efficient Japanese ones. There was a HUGE stigma with the WW2 generation that Japanese/Asian products=Cheap crap, and buying Japanese stuff was &quot;un-American&quot; (my Dad is still this way, in 2017 ?) Not many American cars (other than small &quot;economy&quot; cars, and maybe some &quot;sporty&quot; ones the average &quot;family&quot; buyer wouldn't get) were sold here with hatchbacks. Once the economy turned back up and gas prices dropped, anything with a hatchback became the un-cool car you got because you HAD to , and dumped ASAP. Yes there are some people here who actually LIKE hatchbacks, but they're few and far between. Kind of like manual transmission cars, but that's another whole issue... (full disclosure, I've gone out of my way to buy manual trans equipped hatchback cars whenever possible, and have thought about this very issue a lot) </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
