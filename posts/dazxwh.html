		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Getting high&quot; is always subjective. It can be a lot of things. For one, the euphoric feeling a drug gives can lead the user to feel an elevated sense of happiness, among other things. An elevated sense of certain perceptions is a &quot;high&quot;. </p>
<p>Also, if you look at the drugs uptake by the body as a linear graph, it looks somewhat like a mountain. You start at the bottom, then rocket to the top concentration of the drug in your blood (peak), then plateau there for a while. On a linear graph, your plateau is the &quot;highest&quot; you get. Then you come down on the other side.</p>
<p>TLDR: Think of how people feel when at the &quot;high&quot; point in their life. High is associated with positive feelings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty much related to feeling in a better or <em>higher</em> state compared to how you feel normally.</p>
<p>Serotonin is the neurotransmitter that keeps you at that normal/calm state. A deficiency in serotonin can lead to symptoms of depression. Dopamine is the neurotransmitter that makes you high/happy. A deficiency in dopamine can lead to symptoms of Parkinson's.</p>
<p><strong>(this is wrong, I'm leaving it in for those reading)</strong> Because dopamine is the how you feel &quot;high&quot;, it's also contributed to the slang &quot;dope&quot; and &quot;doped up&quot;.</p>
<p>Hope this helped!</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Didn't realize the dopamine/dope slang was wrong. That was something I've heard all of my life and I didn't ever reconsider it. </p>
<p>I know dopamine isn't the prime reason for feeling high in all situations, there are way more chemicals and substances involved in feeling different things. I was mainly thinking about how dopamine is usually the activator. </p>
<p>Sorry for the false information! Read Earl's comment for the accurate answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Occams razoring this one: We call being sad &quot;feeling low&quot;. So being happy would be synonymous with feeling &quot;high&quot; or &quot;floating above the clouds&quot; etc. etc. </p>
<p>Drugs make you happy, thus they make you &quot;high&quot;.</p>
<p>Plus, saying &quot;Hey bro wanna go get happy?&quot; doesn't have the same ring to it. </p>
<p>tl;dr: Its slang.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the everyday ways we talk about our personal feelings use <em>metaphors</em>. This means that we describe things that don't really have a size, or weight, or color, or location, as if they did. It makes things like ideas and feelings easier to describe and compare.</p>
<p>&quot;Being high&quot;, &quot;getting high&quot;, &quot;feeling high&quot; use positions in space as a symbol for an emotion and a state of mind. It matches with the &quot;up and down&quot; way we talk about other ideas/feelings, like happiness (&quot;I'm feeling <em>up</em>. My spirits <em>rose</em>. She always gives me a <em>lift</em>.&quot;), wakefulness (&quot;I got <em>up</em>. I woke <em>up</em>. I <em>fell</em> asleep.&quot;), intensity (&quot;<em>High</em> drama. The <em>height</em> of passion. <em>High</em> activity. <em>High</em> winds and <em>high</em> seas.&quot;), and general positivity (&quot;Things are looking <em>up</em>. We hit a <em>peak</em>.&quot;)</p>
<p>&quot;Being high&quot;, describing a feeling you get from taking certain chemicals, was first used a few hundred years ago, when &quot;high&quot; could also mean &quot;violent, loud&quot; and &quot;uncontrollable&quot;. A good description for someone roaring drunk on gin.</p>
<p>Nowadays, &quot;getting high&quot; is related to orientational metaphors about fantasizing and day-dreaming like &quot;head in the clouds&quot;, &quot;spaced out&quot;, and &quot;down-to-earth&quot;. But it's also connected to spiritual metaphors about awareness like &quot;higher consciousness&quot;.</p>
<p>TLDR: We symbolically describe good moods, intense experiences, uncontrollable activity, the world of fantasy and imagination, and spiritual awareness as &quot;up&quot;. &quot;Getting high&quot; sits nicely among these metaphors and connects these concepts.</p>

<li>A lot of these examples, and the general ideas, are from <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Metaphors_We_Live_By.html?id=r6nOYYtxzUoC" target="_blank">&quot;Metaphors We Live By&quot;</a> by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sadly I don't have the time to do the research necessary to answer this question properly, but I think it's interesting. How did the word for &quot;tall&quot; come to mean &quot;intoxicated&quot;? </p>
<p>Here's what I found: The Online Etymological Dictionary says that &quot;high&quot;, meaning &quot;euphoric or exhilarated from alcohol&quot; is first attested 1620s, and of drugs, 1932. And it says this sense of &quot;high&quot; shares the same etymology as &quot;high&quot; meaning both &quot;physically elevated&quot; and &quot;exalted&quot; (one root, dual meanings). Compare a &quot;high mountain&quot;, a &quot;high priest&quot;. </p>
<p>From there I can only speculate. Given the historical connection between religion and alcohol, my guess would be that this sense of &quot;high&quot; comes from the religious meaning rather than the geographical, but I can't say for certain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
