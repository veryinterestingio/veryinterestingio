		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I cant talk much about sapce engineers but I do understand KSP's optimizations a bit. These isn't much you can do about multiple parts beside maybe fusing some parts together into one for physics purposes (which is done) but we can optimize individual parts a lot as well and this is the biggest approach KSP uses.</p>
<p>One optimization that KSP does it that it pretends other planets don't exist in orbital calculations. Normally in space everything pulls on you, around say earth orbit, the moon will mess with your orbit again, even the sun and jupiter and to a small extent even stars and the black hole in the center of the galaxy. Gravity never goes to zero, it just decreases till near zero. In real space missions, the larger sources of this gravity like jupiter and the moon and sun have to be accounted for but KSP chooses to ignore these for ease of calculation.</p>
<p>This also allows us to do one more optimization rather than just simulating gravity with one object, use conic sections for orbits rather than simulating gravity. In high school you may have learned about conic sections, graphs of circles, ellipses, hyperbolas and parabolas. Turns out gravity with a single point mass simplifies down to this, orbits are generally ellipses and hyperbolas (when on an escape trajectory), circles and parabolas are just specific instances of these. So rather than simulating gravity when orbiting, we just define our orbit as an ellipse and use the equations ellipses to calculate where the object will be at any time we want, simplifying our calculations a lot. Boosting into a new orbit changes the ellipse and we have to calculate what the new equation for the ellipse would be but once we find that, simulating the rest of the trajectory is easy. Rather than having to calculate the next location for every second (we move a second, calculate how much gravity changes our speed, then repeat), we can create equations where we can just plug in a future time and it will give us the location at that time. This is also one difference between KSP's &quot;physics mode&quot; and normal orbital mode when warping, &quot;physics mode&quot; will actually use newton's laws of gravity to calculate location while normal timewarp will just use conic section equations and also treat all connected objects as one thing (and also not calculate rotation since that is hard, you may have noticed timewarping stops all rotation).</p>
<p>Btw if you are interested in real gravity calculations, there exists a mod called Principia which will do these calculations properly using calculus and eulerâ€™s method, it really shows you how much the moon actually messes with orbits irl.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Professional software engineer here, working in games.</p>
<p>Performance costs increase when you have more objects in the scene that need to perform complex interactions with other objects, such as applying physics or occlusion culling.</p>
<p>For rendering in games with user generated content like KSP and Space Engineers, you don't have the luxury of telling a designer how to optimise the scene for better performance. In this case, you rely heavily on things like occlusion culling, LODs, and GPU instancing.</p>
<p>Occlusion culling is the name given to any way of telling what 3D objects will not be visible on screen. Objects that aren't visible get ignored by the game, reducing how much time the game spends running calculations for them. LOD stands for &quot;level of detail&quot;, and is used to show a less detailed version of 3D objects as they get further away from your camera, with the goal of being unnoticeably different. GPU instancing is useful if your scene has many of the same 3D object in it. It's a way of reducing how much information your game needs to send to the GPU, by identifying objects as having the same 3D form and / or the same surface materials. If you have a spaceship with 300 identical thrusters, the game could send full information about all 300 thrusters to your GPU... Or it could send information about just one thruster, and then say &quot;by the way, this same object appears in these 300 places&quot;. It's a massive time save!</p>
<p>There's a ton more optimisation that goes on for improving the performance of 3D rendering, but these are some of the bigger ones.</p>
<p>For physics with user generated content, you have a whole host of challenges. The biggest runtime costs you'll run into with physics is when moving objects through a complex scene - ie one with lots of objects very close to each other. This cost occurs with or without having simulation (ie the ability to be shoved around) enabled for the objects, and is purely due to the physics engine keeping track of the overlaps between different objects.</p>
<p>Another big cost can occur when needing to simulate many objects, when they're all hitting each other in close proximity. </p>
<p>The first big optimisation is often to have designers create simplified invisible 3D versions of the visible 3D objects, using spheres, capsules, boxes, and (more often) convex meshes. These simplified objects perform much better in physics engines than the visible 3D geometry would, because the engine can make a number of assumptions about their shape to speed up calculations. </p>
<p>Another big optimisation is setting up your objects so the physics engine knows only specific objects can ever interact with other specific objects.</p>
<p>For example, most games approximate the player with a vertical capsule shape, and this capsule represents where the player can physically move in the world. If the capsule doesn't fit, the player won't be able to go through.</p>
<p>But at the same time, the player would expect, say, the character's body to interact with the scene, for example letting their foot kick a cardboard box out of the way while running. In this case, the cardboard box interacts in no way whatsoever with the player's capsule, so designers can set the two objects up so the physics engine knows this. It will then never run into the cost of checking if the cardboard box and player capsule are overlapping. This is done <em>a lot</em> in videogames, and players are often none the wiser. For another example, think of shields in Overwatch. Players can pass through them, but explosive projectiles and bullets can't.</p>
<p>Finally, another optimisation can come from carefully attaching solid objects to each other, so that moving one object will pull the rest after it, as though they're made of one piece of solid, inflexible material. This tells the physics engine that these objects can be treated as one big object instead of many small ones, which saves many calculations. Once the object gets hit by something with enough force, the game can be designed so the object breaks, giving the player the illusion that it was made up of many smaller, individual parts all along.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The majority of games tend to simply not allow many moving parts, to avoid this exact issue, and prevent players from making things that could cause this sort of issue. The more &quot;things&quot; you add to a game world, the worse the game will perform, simple as that!</p>
<p>If you add a new physics object, it can potentially interact with every other already existing physics object, and they all have to &quot;talk&quot; to each other to see if they're colliding. So to optimise this sort of game, you make that &quot;talking&quot; as simple as possible, and make each &quot;part&quot; as simple as possible in terms of data</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Moving parts are difficult to handle efficiently. Some programs do some levels of optimization by utilizing things like bounding boxes to at least provide a quick and simple check to see if any two things need have even a remote possibility of colliding. If the bounding boxes would overlap in the next frame, then more detailed calculations may be made to see if the things actually intersect.</p>
<p>Another improvement along similar lines clusters items that are geographically close to each other. That way you only need to check collisions within your cluster since anything outside would be too far to have a chance to intersect.</p>
<p>Now, both of these optimizations break down if you have a lot of small, moving parts all close to each other (such as with a modular spaceship). It becomes harder to find quick and easy checks when in any given frame, things might start to intersect and collide.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>BTW, these games not only optimize for performance, but also for precision. Game engines use floats to save position of objects. Problem is, they get less precise the larger they are. Everything is fine for the most part, but anything over 10km gets janky really fast and the whole game just melts.
Thats why in KSP the dont move the player, but everything else. Some other games just teleport everything back when you get too far.
This way everything stays close to 0 where everything is precise. I think this is also really cool.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
