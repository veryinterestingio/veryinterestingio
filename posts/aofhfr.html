<p>Just because at point X in time no people are sick, doesnt mean that there are no carriers of the virus or items/places with viruses or bacteria on them. Someone goes exploring a ruined castle, or visits an old demolished house, or comes in contact with a rat that came in contact with something from an old area etc etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Other diseases preventable in humans may have other hosts that can re-infect humans even if the disease is supposedly eradicated.  The lesson:  ever vigilant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason we managed to eliminate small pox (like it's extinct GO HUMANS) is more due to luck regarding the nature of the virus. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Small pox had two really nice (perspective is important) properties:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>1)  Carriers did not exist. This meant that if you contracted small pox, you would show symptoms. The symptoms of small pox were (past tense WOOOO) so distinct that you could quickly identify an outbreak and react with mass vaccinations. Since you could easily identify everyone who had the disease you can isolate and treat. This is not the case with many other childhood diseases. For example, Polio in 90+% of cases manifests as a fever and other non-descript symptoms. Fevers are common to many many illnesses so it takes longer to figure out what is going on. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>2) Small pox only infected humans. This one is huge. If only humans can be infected, than you can ensure that all sources of the virus are contained. It's much much harder to stop a disease or virus from spreading when mice, birds. and other animals can carry the virus, get on a ship and spread it elsewhere. This is actually the main reason why rabies is still a thing. We have a super effective way to prevent the onset of symptoms (and certain death) but we can't control all the vectors (bats, dogs, raccoons) so it's still a thing we need to be aware of.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Lots of underdeveloped countries in Asia and Africa don't have vaccines for things like polio and thus people are still contracting and transmitting them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
