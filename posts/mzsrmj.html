		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can, as long as it's &quot;everyday people&quot; sums. You don't have to launder $2K. But if it's millions, people will get suspicious about how you can afford the stuff you buy, no matter how you buy it. And then you better have a plausible explanation, which is exactly what laundering aims to create.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because if the money isn't laundered and the government starts realizing you suddenly own a mansion and a dozen Ferraris, and your tax returns for the last five years say you earned $20,000 as a janitor, then there are going to be some <em>serious</em> questions about where the money came from.</p>
<p>Extreme example of course but that's the general idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you only use the dirty money to buy groceries or clothing, then it won't matter. You will probably want to buy a house or a car, if you have all that money. The person or business selling them to you will be reluctant to accept cash for such a large transaction. Hence, you will have to deposit it. If you deposit all that cash at once, it will raise a flag to the IRS, who will know, from your past income tax reports, that you do not make that much money.  They will investigate to see if you have been withholding money from the Government, or if you are involved in shady businesses. As a matter of fact, the bank manager will be requesting proof of origin of the money, unless they are crooked, too. The bank can get into trouble if they aid in money laundering.</p>
<p>Edit: another Redditor confirmed that the deposits are reported to FinCen, not to the IRS.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Say you have $30k a year &quot;legal&quot; income and $100k additional illegal income. </p>
<p>Do you want to live a life like a $30k person, or a $130k person?</p>
<p>If you want to present as the latter, you need to convince the state you're legally earning that money, hence laundering.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
