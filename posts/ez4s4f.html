But every now in then on reddit, i see animal such as birds, snakes, gekkos, and even a platypus being petted by humans.
Do all/most animal enjoys it? Or are they just letting it happen out of fear?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On the one hand, it’s a bonding experience. In most mammals, the mum grooms her babies, and you grooming your pet is similar to that experience.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you can scratch places they can’t and that is precious. Ever try to massage the outside of your dogs ear? Most of them go absolutely nuts. Scratch a horse on the back or withers and they go crazy as well.</p>
<p>Edit since several people asked: the withers is the bony part on a horses back between the shoulder blades, at the base of the mane</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if this helps out very much, but I watched a documentary recently that had some photographers that were taking photos of sharks. They had built up a relationship with these sharks over the years and the sharks love being petted. They will swim away and then come back for more and they recognize the divers, even if they are in different dive suits every time. (All of this is according to what I saw on said documentary)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
