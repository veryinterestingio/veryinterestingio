		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there are two types of immune responses </p>
<p>There’s your antibodies floating around. These tend to dwindle over time and you can have a decreased immunity </p>
<p>There are however also memory cells. Where even though your antibodies dwindle they will produce more antibodies in response to the invader. </p>
<p>They make it more likely that your will have a less severe infection. But there is no guarantee. </p>
<p>This is also complicated by the fact not all the symptoms of COVID are from the virus itself but are due to an over reaction of the bodies immune system. This is why we give medications like dexamethasone to prevent inflammation in the lungs that makes them stiff and hard to ventilate. </p>
<p>TLDR. You’re less likely to be as sick. But no guarantee.</p>
<p>Edit: some bad grammar</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's best to go on large collected data, from places like the UK and Israel.</p>
<p>The UK says reinfections are still low but when they do happen, generally the viral loads are lower which could imply lesser the second time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveycharacteristicsofpeopletestingpositiveforcovid19uk/28july2021" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveycharacteristicsofpeopletestingpositiveforcovid19uk/28july2021" target="_blank">https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveycharacteristicsofpeopletestingpositiveforcovid19uk/28july2021</a></a></p>
<p>That would agree with the studies in the past, like the US Marines study, where the second infections were asymptomatic, with less viral loads.</p>
<p>You'll get plenty of people in this thread who say more severe the second time for prior infections and cite small studies (with less than 20 people etc), but that is not being seen when wide scale data is collected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Please take some of the below answers with a grain of salt - Covid-19 is still a relatively new virus and we understand relatively little on its mutation processes and their impact on immune efficiency.</p>
<p>We know that some viruses are so seasonal that you need a new vaccination every year to have a good cover against newly mutated variants, and some are so stable genetically that a single vaccination gives complete lifelong cover.</p>
<p>All in all, science does so far NOT have a conclusive answer how well a successfully recovered Covid-19 illness will protect you from its future strains (which very likely will emerge). So far it seems like second infections tend to be milder on average (see other posts for lonks to studies), but the hope for a full immunity seems baseless too, unfortunately.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
