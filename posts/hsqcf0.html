		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few comments on this (for background, I'm a research scientist.  I got an MLS years back, but do not currently work in the field).  In my experience with the program, there is a lot of specialized training that goes into librarianship.  I personally think that a bachelor's degree could prepare people for work as a librarian, but I think the major issue is that there are a lot of variations and specializations within the career which could mean it is to people's advantage to have more background.  A law librarian is different from a university librarian from a community librarian, and most master's programs allow this kind of focus.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is that - not every staff member you run into in a community library is a librarian.  Many tasks might be handled by other staff, while some of the complicated things around managing the collection, selecting information systems, etc are handled by librarians.</p>
<p>Finally, I also think that the requirement is driven a bit by the value that the profession places on education culturally.  Like - if you look other fields, like education and law, maybe you could have a person who has self-studied and has the right personality be very good at the job, but the profession itself values the fact that the knowledge has been acquired through formal education.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are loads of jobs that require a lot of training and don't pay that well. Professional musicians can be extremely talented having spent years training. PhDs become college lecturers with pay similar to librarians and high school teachers. People don't always train for the highest paying job they can get. They train for a job they want. If it pays enough to get by and they enjoy going to work then it was worth it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What I don't see mentioned in this thread is the fact that the American Library Association accredits MLIS programs, and in the US, if you want to be a traditional librarian, you must go to a school that has an accredited ALA master's program. There is a lot of internal debate about the MLIS--but to me, what it comes down to, is bureaucracy.</p>
<p>I work as a data librarian/consultant. I help businesses and federal agencies manage their information by improving metadata, search applications, and help them towards advanced semantic capabilities. Essentially I evaluate business value, how users interact with information, how they perceive their information, how systems use that information, and what they wish their information could do. All of which I learned in my MLIS by taking classes on information architecture, metadata management, user experience design, and information behavior. It's a mix of technology skills, an understanding how way information is structured, awareness of ongoing trends in a wide variety of fields, and psychology--this is true in traditional librarianship as well. We have to be IT, a teacher, a consultant, a counselor, all in one.</p>
<p>Many businesses today are recognizing what librarians bring to data/information management. Amazon for instance has a whole team of librarians who manage the entire product catalog, making sure the data structures (search and browse) are in place so shoppers can find the products they need, while also helping AI make better recommendations. They require an MLIS, or a MSIS, for this position--it's possible to get this job without the degree, but usually having the MLIS puts you at the front of the line. Librarians have been creating these information structures (catalogues, subject headings, controlled vocabularies) and making recommendations for a very long time, long before the internet. Librarians are also heavily involved with the W3C that helps maintain internet standards.</p>
<p>Is a master's degree required for this? Well, it's hard to say--there are so many different librarians that do vastly different things. Law librarians (who usually also must have a JD), medical librarians (who usually also must have a medical degree of some sort), corporate librarians, digital preservationists, internet librarians, rare manuscripts librarians. But the core theory and practice of what we do in this field can be slimmed down to two years of graduate study--and I'd say the core thing we do is  connect people to accurate, higher quality information, especially when the person doesn't know how to actually search for whatever it is they need. This sounds simple and like Google should have it covered, but it is actually a complex problem to solve--besides, Google doesn't care about the quality of the information it puts in front of you. It just cares about what you and other people like you have clicked on before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
