		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no centre or origin point of the big bang.</p>
<p>This misconception springs from people having a concept of the big bang being a lot of matter forced into some known point in 3D space which then expands out. In fact, it is the entire of 3D space that is compacted and then expands.</p>
<p>If I put a few pennies on a grid with 1cmx1cm squares in some configuration, then the 1 cm grid turns into a 5 cm grid, there is no centre of expansion, there is no reference point, everything just gets more spaced apart. If you could shrink yourself down and stand on one of the pennies it would simply appear as if everything had moved away from you and this would be true no matter what penny you stood on.</p>
<p>This is how the expansion of the universe (and the big bang) works.</p>
<p>We see CMB radiation in all directions simply because the big bang is in all directions. Not long after the big bang, our own area of the universe was nothing but CMB radiation too, this evolved and emitted light out towards other areas of the universe, the CMB we detect now comes from far reaches of the observable universe which will have also evolved in the 13B years since and will now be full of stars and galaxies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

All of the universe expanded out from that point. You can't look in a direction and say the Big Bang happened there, it happened everywhere.</p>
<p>Imagine that you have a tiny balloon. Now blow the balloon up. Can you point to the spot on the balloon where it started? No, it happened everywhere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The universe was very small when the Big Bang happened - like you said, a single point. When it happened, it happened 'everywhere' in the whole universe.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is still true. It's weird, but the universe isn't expanding 'into' anything. It might be easier to imagine it like a marble instead of a 'point', with everything inside this marble -- even space itself -- shrinking over time while the marble itself stays the same size. Where did the Big Bang happen? It filled the whole marble. Even today, it still filled the whole marble, it's just that things seem further apart on the inside. But if you chose any point in the marble and looked around, the Big Bang would still be everywhere in the marble.  </p>
<p>And, wherever you look, you'll still see the edges of the marble (the CMB) - but the more time goes on, the further away the edges will seem.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In reality, we can't see the *actual* edges of the marble and it might not even actually have any 'edges' the way a physical marble might. We can only see just-so-many lightyears away in any given direction - and this is true *everywhere*. So no matter where you look, the CMB is about the same distance, and everywhere looks like (and, because of the way the Big Bang happened in the whole marble, basically is) the centre. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's weird, but I suppose many things about the 'fringe cases' of reality are!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cosmic background radiation <em>is</em> that single point where the universe started. The cosmic background radiation above you, below you, and to the left and right of you, were all touching in the moment before the big bang.  All of those are the same &quot;point&quot; at the start of the expansion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially the CMB is the 'first' photons we can see, chronologically, after the Big Bang. The first 330,000 or so years after the Big Bang, everything was opaque to radiation; photons were interacting with the medium far too frequently for any of them to be able to travel freely over long distances. After 330,000 years, recombination happened (electrons and protons formed hydrogen nuclei) and <em>only then</em> could photons travel freely. The CMB is the relic of this earliest time.</p>
<p>The reason we see the CMB everywhere and uniformly is because </p>
<p>1) 330,000 years after the Big Bang, the Universe was no longer a point but a pretty sizeable object, and</p>
<p>2) In the time since these photons were first emitted, space has expanded. The expansion has 'thinned out' the density of CMB photons (which were distributed pretty uniformly across the universe at recombination), resulting in them being visible everywhere. The other consequence of the expansion is that they have been redshifted to lower and lower energies. Eventually the expansion will render the CMB practically unobservable.</p>
<p>There's no real preferred direction for the CMB. Everywhere we look it appears to be uniform. There's also no specific direction we can look to 'see' the Big Bang. Any direction will do, and you can't see back further than recombination.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
