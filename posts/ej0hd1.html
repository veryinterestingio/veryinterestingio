		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are different types of hearing aid, because different parts of the ear could be damaged or defective.</p>
<p>If you look at <a href="https://www.bksv.com/-/media/Images/Waves/2018/01_Anatomy-of-the-human-ear/Anatomy-of-the-human-ear_01.ashx?h=552&amp;w=875&amp;la=en&amp;hash=CA79680318C10B80E2A4343E8BEA13934C861455" target="_blank">the diagram</a>, the eardrum vibrates with the sounds in air, but that vibration is transmitted via bones to the cochlea, which is a chamber filled with liquid and soft hairs that are attached to nerves.</p>
<p>So if every piece of the ear anatomy is &quot;ok&quot;, then the hearing aid can just amplify the sounds so they vibrate the eardrum a bit harder.</p>
<p>Otherwise, an implanted type of hearing aid could pick up the sounds via a microphone, and apply the vibration directly to the bones (if the eardrum is ruptured).  Or, with a <a href="https://cdn.prod-carehubs.net/n1/802899ec472ea3d8/uploads/2016/10/a-medical-illustration-of-a-cochlear-implant-original.jpg" target="_blank">cochlear implant</a>, the sounds picked up by the electronics are applied directly into the liquid environment inside the cochlea, bypassing the eardrum and the bones completely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For starters, I work as an Engineer for one of the largest hearing aid manufacturers in the world, although in the Quality &amp; Regulatory Affairs side of things, so I'm not as well-versed as a member of R&amp;D would be.</p>
<p>I'll cover the second point first, Power and Super Power hearing aids intended for those who have severe and profound hearing loss can be amplified to the extent where they would cause damage to those without hearing loss or with moderate loss.</p>
<p>As such, any hearing aid should always be programmed by a hearing care professional (audiologists and hearing aid dispensers in the UK) prior to issue, as they ensure that the hearing aid is programmed on safe settings.  DO NOT buy hearing aids via mail order or over the internet, as the face-to-face consultation and fine tuning is essential for ensuring safety and maximising performance/troubleshooting.</p>
<p>Effectively, your hearing doesn't get damaged because the only time a hearing aid should put out potentially damaging volumes is at frequencies where the damage has already been done. </p>
<p>As part of your hearing aid fitting the HCP (Hearing Care Professional) will perform a hearing test, which produces an audiogram detailing your hearing loss at various frequencies, typically up to 8 kHz.  This audiogram is then used to determine which hearing aids (if any) are suitable for your hearing loss - typically the less severe your hearing loss, the more options you have as the smaller, custom instruments typically produce less powerful outputs.</p>
<p>If you are getting an off-the-shelf hearing aid, either called a behind-the-ear (BTE) or receiver in-the-ear/canal (RITE/RIC) with no custom ear mould this can be fitted to you the same day as your test, but if a custom hearing aid or mould is chosen there's usually a 1-3 week turnaround for the aid/mould to be manufactured.</p>
<p>When the finished product is available the HCP will program the device to suit your hearing loss - in broad terms it will amplify frequencies which you don't hear well and leave frequencies which you can hear un-amplified, which is why another person's hearing aid won't work for you.  Newer hearing aids also perform frequency transposition, where high frequencies (such as the letter &quot;S&quot;) that patients can't hear well, or at all, are changed to a lower frequency to allow them to hear it.</p>
<p>In crowded rooms basic hearing aids in a pair will also evaluate the sound that you are hearing to allow you to focus on a single person. This is typically done by determining if both hearing aids are receiving speech at the same volume, as that indicates that you are facing the source of the speech. When this occurs the rear microphones are made quieter to allow you to focus on the person you are facing. </p>
<p>More advanced hearing aids will scan the room hundreds of times per second to allow speech from all around you to be cleaned up and give a more realistic experience in a crowded room.  </p>
<p>On top of that you have bluetooth functionality, connectivity to phones, TVs, mobiles, FM adapters (primarily in schools), but they don't have any real effect on the basic functionality of the aid.</p>
<p>Please note, this is a very simple take on a really complicated subject, so there may be sections which aren't 100% correct, but are worded in a way to make it easy to understand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Person who has hearing aids here. In terms of damage there is one thing that bothers me the most because nobody told me that even though It makes sense. Your hearing without them gets worse and worse which is the thing that hit me the most. I think It's because your ears are happy that they don't have to work hard and because of the extra help they don't need to make their job. (That's at least how I got told the reason)</p>
<p>Edit: reason is NOT true at all and was just too simplified.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Am hearing aid user.</p>
<p>Good hearing aids amplify high, low, and in-between sounds exactly as much as they need to make a person's hearing normal. I have hearing loss that effects high sounds, so my hearing aids pump up mostly high pitched sounds that mix with real sound.</p>
<p>Most hearing aids max out at certain volumes. Mine stop at 107 decibels, which is around when sound can hurt someone's hearing. If someone needs sound to be louder than that to correct their hearing, they need to get something other than hearing aids (cochlear implant). If real sound is louder than 107 decibels, my hearing aids do nothing. If real sound is 106 decibels, but my hearing aids are supposed to add 10, they only add 1, because they won't go over 107.</p>
<p>This is good, because only one part of my hearing is broken. There are four steps to hearing: the ear drum, the ear bones, the hearing nerves, and the listening brain. My damage is in the hearing nerves. If sound is too loud, I can still damage my ear bones, and I have. I used to think &quot;I'm broken, so I don't need earplugs!&quot; and didn't wear them when I should have, and hurt my ear bones, which made my hearing worse.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen a professional musician mixing board, with all the levers and nobs? A good hearing aid has those same nobs, but all computerized. A good hearing aid doctor is called an audiologist, and will tune a hearing aid to be perfect for someone's hearing damage.</p>
<p>There aren't that many laws in the United States about hearing aids, so you don't have to be an audiologist to sell them, and you can sell bad hearing aids. There are places where non-doctors sell hearing aids that just blast everything really loudly. They are not good, but they are also cheap. I would not recommend then.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
