		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This process is called &quot;terracing&quot; and is useful for explaining how crystals grow. </p>
<p>ELI5: Lets say you have a bunch of rigid boxes with sides 2m long. They are currently sitting around outside and your boss wants you to pack them into a room. Initially, it will be easier for you to just put them each on the ground next to each other (instead of getting out the forklift and lifting each one on top of another). </p>
<p>Eventually, when the room fills up, you will be forced to walk on top of the first layer and put the boxes down on top. In this way, you grow 1 layer at a time, but the horizontal direction is always preferred over the vertical one. If you have a big room (like lets say the entire sky), you will always prefer to put the boxes on the ground level and you end up with a big flat shape made up of many boxes. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Snowflakes are not really flat, they grow much faster outward than in thickness.</p>
<p>This has to do with the way water is formed into ice. The smallest little bit of ice you can possibly make is a flat sheet. It looks like a hexagon.</p>
<p>The outer areas of that hexagon touch water droplets in the sky, and those places where it touches, grows the little bit of ice a little bit more.</p>
<p>As the snowflake grows, it grows roughly the same in all the places where it can grow. Due to shape of the littlest bit of ice, there are more places to grow outward, than to grow in thickness. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there are a lot of factors apparently, temperature and atmospheric conditions mainly, that affect how the snowflake forms. When a flat snowflake forms it's due to the fact that the flake grows out more readily than up (like a plate instead of a column). As it grows outward, it compounds the effect to grow outward even more quickly because it's easier for new ice to accumulate on the edges than in the middle. So basically, whichever direction it starts to form it continues forming in that direction. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I can gather the tiny building blocks (ice molecules) that make up a snowflake are flat. Their shape is a hexagon and they join up at the edges as the snowflake grows. As the snowflake gets bigger it does increase in thickness as well but apparently due to that hexagonal outward growth, it will always seem far flatter than growing at all dimensions.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>TLDR: The building blocks are flat, it grows along this flatness, so it ends up being mostly flat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
