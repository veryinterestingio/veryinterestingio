Basically I was wondering what the effects of highly pathogenic types of bird flu is on wild bird populations. Does it have significant ecological effects? I am mainly interested in this as it seems that the HPAI variants seem to have originated from domestic bird populations (or so I have been told).</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>H5N8 bird flu has varying mortality rates among different birds, from 5% in some species to 39% in others</p>
<p>The effect of the bird flu among wild populations is theoretically similar to the effect it will have in humans if it becomes transmissible which is to say it kills them by the thousands</p>
<p>Birds have fewer tools to help them fight pandemics, and humans cull them en masse to make sure it never evolves enough to spread to us</p>
<p>Even still, with fewer regulations on bird farms and fewer wild spaces for birds we may yet see a human transmissible bird flu and another human pandemic</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally, avian influenza (AI) has relatively mild effects on wild bird populations - they are often the ones blamed as asymptomatic carriers that introduce it into domestic poultry.  Typical symptoms, if any, include mild diarrhea.</p>
<p>HPAI circulates in wild bird populations and then finds its way into domestic poultry, where it can cause symptoms ranging from mild to severe, including sudden death, GI and/or respiratory signs, and even neurologic disease.  We generally don't vaccinate against AI in domestic poultry, because it can make it difficult to separate infected from vaccinated animals out, and vaccinated animals can still transmit AI.  For that reason, we have widescale culling whenever HPAI is found in developed parts of the world.</p>
<p>One issue has been finding that direct trail from wild birds to domestics, however.  There was a study that looked at H5/N2 variants in the midwest United States during the 2014/2015 outbreak, and while they could find loads of it in domestic chickens, it was almost non-existent in wild birds/waterfowl.</p>
<p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/avian-flu-confirmed-1800-migratory-birds-found-dead-in-himachal-7132933/" target="_blank">A recent outbreak in India caught my eye</a>, because we don't commonly see this high of a mortality in waterfowl.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not very bad for wild populations of birds since most species are natural carriers. The problem is with domestic birds such a as chickens cause they are a lot more vulnerable to the bird flu. At least that's what they told us in vet school. They also told us to keep chickens separated from other bird species such as turkeys for example, cause they can also be carriers of the virus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not called a ‘bird flu’, but another viral agent, West Nile, has decimated some North American bird species.  Blue jays were very common in the Midwest when I was growing up, but are almost unseen these days due to West Nile.  The population is rebounding slightly, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

But to answer your question, LPAI strains can circulate in wild populations with subclinical effects. Most often a LPAI will mutate into a HPAI, especially when jumping species. From what I’ve learned, rarely does HPAI effect wild birds. It’s mostly when it jumps over into commercial chicken does it seem to cause problems. Most often manifest with respiratory clinical signs plus diarrhea and very high mortalities.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
