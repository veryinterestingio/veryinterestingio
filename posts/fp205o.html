		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s in principle possible. It’s not the same as a nanotube or as graphite as others are saying (graphite is less well defined but in principle is multiple graphene sheets, probably with lots of defects). If you were to make such a wire, you’d have to get electrons in and out through the exposed edges because graphene is insulative through-plane. Carbon doesn’t bond to metals very well so you’d have a hard time making the electrical connections without some sort of chemistry at those exposed edges. Such a wire would be very highly conductive since you’d be tapping into the intrinsically high graphene conductivity.</p>
<p>Edit: typo
Edit 2: others are saying there is nonzero through-plane conductivity in graphene. I was under the impression that measurements demonstrating that were due to film defects (like if you have a hole in the graphene, an electron can get into the exposed edges). However, again, I’m not an expert in this field, I’ve just dabbled in the literature for various reasons from time to time over the past 20 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scientist with 1.5 year Postdoctoral research experience in graphene (+PhD in graphene thin films) chiming in.</p>
<p>First, I want to address a few wrong information given here. Graphene sheets are not insulating perpendicular to the plane but significantly less conductive then electron flow in parallel plane of graphene. In order to call something insulating it has to have much higher resistivity then graphene's perpendicular conductance. </p>
<p>If you roll graphene, you could get carbon nanotubes. I have seen papers that form graphene sheets from CNTs and vice versa. But if you are scrolling graphene over and over again, you are forming something different. What you form will likely be highly conductive like graphene. But this is a whole structure scrolled. So, your inner layers are not creating additional electron pathways in parallel. Point is, the inner layers may not contribute as much to the conductance. Imo, you could get similar conductive performance if you could roll graphene around a flexible insulator. This way you wouldn't waste material.</p>
<p>Since there will be electron travel between layers (graphene is not insulating parpendicular to the plane remember.), you cannot use such structure for higher bandwidth and such. And if it could work that way, it would do better so for multiwall CNTs which have discrete inner layers.</p>
<p>Now, because the whole structure is rolled, interactions between rolled layers could cause interesting, unforeseen properties. May be it would make an interesting paper if someone drafted a simulation for it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Basically you would get something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_nanotube#Multi-walled" target="_blank">Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes</a> (MWCNT) and graphite (which is basically multilayered graphene) in term of properties. Probably some more exotic properties as well.</p>
<p>There is a paper who did a theoretical study on rolled up graphene <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/ra/c5ra27789b#!divAbstract" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />
Basically they saw that the armchair-type nanoscrolls can be semiconductors or metallic depending on the chirality number (i.e. how it was rolled up exactly), which is also what people observe in Nanotubes as well.</p>
<p>Note that a spiral structure like a scroll is probably meta-stable, and that is why we observe concentric MWCNTs rather than spiral shaped nano-sheets. I suspect that even IF you could manage to roll the graphene into a spiral, it would turn into a MWCNTs with internal cross-links.</p>
<p>Note also that the &quot;super-high&quot; Graphene mobility (1,000,000 more conductive than copper) occurs only in very pure and defect free films, that is why reports of graphene mobilities vary widely in scientific papers. </p>
<p>As soon as you start messing with the monolayer structure, you are going to lose that super high mobility , since various layers of the spiral interact with each other like in graphite (which is basically multi-layered graphene)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also to make even a wire as thin as a human hair it would be incredibly difficult (= impossible at our current tech level we cannot even make large area defect-free graphene yet).</p>
<p>It's basically much much MUCH cheaper and easier to use copper or silver, even if they conduct less.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you managed to do this to a macroscopic thickness (like you'd need for a wire), then the curvature from the rolling should not matter and you'd essentially just have a very large number of stacked graphene sheets. Since that's what graphite is, I would guess this construction would have similar properties to graphite.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly you actually can fold graphene sheets over themselves, at least in principle. And the exact way in which you fold it will actually determine whether or not the material has a bandgap, or in other words whether it will act as a metal or a semiconductor. This is essentially caused by imposing periodic boundary conditions which will create “subbands”  of occupation.  </p>
<p>There’s much more detail of course, but at a high level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
