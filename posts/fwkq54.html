		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main difference here is that fission is a chain-reaction, and fusion on earth is not.  Fission doesn't need anything to keep itself going, the moment you stop forcing fusion to occur, it instantly stops.   The ONLY self-sustaining fusion reactions are stars.</p>
<p>If I take a lump of enriched Uranium of Fuel grade or above, ( Fuel Grade is &gt;3% U235 ), and place enough of it in one place nuclear fission occurs.  </p>
<p>This is because U235 is fissionable.  What this means is that when struct by a neutron the nucleus will split, any release MORE neutrons.   If the reactor is slow Critical ( at a dollar, or 1.00 fission are caused by each previous fission ) this means that the reaction is self-sustaining.  Each fission creates both a TON of energy ( ~200MeV ), as well as creating on average ~2.4 Neutrons eventually.    <a href="https://ieer.org/resource/factsheets/basics-nuclear-physics-fission/" target="_blank">IEEE Basics of Nuclear Fission </a></p>
<p>This means all the nuclear power station has to do is monitor the fission rate, and most importantly not allow the Criticalality metric ( the k factor ) to increase.  The worst possible case here is the Reactor going &quot;prompt Critical.&quot;  This is where each fission events nutrons released on the initial fission event are enough to cause another fission event.  Here the time scales for exponential growth are on the order if micro-seconds.  That is why nuclear reactors only use delayed neutron criticality, and nuclear bombs are prompt critical.  <a href="https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/751136" target="_blank">Controlling this is THE most important thing for safety, as the basics of Criticality shows</a>, but fundamentally the reaction doesn't need us.  Just dump enough uranium metal together and your reactor works ( it will just kill you ).</p>
<p>Lets compare this to fusion.  Each fusion reaction in an earth reactor combines Deuterium or Tritium, two heavy isotopes of hydrogen.  ( For Proton-Proton fusion grab a solar panel ).  The reactor here is unbelievably hard to do as the nucleates of each atom need to be brought close enough to overcome the Electromagnetic repulsion of the 2 Positively charged protons.   <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/NucEne/fusion.html" target="_blank">A basic overview of the fusion reacion is here.</a> If are able to get these atoms to fuse,  you get energy, but what you don't get is the next step. The next two Hydrogen isotopes will be just as hard to fuse as the last 2.  This means the nuclear reactor has to fight FOREVER.  The reaction does not self-sustain.</p>
<p>This means each fusion reactor has to create the incredibly difficult temperatures and pressures needed to force the Hydrogen isotopes together, AND extract the energy.</p>
<p>The moment you stop forcing this reaction, fusion ends.  Unless you have enough hydrogen to form a STAR fusion is not self-sustaining.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're completely different problems to solve. Neutron-induced fission reactions can happen in self-sustaining chain reactions, you just have to have controls in place to keep the system exactly critical.</p>
<p>In simple terms, a fission reactor core is just a bunch of fuel put close enough together to go critical, with some controllable absorbing material to control the criticality (as well as heat rejection, redundant safety measures, etc.). But you're basically just piling up a bunch of fissile fuel and various other materials, initiating a chain reaction, and letting it go on its own.</p>
<p>Fusion reactors are a completely different technology than fission reactors. There's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawson_criterion" target="_blank">condition</a> that needs to be met in order for a fusion reactor to reach ignition, and it boils down to the product of the density and the confinement time being greater than some minimum value. So you have to find a way to confine a very high-temperature plasma, with as high a density as possible, for as long as possible, and that's a hard thing to do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It turns out the sun uses a relatively rare quantum tunneling event in the core to fuse at lower temperatures and gets around this problem with the raw number of particles interacting. We can't use the same method so have to apply massive amounts of energy to get particles to fuse. You then have the problem of containment of a plasma at millions of degrees and a reactor that damages itself over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
