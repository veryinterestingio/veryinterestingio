		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>My name is Wray Gabel, I'm a Masters student at the University of Florida advised by Dr. Peter Frederick.</p>
<p>A little about my research--my thesis explores the mutualistic relationship between nesting wading birds and the American Alligator. Basically, wading birds get protection from nest predators (like racoons) and alligators get food from discarded nestlings. I'm looking to 1) better understand what alligators might be getting out of the deal and 2) how this mutualism might be changing wading bird colony location preferences when alligators are not around. I conducted my field work for part 1) in the Everglades and used existing wading bird colony location data from North and South Carolina for part 2).</p>
<p>A little about me--I actually grew up wanting to become a paleontologist, which was really what ignited my passion for field work and biology, but ultimately I found currently existing animals to be more fun than rocks. </p>
<p>I got my undergrad degree in Biology from Skidmore College, and after graduating I worked with seabirds in Japan (Hokkaido University), wading birds/waterbirds in San Francisco (San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory), and seabirds in Maine (Audubon's Project Puffin). </p>
<p>I'm mainly interested in the conservation of coastal and wetland ecosystems and hope to do something with wading bird, waterbird, and/or seabird monitoring in my future career as a wildlife biologist. I also minored in Studio Art while at Skidmore and plan to create an illustrated version of my thesis, and I'll be attending an Art-Science residency this fall! I've always been passionate about bridging the (artificial) divide between the two disciplines.</p>
<p>In what little spare time I have I enjoy hiking, traveling, playing video games/board games/rpgs, listening to/collecting music, and doing crossword puzzles!</p>
<p>I am doing this as part of an AMA series with the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UFIFASWildlife/" target="_blank">UF/IFAS Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation</a>. I'll be on at noon (ET, 16 UT), AMA!</p></div></div>

<p>Or is all that what mutualism is?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Since alligators and crocodiles overlap in range in the Everglades and in Southern Florida in general, are there any interactions between them? Are there fights, or awkward mating attempts?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
