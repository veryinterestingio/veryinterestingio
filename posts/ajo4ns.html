		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Muons are particals that function like electrons, but where electrons ha e almost immeasurably small mass, muons have a bigger mass that is clearly measurable. It's still a stupid small number though and really hard to write.</p>
<p>Anyway, a muonic atom has muons where one or more of it's electrons should be, so it winds up heavier overall.</p>
<p>They're pretty rare though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's one interesting aspect I haven't seen mentioned. If you remember enough of your high school chemistry class, you probably remember learning the Pauli Exclusion Principle - when electrons take their places around the nucleus of an atom, they show up in pairs, and always with opposing spins. Each slot around the electron, called an orbital, fills with one pair of electrons, and no more can fit because no two can have the same quantum numbers. Muons can slide in as extra members of the same slot, though, because they have different numbers by default, so they don't really &quot;notice&quot; the electrons and just go wherever they want, but they have identical charges so are still attracted to the nucleus.</p>
<p>You might be thinking that this could have all kinds of cool implications for chemistry, and you would've been right, but muons live for a <em>very</em> short time - on average, their lifetime is only around 2 microseconds. That's actually a long time for a particle, but not enough to use for any chemical applications that I know of. There's a lower-energy configuration that can conserve the quantum numbers of a muon, and if a particle has that opportunity, it'll take it. The only reason electrons don't do this too is that no lower-energy options conserve their charge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Atoms consists of a positively charged nucleus and a negatively chaged electron . Muon is a subatomic particle which can be positive or negative . If we substitute the electron in a hydrogen atom with negative muon we get a muonic hydrogen atom</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Muons way a lot more and are larger than electrons. Also they decay very quickly into an electron and some neutral particles. So not much besides that. You can even have atoms that have muons replacing electrons and those will be stable until the muon decays.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
