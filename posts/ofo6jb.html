		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One way to estimate what we're &quot;running out of&quot; is the reserves-to-production ratio.  Reserves are all the mapped, quantified, and economically viable resources we know about; production is how much new material is mined each year.  The ratio of these tells you <em>how many years the resource will last, if nothing changes</em>.</p>
<p>Of course, things do change: the amount of production we need may increase (or decrease), we may discover new deposits, we find better way to extract resources, and as prices rise, less-profitable deposits become viable reserves.  The classic example is <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/682098/oil-reserves-to-production-ratio-worldwide/" target="_blank">petroleum</a>: in 1980, the reserves-to-production ratio was 30 years.  But we did not run out of oil in 2010... in fact, as of 2019 the reserves-to-production ratio is now 50 years, because of new discoveries, better offshore production technology, and fracking.</p>
<p>But still, reserves-to-production ratio tells you which resources we'll run out of soonest if we don't do anything about it.  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-020-0011-0" target="_blank">Jowitt et al (2020)</a> estimate R/P ratios for most commonly mined metals.  Taking only estimates made since 1987, the commonly-mined elements with the lowest R-P ratios are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indium: 12.3 years</li>
<li>Silver: 17.7 years</li>
<li>Gold: 19.0 years</li>
<li>Lead: 20.4 years</li>
<li>Zinc: 20.2 years</li>
<li>Tin: 24.9 years</li>
<li>Antimony 26.2 years</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, the most common examples people give of &quot;stuff we're about to run out of&quot; aren't on this list. R/P ratios for &quot;rare earth&quot; elements are over 1000 years, and platinum-group elements as a group have a 170-year supply.  The presence of gold and silver is probably no surprise, but I was surprised to find base metals like lead, zinc, and tin on this list.  But once again, that doesn't mean we'll be out of lead in 20 years: R/P ratios for these elements have remained stable at about 20 years since the 1950s.</p>
<p>Perhaps a better interpretation is that there's no strong economic incentive to search for inexpensive commodities so long as we have at least 20 years of supply available, and one possible conclusion from this data is that <strong>we're not really urgently running out of anything.</strong></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if it quite fits, but sand.  </p>
<p>We need sand for aggregate in concrete, but it has to be a special, jagged shape. Deserts have round sand because it's eroded by wind, doesnt work for concrete, you need sand eroded by water instead and that is much less plentiful, existing in lake and river beds and floodplains and ocean shores.  </p>
<p>We extract 50 BILLION TONS of it per year and mining it is terrible for the environment, leading to the destruction of corals, wetlands, and other marine environments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Phosphorous is required by all life. Peak phosphorous mining has occurred and we are on the downward slope. It can be recycled if waste is buried but as we all know most modern sewage systems flush into rivers and the ocean.  From there the only way to recover phosphorous is through guano mining and guano deposits were mostly depleted by the early 20th century.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Phosphate rock is getting more difficult to get, particularly in good quality. It is processed to  phosphate which is then added to fertilisers. Without phosphate the crop yields will drop dramatically. A lack of phosphate fertiliser would basically end the 'green revolution'. </p>
<p>There are no substitutes as phosphate is a key substance for many biological processes. The EU has already started programs to develop technology to recover phosphate from animal wastes, bones and urine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
