Also: what is its relationship to physics and dimensions if any?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Euclidean geometry is a specific type of geometry.</p>
<p>And in short, it's just geometry done on a flat surface as opposed to one that's curved.  Yeah, thats...thats literally it. Unless you went to college specifically for math all of the geometry you have ever done has been euclidean geometry.</p>
<p>Now, why is that such an important thing and why is it called that?</p>
<p>Back in like 300 BC a guy named Euclid wrote a book called <em>Elements</em> and it was basically the cornerstone of all geometry and math for a very long time.  And in it he wrote 5 postulates, basically just ideas he said where true.</p>
<p>And the 5th one (the others aren't super important) basically says that if you take two lines that are perfectly parallel they will be perfectly parallel forever, and any two lines which are not perfectly parallel must intersect somewhere.</p>
<p>This is true on a flat surface, but as soon as the surface you are working on is curved that's no longer true. Two lines that are parallel in one spot can end up intersecting somewhere else.</p>
<p>tl;dr when you draw lines on a piece of paper its Euclidean when you draw lines on a globe its non-euclidean</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the geometry of the universe you always thought you lived in: Parallel lines never converge, the interior angles of a triangle always sum to 180 degrees, the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, etc.</p>
<p>It's related to physics because our world seems very Euclidean, but when we go to the extremes of gravity, we find that our universe is not Euclidean: Space can bend and curve. Different observers measure different distances, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We define geometries by how we measure the distance between two points (called the <em>metric</em>). Euclidean geometries are ones where the distance is defined “as the crow flies”, that is, a straight line between the points. </p>
<p>In turn this gives a “flatness” to the geometry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is about Euclids five axioms of geometry. This was five things about geometry that he assumed were all true. And in the last 2300 years we have been able to prove that four of them are always true. However the fifth one is not always true. This is the parallel postulate. And without this fifth axiom a lot of the geometry you learned in school does not work. So we usually divide geometry into Euclidian geometry and non-euclidian geometry. One where we assume the fifth axiom and one where we don't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
