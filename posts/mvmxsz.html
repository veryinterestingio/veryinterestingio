		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Touching, as you probably consider it, does not exist. All interactions take place at a distance - like magnets. While electrons are, as particles, incredibly tiny (even compared to other things on an atomic scale), they still repel other electrons and <em>very forcefully so</em> if those other electrons get too close.</p>
<p>So, while an electron does not physically occupy the space in an atom, it still has claim to that space and will prevent other electrons from occupying said space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine atoms are balloons. Balloons are mostly empty space (air, but bear with me), but even so, balloons cannot pass through balloons.</p>
<p>In an atom, the electrons buzzing around super fast on the outside form the 'skin' of the balloon. Electrons repel the electrons from other atoms, just like the skin of balloons make them bounce off each other.</p>
<p>So your skin is a bunch of balloons glued together. Your blood is also a bunch of balloons, so it can't just slip through. Organs are lots and lots of balloons glued together, so they can't fall through either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://landgreen.github.io/physics/notes/electromagnetism/electrostatics/index.html" target="_blank">electromagnetic force</a> allows chemical bonds to form. These bonds give solid matter its rigid structure.</p>
<p>At the atomic scale, particles can't pass through each other primarily because of a quantum mechanical effect called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle" target="_blank">Pauli exclusion principle </a>. The Pauli exclusion principle is mostly responsible for keeping particles, like electrons, separate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems like you are thinking of protons and electrons in an atom as some sort hard, impenetrable bodies of a certain size -- like tiny billiard balls.  If you are under this impression, then you would think that contact forces between these billiard balls are the only real forces that exist -- and so any action-at-a-distance, like gravity or magnetism -- likely seems very mysterious to you.</p>
<p>Actually it's the other way around. Everything in the universe is action at a distance.  Contact forces are just an example of action over very tiny, tiny distances.</p>
<p>Atoms in a molecule or in a solid material are held together by electromagnetic forces -- the electrons in one atom are attracted to the protons in the other atom, however the two atoms can't get too close together or else the protons in the nucleus will start to repel each other.  There is a certain distance where these attractive and repulsive forces cancel out, and that is what make atoms &quot;bond&quot; to each other.</p>
<p>This bond distance is much larger than the &quot;size&quot; of the proton and electron (actually protons and electrons don't really have a &quot;size&quot; -- again they're not billiard balls, it's better to think of them as fuzzy clouds).  But still pretty tiny, in human terms.  Depending on a lot of factors, these bonds might be so rigid that the atoms can't move around at all (like in a solid), or they might allow for some viscosity (in a liquid), or they might be so weak as to be non-existent (as in a gas).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
