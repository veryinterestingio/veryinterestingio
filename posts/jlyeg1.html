		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Take a piece of paper, draw something, and photocopy it. Photocopy the photocopy, and keep using the result as your original. Use the world's best photocopier.</p>
<p>Now do that for 100 years. Look at the result.</p>
<p>Your body is the world's best photocopier. By the time you are 18-24 years old, the body is done developing. It is (partially) the mystery of life that our children (our reproductive cells) are not impacted by this degradation. We're just now starting to figure that bit out, and yes, we might be able to use that knowledge to extend life greatly.</p>
<p>And in case you haven't drawn the conclusion yet, the better you maintain the photocopier, the better it will work at making copies. <em>Makin' copies!</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am 71, and I have walked all my life. I now also work out with weights, age-appropriate weights, but I do. I can see that I’m pretty wrinkly looking, but I am well within BMI for my height and generally speaking have a fair amount of energy. I try and eat sensibly, which is not to say I don’t occasionally eat not sensibly but mostly.  But after all that, I do not have the energy levels I had when I was younger even though I’m reasonably proud of the energy levels I do have. I think you have to keep trying but be realistic and not beat yourself up because ageing is a real process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

You can definitely work to minimize the deterioration but it is inevitable that you will get weaker as a whole with age.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There could many, many, many reasons why fatigue sets in the more people age. They do overlap making it a question that can be unique to each individual. </p>
<p>Lifestyle- As we age life becomes more demanding and stressful. We get jobs, go to school, start families and form more complex social lives and adopting energy consuming roles in society. On average, children and teenagers have a lot less to worry about in terms of stress than someone who has the above mentioned established. That's why it is important to rest when stressed and get sleep in. Yes, diet, exercise and hydration influence fatigue, lol.</p>
<p>Biology- Genes can be triggered or damaged over a person's lifetime to affect so many aspects of their functioning. Things like hormones and genetic diseases can affect a person's fatigue as they grow older. Some hormones that influence sleep actually decrease as we age. This explains why sleep is vital for development and why the elderly tend to be more restless. </p>
<p>Mental/Psychological- Depression, stress, trauma boredom, and other forms of psychological states can affect a person's energy levels. Depression can not only leave a person with crushing fatigue but it may also reduce the quality of sleep.</p>
<p>There are so many things influencing our energy levels that it is always important to check in with professionals depending on your needs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
