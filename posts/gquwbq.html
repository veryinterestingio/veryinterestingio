		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University and the Director of the university's Center of Theoretical Physics. I am also the co-founder of the <a href="https://www.worldsciencefestival.com/" target="_blank">World Science Festival</a>, an organization that creates novel, multimedia experience to bring science to general audiences.</p>
<p>My scientific research focuses on the search for Einstein's dream of a unified theory, which for decades has inspired me to work on string theory. For much of that time I have helped develop the possibility that the universe may have more than three dimensions of space. </p>
<p>I'm also an author, having written four books for adults, <em>The Elegant Universe</em>, <em>The Fabric of the Cosmos</em>, <em>The Hidden Reality</em>, and just recently, <em>Until the End of Time</em>. <em><a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/series/the-elegant-universe/" target="_blank">The Elegant Universe</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/series/the-fabric-of-the-cosmos/" target="_blank">The Fabric of the Cosmos</a></em> were both adapted into NOVA PBS mini-series, which I hosted, and a short story I wrote, <em>Icarus at the End of Time</em>, was adapted into a live performance with an original score by Philip Glass. Last May, my work for the stage <em><a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/series/the-fabric-of-the-cosmos/" target="_blank">Light Falls</a></em>, which explores Einstein's discovery of the General Theory, was broadcast nationally on PBS.</p>
<p>These days, in addition to physics research, I'm working on a television adaptation of Until the End of Time as well as various science programs that the World Science Festival is producing.</p>
<p>I'm originally from New York and went to Stuyvesant High School, then studied physics at Harvard, graduating in 1984. After earning my doctorate at Magdalen College at the University of Oxford in 1987, I moved to Harvard as a postdoc, and then to Cornell as a junior faculty member. I have been professor mathematics and physics at Columbia University since 1996.</p>
<p>I'll be here at 11 a.m. ET (15 UT), AMA!</p>

I took the special relativity course on World Science U, and while it does not exactly fit on my resume for gas station attendant being able to say I took a course taught by a world renown professor is my top brag at partied. Thank you again for that.</p>
<p>Secondly, I guess I should have a question. If you could host a show with any historical figure, who would you choose and what would be the subject of the show?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I read your book <em>The Elegant Universe</em> when I was younger and very much enjoyed it. Unfortunately, I haven't reading as much on the topic of string theory since I left university.</p>
<p>So are there any new developments or big changes on the field of string theory in the last 15 or so years?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Do you believe we are getting closer to obtaining experimental evidence for string theory? What research and experiments have captured your interest lately in that area?</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF4ju6j6aLE" target="_blank">Back in 2013</a> you have a talk on String Theory including possible experiments that could provide experimental data on it.  Now that we have an additional 7 years of experimental results, from CERN, astronomy, and deep neutirno and WIMP experiments, has your outlook for the future been changed?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
