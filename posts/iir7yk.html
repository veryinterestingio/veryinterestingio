<p>Philosophically you can’t, its the color problem, I can’t know if my red is interpreted by my mind the same as your red.</p>
<p>Physically its actually pretty easy, you check responses and capability of differentiation. We can produce light in all different wavelengths, well outside of human perception. So we test them based on that. We see what animals react to/are attracted to (all you need to tell if mantis shrimp can see uv light is in fact a uv lamp). You give the smarter ones puzzles based on color (we do the same for humans with color blind tests really), and you give harsher stimulus to the dumber ones. If they react it means that stimulus hit a sensory organ and sent a message to their brain to respond to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can also examine the eyes and brains of other animals after they die, and sometimes even by fMRI while they're alive. We can tell how many different types of cones (which are relevant for colour vision) and how many rods (relevant for light/shadow perception, which give information about what colours they can see, how good their night vision might be, etc. We can look at how well their eye muscles are developed, the shape of their lens, and many other physical things to make guesses about how they might have used their eyes in life. With brain imaging, some animals can be sedated and scanned while different stimuli are presented, and then we can watch how the brain reacts to various types of light or movement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The laws that govern the way light is bent and focused by a lens are the same for all cameras and eyes. Sticking to the camera model, the laws are the same for all types of film, no color photography is possible with black and white film.  </p>
<p>The retina is the &quot;film&quot; in an eye and the way a retina responds to light is dependent on the visual pigments in the retina. We primates have excellent color vision, within our limits. By comparing the visual pigments in the eyes of cats, dogs, any other mammal to the pigments in our own we can get an accurate idea as to what colors they can see. By extending this we know that many insects can see in ultraviolet light and that flowers have markings in them that invite pollinators to where &quot;the good stuff&quot; is and that happens to be in the pathway to get dusted with pollen, even though we are literally blind to UV light.   </p>
<p>Back to the camera model; the amount of resolution a camera can achieve is limited by the &quot;grain size&quot; of the light reactive chemicals in the film, or the density of pixels in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge-coupled_device" target="_blank">Charge Coupled Device</a> in a digital camera. Finer grain size  in film gets finer resolution in a film camera, more pixels per unit area in the CCD gets better resolution digitally. In eyes the density of light sensitive cells in the retina limits the resolution of the eye. We know that an eagle has thousand of times more light sensitive cells it its retina than we do so we can confidently state that an eagle can spot a rabbit from an altitude of a thousand feet that we would scarcely be able to see at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A number of different methods are used.</p>
<p>As mentioned in another post, one can look at receptor cells, and brain activation patterns and such.  Basically neuroanatomy and neurophysiology.</p>
<p>The other thing that is done is behavioural.  You basically ask the animal to discriminate between two wavelengths of light.  (You show them two stimuli and they are rewarded for 'answering' 'same' or 'different'.  They don't, of course say anything, they do this with some sort of behavioural response).</p>
