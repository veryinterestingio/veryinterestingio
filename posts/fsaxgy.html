<p>I'm here to answer your questions about these latest findings and answer any other questions you may have about anosmia, ageusia, smell or taste.</p>
<p><em>Just a little bit of information on me:</em></p>
<p>I'm a professor of the Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Director of the Center for Smell and Taste, and Co-Director of UF Health Smells Disorders Program at the University of Florida.</p>
<p>I received a BA in Biology from the University of Virginia (1989) and Ph.D. in Neuroscience from the University of Florida (1997). I completed postdoctoral training in molecular biology at Johns Hopkins University before joining the faculty at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in 2000, where I remained until joining UF in 2014.</p>

<p>About what proportion of sudden anosmia would be attributable coronavirus at the moment?</p>
<p>And oppositely, about what proportion of fever and cough without anosmia would be coronavirus at the moment?</p>
<p>Thanks for doing this! It's nice to get a scientific source on coronavirus amongst my hair-drying my mouth and hot baths.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello everyone. Before we start, I thought I’d add some basic facts and definitions to make sure everyone has the basics. Also, I know some are mailing questions…I’ll get to those, too. Depending on volume, it may be after the live AMA has ended.</p>
<p>COVID-19 – the coronavirus disease we are all dealing with right now
SARS-CoV-2 – the name of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19</p>
<p>Anosmia – the absence or loss of smell (some people are born without the ability to smell, others acquire it due to disease, injury or toxin exposure)
Hyposmia – a reduced ability to smell
Parosmia – distorted smell (you sniff a rose and it smells like burning rubber)
Phantosmia – phantom smells (you smell smoke but there is no smoke)</p>
<p>There are equivalent disorders for taste that have similar names…for example, Ageusia is the loss or absence of taste).</p>
<p>Collectively, these smell and taste disorders are known as chemosensory disorders and they are quite prevalent (not just associated with COVID-19). For example, a recent NHANES-associated study (2016) found that nearly 15% of people 40 years old and older report a significant smell or taste impairment.</p>
<p>A common cause of smell loss (temporary or permanent) are upper respiratory infections (the common cold, influenza, etc). </p>
<p>Many who report a loss of taste likely actually have a smell impairment. This is because our brain combines smell and taste information in our perception of flavor. So, smell loss leads to impaired flavor perception.</p>
<p>Finally, I will stress that I am a scientist, not a physician. I cannot (and it would be unethical to) diagnose anyone on here. I will try to give you relevant information where I can, but if you have experienced a smell or taste loss (recent or long-term), please contact your physician. For specialist, it is generally an otolaryngologist with rhinology specialization (especially at one of the few smell clinics around the world) who will be most knowledgeable about these disorders.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What is the link between taste/smell and the immune system?  I've heard the taste and olfactory receptor genes tend to have very specific functions.  Would you be surprised if something starting with TAS or OR shows up as a significant candidate gene in a GWAS for the COVID-19 virus?  Do you think immune function is directly linked to some of these receptor genes, or are these symptoms maybe more related to the physical proximity of the taste/smell receptor cells?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to the <em>Adv Otorhinolaryngol</em> article, with other upper respiratory infections loss of smell occurs after the infection, not during. Why is this during the infection with COVID-19? Is it a different mechanism for loss of smell? Like inflammation instead of damage to nerves or receptors? What is the mechanism with other viruses?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
