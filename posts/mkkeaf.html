		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not that <em>literate</em> people are less likely to have kids.</p>
<p>It's that populations with a higher rate of literacy... also tend to have a higher level of development - better medical care, better education, more industries and jobs concentrated on advanced technologies.</p>
<p>If you look at how a country developed in time you can see why this is a trend.</p>
<p>A country starting out a few hundred years ago that was based on agriculture (farming and harvesting) had a lower quality of health care, which meant people were more likely to die. Also, having more children was an asset, a positive thing, because they could help contribute to the work on the farm. But you were also more likely to have even <em>more</em> kids than that because you kind of anticipated that at least a few or more would die from disease.</p>
<p>Then medicine started getting better, and technology started getting better. People started moving to the city and the mortality rate for children started to drop. But this was a transitional period so people were still poppin' kids out.</p>
<p>Then finally a <em>lot</em> of people settled in the city, and having kids became a <em>liability</em>, a burden, because... well, your 14 year old kid isn't going to be helping you compile and file financial reports for your job at Goldman-Sachs. And you could feel comfortable having just one or two kids because with modern medicine you have a really strong guarantee that they are gonna be healthy and survive through adulthood.</p>
<p>Now, there are still a lot of countries that are developing around the world and unfortunately do not have access to the same level of medicine that other countries have, and they still rely on very manual farming and fishing jobs for survival. So they're in that early stage still.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a <a href="https://wol.iza.org/uploads/articles/228/pdfs/female-education-and-its-impact-on-fertility.pdf" target="_blank">highly studied</a> issue, and there is a lot of literature on it.  As with many social science questions, there are <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/health/female-education-and-childbearing-closer-look-data" target="_blank">multiple factors</a> in play.   However, the main ones seem to be that as girls and women gain more social and economic opportunities through education, they tend to seek to have fewer children.  But there are also other factors, such as better information about reproductive health and birth control, and better negotiation strength with their husbands.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What everyone else said but to not overlook a very important point: When given options, women on average elect to have few to no children. Kids not dying and all that is true, sure but I don't think we should be shocked that women wouldn't voluntarily spend a lot of time with a debilitating life-threatening medical condition as if that's somehow surprising.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a kind of eb and flow to birth rate.</p>
<p>It used to be, back in older times, you would have as many kids as you could to increase the likelihood that as many as possible would make it to adulthood.</p>
<p>As medicines got better, we increased the rate at which our offspring made it to adulthood. However, the social norms took time to catch up. You were still expected to have many children.</p>
<p>Globally this explains why birth rates in richer countries are lower than in developing countries. The developing world is still behind on that benefit of medicine, so they also need their social norms to change. The penetration of increasing medicines is indirectly linked to the increase in literacy rates. </p>
<p>On a more local level, the difference between the rich and poor having children is basically tied to how much they see a child impacting their livelihood. The extremely poor actually get more benefits from social programs if they have more children, so it's not really much of a factor for them. They can actually end up with more in their pockets at the end of the day with a child. In the meanwhile, the people with <em>some</em> money who don't qualify for those programs have to worry about the cost of children themselves.</p>
<p>This is especially evident in the US, where the poorest people qualify for socialized healthcare. They are not out of pocket for the birth of their child. However, go up one class level, and suddenly people need to save up $10,000 or more for the birth of their child. This will restrict how many children they can have.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>James Nicoll may have explained it best:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Until recently baby production was largely dependent on slave labour; as soon as women are allowed to answer the question &quot;Would you like to squeeze as many objects the size of a watermelon out of your body as it takes to kill you?&quot; they generally answer &quot;No, thank you.&quot; This leads to falling birthrates everywhere women are not kept enslaved and ignorant of the alternatives.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>--Dave, literacy for everyone USUALLY leads to literacy and lack of ignorance for many women</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
