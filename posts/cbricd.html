		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s true that that’s what the woman’s doctors told her at the time. We’ve learned more since that indicates it isn’t likely. Her first person account is included in the book Voices from Chernobyl. It’s a short and very interesting read, and was a primary source for the show.</p>
<p>The show writer has an accompanying podcast in which he directly answers a lot of the questions that are frequently asked about the show, including things about the science, history, and culture, along with why they made the artistic decisions they did. I highly recommend it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. In a chernobyl-like disaster the two main concerns are <em>exposure to radiation</em> and <em>contamination by radioactive material</em>. Neither one would realistically lead to a fetus protecting the mother from radiation exposure. </p>
<p>With respect to direct radiation exposure, radiation comes in three varieties: alpha, beta, and gamma radiation. The first (alpha) would be absorbed by the mother's skin. The third (gamma) would go straight through the mother and the baby, and would not be significantly absorbed by either (but can still cause damage to both).</p>
<p>Beta radiation would be absorbed by the body, and can penetrate a few centimeters. Here it's possible that a fetus and amniotic sac could absorb some radiation that would otherwise travel to the mother's lower abdomen. However, for this to make a significant difference the mother would have to be primarily exposed in the lower abdomen (and nowhere else) from the front. Both of these are implausible in a Chernobyl-style scenario. </p>
<p>Contamination by radioactive material is a concern because that material then stays on or in the body and emits radiation which could then cause harm. When this material enters the body some of it will be excreted in the blood, sweat, and urine. Other materials can be absorbed into certain organs for longer periods of time (particularly the thyroid and bones). Thus, the baby can be exposed to radiation from contamination of the mother's body, such as contamination concentrated in the urinary bladder. In particular, contaminants in the mother's blood will be shared with the fetus via the umbilical cord and are not filtered by the placenta. However, the fetus doesn't accumulate or absorb more contamination than the rest of the mother's body. Even if it did, that could actually be worse for the mother if those contaminants would have been otherwise excreted.</p>
<p>Radiation is certainly a concern for fetal health, especially in the first trimester. <a href="https://emergency.cdc.gov/radiation/pdf/prenatal.pdf" target="_blank">It's possible that a direct radioactive exposure could cause stillbirth, but these exposures are more associated with mental and cognitive effects.</a> Exposures high enough to cause serious fetal harm past the first trimester would need to be high enough to cause the mother serious harm. However, other disaster effects like extreme stress, malnutrition, and lack of access to healthcare are just as likely if not more likely to cause problems for pregnant women and their babies than are the radiation effects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have stated, the TV series was based on a book <em>Voices of Chernobyl</em> which included the firsthand account of the woman re: her pregnancy and stillbirth. She had been told by doctors that her miscarriage/stillbirth was related to radiation exposure from her husband that was absorbed by the fetus. But that was later revealed to be inaccurate. Because it was a powerful humanizing moment in the book, though, it made it into the show.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. That was IMO the most annoying factual error in the series. The firemen being treated in the hospital were not dangerous to be around. That's not how radiation works. They were isolated because they were burn victims and at great risk of getting an infection via their wounds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
