		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other people have given good answers about how the Mongols manages to control so much land, so I'll talk a bit more about borders. &quot;Borders&quot; are a very modern concept. Back in the olden days, your borders were really just how far you could project your political influence before you came into conflict with someone else's political influence projection. The places where these projected influences overlap were called &quot;marches&quot;, land that no one had an exclusive claim over because no one could establish an exclusive political or military presence there, typically because it was too close to neighbours who were also looking to control it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The key thought is the concept of projection of power.  It's not his many trips you have in titan, it's how many can you mobilize in a short period you attach the enemy.</p>
<p>The Mongols were masters at this.  They could bring an army of 20,000, and hit a singular point with pretty much all of them. By contrast, their opposition was mainly static.</p>
<p>It's hard to rebel against an empire that could show up at your doors with weeks with the of thousands of troops, during which you've barely started to assemble your own men.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, through a combination of military superiority and relatively progressive social constructs, they were able to take and keep whatever regions they wanted. </p>
<p>Military superiority - They were incredibly skilled and well equipped warriors both from horseback and on foot. Most famously they demonstrated far superior longbow distance and accuracy from horseback. Beyond that, each warrior was trained in several weapon disciplines and typically carried more than one weapon at a time, so they could adapt well and quickly to any battleground or situation. They had more horses than soldiers, so they could swap between them and cover incredible distances very quickly. To hide their true numbers from scouts, they would even prop dummies on some of their spare horses.</p>
<p>Progressive social policies - They largely let the people continue to live their lives as long as they paid their taxes and did not oppose them, avoiding the typical forms of raising contempt from conquered peoples. Most notably, they were pretty much the only conquerors offering religious freedom. They wouldn’t typically rule directly but rather let a local remain as a figurehead while appointing a Mongolian to stick around to guide their hand / keep watch. They established trade routes that connected lands to never before seen goods and implemented education systems. They established skill based social systems - royalty and heredity being far less valuable to them than skill, especially since they would just take the wealth of those nobles for themselves.</p>
<p>In a time of blatantly class based society there really was not much reason for the ‘common folk’ to rebel. And even if they wanted to, the Mongols had no problems dealing swift and deadly vengeance, fully eradicating the opposition through their military might.</p>
<p>Truly fascinating topic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
