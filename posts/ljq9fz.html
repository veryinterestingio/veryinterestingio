		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two reasons:</p>
<p>First: obviously the money. Pay $30 today, or $4/month for years and years... for as long as you use the app. Monthly keeps a steady income for the developers so they can pay their bills. It’s also way easier for someone to pull the trigger and buy an app for $2.99, than $1,099.</p>
<p>Second: support. With a subscription, there’s only one version of the software. So support is MUCH easier, and everyone is forced to use the latest version.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They make more money that way.  And the app developers are continuing to support the app, so want continued income.</p>
<p>If you bought the app for let's say $10 that is a one time thing and you could just the app for years without paying more.</p>
<p>If you are on a subscription for $1 a month then they would take in a lot more over the years of you using the app.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the case of something like photoshop,  $300 presented a financial barrier to some users. Making it $15/month with a free trial week encourages a whole lot of casual users to sign up, many of whom will forget to cancel at the end of the trial and pay at least one month. 20 such users represents one full priced version that likely wouldn't have sold previously. The next group of users, who might mess with it once every couple of months, are also unlikely to pay full price but will continue leasing the software out of convenience and the low monthly cost. You likely wouldn't pay $300 for something you <em>might</em> use 20 times, but paying a mere $15 to edit some family photos once a month for 20 months seems like a no-brainer. The last group of customers is the avid user. The math on this one is reversed. A frequent user used to be able to spend $300 and use the software for several years, transferring the license from one computer to the next. Now, that user must pay for the software every month. If the company waits 24 months between releases, this user has paid $360 for the software and will be forced to upgrade to the new version when its released, and continue paying the same fee forever. On top of that, the company gets to charge instructors for classes on the new features, and those instructors get to charge users for classes as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you won’t pay for the app. If you do you won’t pay more than $5 and expect new features and updates for life. That’s unsustainable. </p>
