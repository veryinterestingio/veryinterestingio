		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think some of the answers here are missing some information.</p>
<p>Edit: Added TL;DR ELI5-like version at the bottom.
But a 5-year old that knows what tolerance and substance means should kinda understand some parts of these.</p>
<p>See the body is a complex chemical machine that does crazy stuff to stay balanced chemically all the time, so everything you eat it will react accordingly to keep levels of substances in the blood which that can maintain life.</p>
<p>You see you can usually classify substances you consume in let's say 3 categories.</p>
<p>1) Substances that can bind to existing receptors. Such substances are similar to existing hormones or neurotransmiters, say opiods, they bind to existing receptors. To these types of substances the body usually does two things 1) It lowers the production of the existing substance/substances in the body that is similar to the one you consume 2) It increases the resistance of the receptors.</p>
<p>Usually after such a substance binds to a receptor it is &quot;consumed&quot;/changed so it is either metabolized into stuff that is thrown away from the body or into parts that can be reused later. IF this wasn't the case then obviously you'd have an effect that lasts forever.</p>
<p>So for example if you took opiods your body will stop producing the same dose of existing feel good substances and also create resistance in the receptors, that's why you'd feel so awful after you stopped taking them. If you took steroids (in bodybuilding jargon, testosterone derivatives that is) for example your body will stop producing testosterone in itself, and after a while your testicles would shrink since they are no longer used as much.And if you stopped taking them you'd feel bad and it will take a long time to recover.</p>
<p>2)Types of substances that the body can digest/break up into other types of substances/destroy.</p>
<p>This ranges from most types of food, coffee, alcohol, types of poison/venom etc.</p>
<p>Edit: as msief has pointed out caffeine actually  binds to receptors. So drinking coffee  regularly will both increase tolerance of the receptors to the caffeine and also increase enzymes production that can break down coffee and remove it more efficiently from the blood.</p>
<p>This means that the body can simply produce more of an enzyme, or more antibodies to destroy/break down the substance.</p>
<p>This varies from person to person, some people for example are too sensitive to caffeine and might almost die from a couple cups of coffee while other can handle more.</p>
<p>But the basic idea is the body can just work harder to break the substance into parts that it can handle better. Of course this works up to a certain degree, since ingesting some substances means no matter how efficient your body gets at disposing of it, it will still have a big effect on it.</p>
<p>For example if you eat too much refined sugar, it's a great stress to the body since no matter how much insulin it produces there is up to a certain amount it can process in the blood.</p>
<p>In the case of things that are venomous or poisonous or just things our bodies can produce antibodies for, after an initial (non-lethal dose) your body will keep antibodies around for some time, anticipating further consumption/infection hence you maintain resistance for a while.</p>
<p>This resistance can range form hours to years, this is how vaccines work to a degree.</p>
<p>This is also how you can gain resistance to poisons or snake venom for example, our bodies already have the antibodies to neutralize them, or they can produce antibodies to neutralize a specific type of venom/poison but since it would be too energy consuming to keep all the antibodies types all the time, the body doesn't produce them until an infection. Unfortunately many types of venom will kill you faster than the body can produce the antibodies to fight it, but if you put a non-lethal dose the body will keep antibodies around for a while, anticipating further infection/foreign bodies, and if you increase the dose the body will produce even more and you can eventually survive a dose that would be lethal to the average person.</p>
<p>3) The last category are usually substance that aren't as organic and complex, like certain types of metal. So they have an effect on the body and the body can't really slow down their effect, just flush them out. Some of them can be flushed easily in urine, but others can bind to proteins or cells and remain there for years, so the body doesn't really know how to react to this.</p>
<p>Usually such substances are ones you aren't really supposed to consume or even have in your natural environment, like some pollution particles are the hardest to take out of the body and impossible to build a tolerance since your body has no way of resisting the effects of the substance, and maybe even no way of taking it out of the body or preventing it to get in.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>Edit: Added a section related to antibodies and venom/poison, usually these are the substances that you can gain resistance to otherwise lethal doses.</p>
<p>Edit2: <strong>TL;DR ELI5 version</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the type of substance the body can either:</p>
<p>1) Just  pee it out or break it down into substances it knows how to pee out. This usually applies for food-like substances; Resistance is build by making more enzymes to break stuff easier but usually you can't gain much resistance to such stuff, not to the same degree you could for say poisons (see below)</p>
<p>2) It can produce antibodies to neutralize the substance. This applies to poisons, venom, some other toxic substances and infectious viruses/bacteria. Usually a big dose at once will just kill you, but a big non lethal dose the body will keep antibodies for a while just to be sure, so if you increase the dose steady you can have enough antibodies to eventually neutralize a dose that would otherwise kill you.</p>
<p>3) It can produce less of substances your body usually produces and/or it will react less to it (block receptors).
This applies to substances you take that can be produced in the body or are similar to ones the body produces or the body reacts to them that way (such as opioids, hormones, etc)</p>
<p>4) Certain types of substances like some metals that can bind to your cells the body has no way of filtering them or react to them, so you can't gain a resistance at all to such substances. These are usually substances that you'd not naturally encounter or consume, usually inorganic components, like some raw metals or some pollution particles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well first thing first - <strong>It's a physical thing.</strong></p>
<p>There's this idea in biology called &quot;homeostasis&quot;. Basically, your body has an idea of chemical balance, and it adjusts to stay balanced. Like: it's hot out, so you sweat, so you cool down, then you stop sweating. Or you eat candy, which raises your blood sugar. Your body will release insulin, which will lower your blood sugar. As it gets back to normal, insulin release tapers off.</p>
<p>This applies to everything. If you drink alcohol once, it'll make you drunk. If you drink it every day, your body will start adjusting to compensate for it, and you'll have a harder and harder time getting drunk. Soon alcohol just brings you up to normal. If you then stop drinking, your body will now be off-balance in the other direction, and you'll go into withdrawal until homeostasis can be restored.
Pain? Similar deal. Your brain tries to maintain homeostasis. Acute, agonized misery is only sustainable for so long. If the pain itself can't be dulled down, your emotional reaction to it can be. The emergency shutoff switch is when this doesn't work, and all your emotions are cranked down as far as they can go. That includes distress, pleasure, and fear: basically, it causes apathetic depression. This is why you can't just expect people to &quot;get used&quot; to severe pain.</p>
<p>When I say this applies to everything, I mean it. Sex, gambling, sugar, background noise, everything is filtered through your perceptions in this way. Why aren't rich people all happy? Because that level of prosperity is their new normal. What's up with Stockholm syndrome? Victims become desensitized to abuse, and their expectations for &quot;kindness&quot; are steadily reduced. Why aren't teenagers overwhelmed by the pace of the internet? Because it's normal for them. Why don't better football helmets reduce the number of concussions? Because people just do dumber things in order to maintain the same sense of acceptable risk.</p>
<p>This one principle explains quite a bit about why people act the way they do.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body can build a tolerance to a substance in at least two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Getting rid of it quicker: Imagine the substance is removed from your body by being broken down in the liver by a particular enzyme.  Your body says to itself &quot;I keep having to break down this stuff, I'm going to make more of the enzyme&quot;.  The liver makes more enzyme, gets rid of the substance quicker, and you appear to become tolerant to the substance - although the substance is still affecting you, it's not hanging around as long.</p>
</li>
<li>Reacting to it less: Particularly with substances that affect the brain, constant exposure can reduce effectiveness.  Imagine a substance that affects particular brain cells which go on to make another substance that affects different brain cells.  If you keep on being exposed to it, your brain says &quot;I keep getting this signal, I'm going to react to it less.&quot;  It might make fewer of the molecules on the brain cells that react to the substance.  Or the brain cells might make less of the second substance.  Or the other brain cells might react less to that second substance.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other ways this can happen, but they're less common.</p>
<p>If you've got a substance that isn't removed from your body by being broken down - it just goes straight into your urine through the kidneys, for example - then the first route doesn't work.  </p>
<p>If your body can't stop reacting less to the molecule - maybe it works on a part of the cell that's essential or that the body can't make less of - then the second route doesn't work.</p>
<p>YMMV, this is just ELI5, IANAL, etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had two epidural's in at once when I was in labour. The pain was really bad, even with two. I could still pull my legs up to give you an idea.  Finally had an emergency C section after 36 hours with a spinal. My second was a spinal as well.</p>
<p>I also had local anaesthesia for 3 moles that needed to be cut out on my back. When the Dr started to cut I said OUCH, I feel that!! He proceed to give me more. Again it hurt when he cut. So he ask the nurse to bring an unopened box ( thinking that perhaps the anaesthesia might be outdated or something).  Well the new box made no difference so he continue to cut me anyway. Not believing that I could still feel him cut... So I was laying down on my stomach and just trying to hold it together. I felt really traumatised afterwards and shaking. The cuts were about 3 inches long, total over kill ?</p>
<p>Got my first filling in 20 years 3 months ago. So warned my dentist the local anaesthesia might not fully work due to past experiences . AND...  it did not. She give me more and luckily second round I could not feel a thing. Whoop.</p>
<p>I've never used drugs. Guess I'm just unlucky. (: </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
