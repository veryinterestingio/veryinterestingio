		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The pain doesn’t come from the drugs being injected, it’s the after effects, that are the bad part.</p>
<p>Usually you don’t start feeling really bad till the next day or two days later (from personal experiences, not a doctor).</p>
<p>The other problem is that anesthesia, while it’s common and well known, isn’t a perfect science and it still always carries a risk, any medication does, and why risk the possibility that the chemo drugs and anesthetic and the patient might have some bad reaction, when you can instead just not give them extra drugs.</p>
<p>Small edit: the personal experience is from watching/helping my mother go through her treatment, and for those wondering I’m happy to say that now she’s doing great!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anaesthetics are actually a very dangerous type of medication. Not so much on a healthy person, but on people who are already suffering from illnesses like cancer, or treatments like chemo, it becomes much riskier.</p>
<p>It can be done if it's necessary. The risk isn't so high that it would never be done. But it's just not worth the risk when you could instead administer pain medication.</p>
<p>And that's forgetting the fact that chemo side effects are protracted. You couldn't reasonably keep someone under to avoid all of the side effects of chemo. You'd have to keep them under for days at a time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think lots of people have given a good eli5 for this, but I wanna come in with some more (eli5) depth about why and how chemotherapy causes pain to cancer patients</p>
<p>So I think we’ll all agree, cancer is a disease wherein some groups of cells divide more than they’re supposed to. In an ideal body (in adulthood), one should get no net gain in cells, right? If you produce more cells than you lose you’ll grow, if you produce less cells than you lose, you’ll break down. </p>
<p>So back to cancer, these cells are rapidly dividing, therefore most chemotherapeutics basically kneecap cells ability to divide. For a lot of cells in your body, this is fine- your heart cells and brain cells don’t need to divide a lot. But for tissues that see a lot of wear and tear and therefore need to divide - your gums, your airways, your skin, tear ducts, hair follicles- these are also kneecapped and can’t work as well </p>
<p>This causes your hair to fall out, gums to bleed, skin to be delicate, etc etc. All this is the price for kneecapping the cancer too. The futures looking better though, with time we’ll be able to develop and refine more ‘silver bullet’ approaches to treating cancers, and therefore less side effects on rapidly dividing non-cancer tissues</p>
