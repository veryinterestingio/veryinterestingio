		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For strength training, there is a very specific reason to breath out the mouth: valsalva and partial valsalva maneuvers.</p>
<p>The valsalva is when you exhale out your mouth... But your mouth (or throat) is closed tight.</p>
<p>What happens when you try to breathe out but the air is trapped? Pressure builds up in your abdomen and your abdomen tenses trying to push the air that's not moving.</p>
<p>This tension makes your abdomen more rigid, which helps support your core and you back and your spine.</p>
<p>This tension can be harnessed for other things too. With full body tension, individual muscles like arms and legs can sometimes exert more force. For example, while swinging a tennis racket, you can partial valsalva by closing your throat part way. The air will escape so you can keep breathing but as it is escaping a narrow passage, it will give a moment of abdomen tension before the air escapes.</p>
<p>This is why many tennis players grunt when they hit the ball or partly why some sports (like kendo or martial arts) teach people to cry out when they strike. It's also why grunting can sometimes help you lift heavy weights or push a stalled car.</p>
<p>We can better control how opened or closed the throat is compared to the nose, giving a lot more control over how much abdomenal pressure we build up.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My one claim to Reddit karma fame was asking this 3 years ago! Here's the best answer from u/Force3vo</p>
<p>The nose is actually a pretty awesome organ that helps make sure that the air you breathe is prepared as good as possible for your lungs.</p>
<p>That includes amongst other things filtering particles out of the air (This pesky nose-hair is actually good for things!), making sure the air  gets warmed up when it is cold and moisturizing the air if it is dry. Clean, moist and warm air is making sure that it's easy on the lungs and your breathing is efficient. Additionally breathing through your nose makes sure your air intake is regulated and you aren't prone to hyperventilating.</p>
<p>So that explains why breathing in through your nose while doing sports, meditation and... basically in every situation is the best way to breathe in, but why is breathing out through your mouth then advised in sports?</p>
<p>It's mostly about the speed of your oxygen intake. Or, to be more precise, about increasing the breathing frequency. As I just wrote the flow through your nose is rather limited. That works in both directions, if you breathe in as hard as you can and breathe out as hard as you can first through your nose then through your mouth you will see that you can breathe a lot faster through your mouth. So if you breathe out of your mouth you will save a little time which means that your intake frequency of oxygen will, overall, be higher.</p>
<p>TL:DR: Breathing in through your nose is easier on your lungs and more efficient, breathing out through your mouth has little drawbacks and is faster. Together it's the most efficient you can breathe if you need higher levels of oxygen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of good points have been made, particularly about how breathing through the nose humidifies the air and has other positive effects. So breathing through the nose is almost always optimal, except when doing rigorous exercise, since we just wouldn't be able to get enough oxygen.</p>
<p>It would be best if we could exclusively ventilate through the nose, but our max minute ventilation through the nose is severely limited around 20-30 L/min. It might sound like a lot, but we have to remember that the air we breath is roughly 21% oxygen and on top of that the lungs can't use all of it  leading us to exhale in the range of 13-15-16%, which means we only get 5-8% of pure O2 from the air we breathe. </p>
<p>A fit person to high level athlete can use 4-6 L of pure O2 per min, which would require about 100 L of air passing your lungs per minute! This is aerobic exercise that a person can maintain for quite a while. When it comes to anaerobic exercise the blood will slowly acidify, and to compensate the body will try to get rid of acids through exhaling tons of CO2. This is when you reach ventilation volumes upwards of 200 L which is magnitudes different from what exclusive nose breathing can supply.</p>
<p>So breathing through your nose is great, but sometimes not feasible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s actually a shit ton of reasons it’s better to breath through your nose. Like some people have said, the nose acts as a filter. It purifies, heats, moistens and pressurizes the air. Which increases oxygen absorption by 10-15%. It reduces blood pressure. Increases circulation which increases energy. Many other benefits as well. </p>
<p>Breathing through your mouth causes cavities. Increases blood pressure. Causes snoring/sleep apnea. Can misalign your jaw and reshape your mouth. Causing it to be more narrow which can close up the nasal passage. </p>
<p>I 100% recommend everyone read the book Breath by James Nestor. Mind blowing shit in there. Crazy how important nose breathing is.</p>
<p>After reading it I (38M) actually decide to get surgery to fix my deviated septum. It was deviated from birth and I always thought it was normal to breath through my mouth. I never understood how people could breath through their nose because it was so difficult for me. It sucks though. The dry mouth alone. </p>
<p>Couldn’t be happier. I’m sleeping so much better. I notice it the most when I exercise. My heart rate stays lower and my endurance is better. </p>
<p>Def breath through your nose as much as you can. Especially when you sleep. It will increase your life.</p>
<p>Edit: Thank you for all the comments and upvotes! I appreciate both sides of the argument and respect everyone's opinion. I'm no scientist or doctor. I read a book (that has sources), liked what I read, and chose to believe it. I'm simply sharing that info. Please do your own research and don't take a random's word from reddit as fact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
