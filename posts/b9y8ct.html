That way they could test the suits, with people inside them, in a hard vacuum before they actually sent anyone to space. If something went wrong during one of the tests the could open the door to the chamber and instantly repressurize it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The actual pressure change is not really that significant. It’s just one atmosphere. In the negative direction but one atmosphere. </p>
<p>A recreational diver experiences five times that, if he goes 50 meters underwater.  A submarine can withstand 40 times that. </p>
<p>Although these go in opposite directions, the engineering principles are essentially the same. The real challenge was in how to accomplish it without having everything inflate so much that it would excessively hinder the astronaut’s movements. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The suit’s performance is about the pressure differential across the suit. So, in a vacuum when the inside of the suit is pressurized at 1 atm the situation is not at all different from the situation where the outside pressure is 1 atm and the inside is pressurized at 2 atm. Sure, in a microscopic level the two scenarios are not identical but at the macroscopic level it makes no difference. Therefore, you can test the suit for vacuum in normal atmospheric conditions by pressurizing the inside of the suit. You could even have a person inside since 1 atm overpressure corresponds to about 10 m water column, which, as divers have shown, is easily tolerated by humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding on the what has already been said here.</p>
<p>The suits were also based off of a design already battle tested by SR71 and U2 pilots.</p>
<p>You might be interested in a documentary by James May called Edge of Space (90% sure) or Man on the Moon, where he goes into detail about this. It's a 2 part documentary and the second part he takes s flight on a U2... It's some of the coolest footage I've ever seen.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Experiments with pressure suits had happened since before WW2, buts it is also worth looking at the works of two Air Force doctors, John Stapp and Joseph Kittenger. The helped pioneer a lot of early space designs and technology. Plus they tested them out on themselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
