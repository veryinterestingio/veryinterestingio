		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Holland we don’t have tsunami’s, but the results of salt water floods have been studied pretty well. For instance, after the 1953 north sea flood.</p>
<p>For the Dutch soil, all salt from flooding is washed away within 1-4 years. This depends on sveral factors, such as duration of flood, dept of the groundwater level, amount of moisture in de ground above groundwater level, precipitation etc</p>
<p>For some recovery nature needs some help. The (NaCl) salt water also worsens the mineral structure of older clay. Even if the salt itself is already washed away. Naturally the clay could take up to 8 years to recover. Fertilizing with gypsum is enough to repair this and this pays for itself in the first year.</p>
<p>A sweet water flood costs 1 year of production, a salt water flood generally 2-3 years.With gypsum that 3 years can be reduced to 2 years of loss.  The second year some salt-resistant crops can be grown, so the economic damage could be a bit less. In fact, for weaker fields the silt from the inundation increases fertility in the long term.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems likely that tsunamis impact local plants / soil through the addition of clay and silt with a high salt content. Land is inundated by a tsunami for a relatively short period of time and the salt is usually washed away by precipitation anyway meaning that the saturation of soil by saltwater is not the leading cause of salt contamination. </p>
<p>While it is true that salt impacts plants through salt (<em>Na</em>) toxicity, water stress and a reduced nutrient uptake (especially of <em>K</em>), the main problem when it comes to tsunamis is the introduction of clay and silt from the seabed which has a high salt content. Salt in the soil is best washed away by fresh water, but because this clay / silt layer is relatively impermeable, the filtration process, called <em>leaching</em>, is slow. The duration of salt contamination will depend on the level of drainage and precipitation rates for that particular area so difficult to generalise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a consequence of rising sea levels and hurricane storm surge along Florida’s west coast causing the line where the salt water meets fresh water to move farther inland, you can see what happens; ghost forests where all the trees died rapidly from suddenly switching to saltwater. Plants that were farther out from that area will creep in. Growth of plants that were inland from that line will retreat farther.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know that Long Island (in the Bahamas) is suffering from the last hurricane. There is a lot of subsistence farming there and they have taken a huge hit since the entire island had flooding. No one seems to have any hard numbers on recovery and the Bahamian governemnt (either through apathy, corruption or lack of funds) doesn't seem to be in a hurry to figure out the problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
