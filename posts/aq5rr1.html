		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Magnets do get weaker over time, very slowly.  It's a chemical process rather than anything fundamental to magnetics- magnets lose strength at a similar (like, rough within two orders of magnitude) rate as their structure changes.</p>
<p>Neodymium magnets are one of the most stable magnets, for the same reason they're one of the strongest.  The neodymium in these magnets is formed into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neodymium_magnet#/media/File:Neodymium_Crystal_Structure_Nd2Fe14B.jpg" target="_blank">very long needles (blue) embedded in a supporting honeycomb</a>.  This ensures that the magnets are lined up with atomic precision and very rigidly.  They're very resistant to change and lose &lt;1% strength per decade, which AFAIK is mostly due to oxidization.  Oxygen content is the #1 factor in quality in these magnets.  </p>
<p>The rate of strength loss tends to drop off after a long time, but it depends heavily on the type and quality of magnet.  For instance, steel magnets will tend to drop off very quickly at first and then more slowly.  In steel magnets, magnetization causes crystal grains to extend and shrink in certain directions, which causes very large internal stresses.  Machinists will know that cold-rolled steel (which has similar large internal stresses) should never be used for precision work, as any cuts will release some of this strain and cause distortions that take hours or days to take full effect.  The same thing happens with steel magnets- these stresses will release over time, which will negatively impact the magnetic field.  After the largest strains equalize there will still be lots of tiny stresses that will take decades or centuries to decrease (me irl).  Over longer timescales, the steel will oxidize, which will eventually fully destroy the magnetism.  Wet, salty steel will crumble in a hundred years, while normal water will take millennia, and dry steel will last for tens or hundreds of thousands of years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some good answers here but I’m wondering if what OP meant was more in line with:</p>
<p>If a magnet was left alone would it’s magnetic field ever run out? </p>
<p>To set the stage, we have an empty universe, pure vacuum and a neodymium magnet with all other physical laws remaining the same. Will the field ever “wear out”, so to speak?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this question, i think me and probably other people get confused on this point. If magnets can pull materials they do work. And if they don't slowly lose magnetic strength, they can do work over and over infinitely without losing energy(or its power as it is asked in the title) which seems impossible. What is the mistake in this thought process ?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I have a very strong magnet that would allow me to lift a 100kg block of steel, and I a fix the magnet under a bridge holding the block of steel (with no cars or anything else going over), will the block of steel remain attached to the magnet until the bridge collapses?  If so, how does it seem to hold the steel for such a long time?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the answers so far are a bit misleading. A chemically stable magnet, on it's own, doesn't lose power over time. A magnet doesn't really lose energy to things which interact with it's magnetic field; that is to say, it doesn't do work. Sure, it creates a force preventing you from pushing two magnets into each other, but you're the one putting energy into the system then, not the magnet.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>A (single domain, natural (i.e. not current induced)) magnet's field comes from either the spin of electrons within the magnet, or the orbit the electrons have around the nucleus; it's fundamental, not something was 'charged up' with energy at some point in the past. It's just that in certain chemical/crystal structures, the lowest energy state is such that electron like to have their spin point in the direction, which over a large number of atoms creates a strong magnetic field.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This magnetic field behaves kind of like gravity. It takes energy to lift things up, but doing that many times doesn't make the Earth's pull any weaker.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Some magnets do lose their strength over time; this is typically due to chemical interactions (i.e. water/oxygen slowly breaking down the magnet, making it lose it's preference to keep electrons oriented the same way), or due it it forming 'domains', which consists of different portions of the magnet being pointed such that the magnetic field can 'loop around' within the magnet, reducing the field seen by the outside world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
