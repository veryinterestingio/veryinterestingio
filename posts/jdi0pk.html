		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Itâ€™s not just escaped birds learning/teaching wild birds to talk. </p>
<p>The crows that hang around our race course started mimicking the trainers and announcers. They got so good at it they would have jockeys and horses confused by calling out opposite commands; eg. the trainer would tell the jockey to pace and then stride out, the crows would call out pace! Pace! Pace! </p>
<p>They also loved the microphones and would call out through them when ever they got the chance. It was quite a highlight for many years. </p>
<p>They ended up putting air guns out there to chase the crows away every morning before training.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If anyone wants a fascinating documentary on escaped parrots populating American cities: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0424565/" target="_blank">The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill.</a></p>
<p>Parrots have been escaping their homes and then procreating in San Francisco. They are thriving despite not being native to this part of the world. Apparently, they're able to find their food sources from gardens growing imported plants and trees.</p>
<p>Many people don't know parrots can survive colder climates, but not without a food source, because their food normally grows in warm climates.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was watching &quot;life after humans&quot;, a neat show that chronicles what would likely happen if everyone on earth just vanished. They made a point to mention that even without humans, our words will persist for some years because of exactly this. They will teach their children and those around them! Although it isn't a very helpful adaptation so with each generation of birds there will be fewer and fewer words learned, from a very small pool of words to start with. Cool stuff!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
