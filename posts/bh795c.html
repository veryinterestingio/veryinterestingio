		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Reddit! As a <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/results/directory/profile/10001504/cynthia-james" target="_blank">researcher and genetic counselor</a> at Johns Hopkins Medicine, I'm <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/inhealth/precision-medicine-centers/arvc/" target="_blank">part of a team</a> that recently helped create a computer program that predicts who is at risk of sudden death in people with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). This tool will help us figure out who would benefit most from an implanted device that shocks the heart to get it back into rhythm. And, it could prevent 20 percent of patients with the disease from receiving unnecessary - and potentially risky - surgery to place a device that is not needed.</p>
<p>Often, people don't find out that they have ARVC until they experience a near fatal or fatal cardiac event. You may even have a family member who suddenly died because of this, which means someone else in your family - maybe even you - could have it. I'll see everyone at noon Eastern (16 UT), ask me anything!</p></div></div>
