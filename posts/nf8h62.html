<p>Plants reproduce sexually like humans and animals, that is what seeds and pollen and stuff do and when they do that they they have different DNA.  </p>
<p>plants also have a thing that animals don't, where you can slice a part off a plant and if you plant it carefully it will keep living and growing into a new plant pretty easy. People that make fruit and flowers and stuff love this, you can get a nice plant growing then slice parts off it forever and ever to make exact identical copies. So a lot of stuff like flowers and fruit are just 'cuttings' of other identical plants. Like we don't ever plant banana seeds, there is just one banana plant that everyone has copied over and over for decades.   </p>
<p>So some sorts of flowers, yeah, you could find the bush, but some are grafts or cuttings and are basically endless natural clones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A guy was suspected of having murdered a woman. There was a particular type of tree growing where her body was discovered, and seed pods from the same type of tree were found in the bed of his truck. Investigators got the DNA fingerprint of the seed pod and were able to match it to the tree growing at the crime scene, proving he had been there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. In fact, flowers are part of how plants have &quot;sex&quot;. Pollen can be thought of as a plant's sperm and when it's moved from flower to flower it allows for genes from one plant to mix with another. </p>
<p>Even fruits like oranges are from humans selectively breeding trees.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Of course they go. All living things have unique DNA. Although in case of plants it’s somewhat harder because they often can have natural clones and are often cloned in gardens. It’s very easy - for many plants if you cut off a branch and stick it into ground it will take root and make a clone of the original plant. If something like that happened then they would have identical DNA and genetically indistinguishable. If both plants grew naturally from seed though, then yes, you could identify them by DNA.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
