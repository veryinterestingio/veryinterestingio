		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A Nd:YAG laser is often used as as it can make \~10 nanosecond pulses at low frequency. (so it compresses all your power into a few short burst of very high power). Example: A 4W laser pulsed at 10Hz with a 10 ns pulse gives a 40 MW intensity during the pulse. Incidentally, this is why pulsed laser are so dangerous compared to continuous lasers.   </p>
<p>A Nd:YAG produces 1064 nm light (near IR). High power 1064 nm is very dangerous to work with as you cant see the beam, or reflections etc easily. So, if the wavelength isn't particularly important to the application, most applications will convert to the second harmonic of 1064nm.  The second harmonic of 1064 (nonlinear optics) is 532 nm light (green!) Thus you often get green lasers for very high intensity applications.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The green light also interacts with air (&amp; contaminates contained therein) and makes a good choice of wavelength (i.e., it's color) when you want to see the beam in air (such as outdoor star parties). It also helps that the human eye is most sensitive to green wavelengths (\~100x more in some cases).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lasers come in different wavelengths. The wavelength is produced by a active laser medium or laser gain medium. This can be a solid, liquid or gas, that when excited releases energy in the form of photons in that specific wavelength. In the case of where you are citing, the wavelength happens to fall into the visible light spectrum that you recognize as the color green.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Why do you see powerful lasers more often as green? More often than not, costs, how common they are and the limitations of other types of lasers. Specific lasers are used for specific purposes, there can be exciting aspects of a particular resonance frequency that corresponds with a specific wavelength produced by a laser. However, I'm thinking that green lasers look cool, they photograph well, the reasons stated at the beginning of this paragraph and what you are actually perceiving is a publication bias.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
