		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Reddit, my name is Phoebe Stubblefield! I am a forensic anthropologist, a research assistant scientist and interim director of the C. A. Pound Human Identification Lab at the University of Florida. During the centennial of the Tulsa Race Massacre, I will continue to excavate with the Physical Investigation Team at the Oaklawn Cemetery in Tulsa, Oklahoma to identify victims from the violence in 1921.</p>
<p>I'm here to answer your questions about the intersection of cultural anthropology with forensic sciences and our work in uncovering some of the history behind the Tulsa Race Massacre, a devastating attack on what was once known as Tulsa's thriving Black Community.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/UFExplore/status/1392870695516790786?s=20" target="_blank">Proof!</a></p>
<p>My research interests at the University of Florida are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Human skeletal variation</li>
<li>Human identification</li>
<li>Paleopathology</li>
<li>Forensic anthropology</li>
</ul>
<p>More about me: In 2002, I received my Ph.D. in Anthropology from the University of Florida where I was the last graduate student of Dr. William R. Maples, founder of the C.A. Pound Human ID Lab. As an associate professor at the University of North Dakota for 12 years, I directed the Forensic Science Program, created a trace evidence teaching laboratory and helped undergraduate students learn more about careers in forensic science. I have also served as forensic consultant for the North Dakota State Historical Society, the North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and with different medical examiner
districts throughout Florida.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for joining us here in AskScience! How do you go about identifying particular victims in a setting like this? Is it context + the general info you can get from the skeleton like gender, height, and age range? Or is there more detailed info you can get from individual skeletons that narrow down the identity of the remains to a specific person who we know was murdered in this event?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I mean from the the actual human moment you have when interacting with a deceased person? Do you have support when you need it? Does your profession have things in place to prepare you for that? Are you expected to just toughen up? Do you get mad at people who did things in the history youâ€™re discovering?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>I had to do a doubletake when I saw your photo on my feed. You're one of the people I respect most in our field and seeing you promote science education through non-traditional channels affirms this. </p>
<p>Does you contract have restrictions on the depth of your analysis? For instance stopping at the biological profile or do you plan to incorporate evidence of embodied structural violence (if present) or cultural context to help in identification for this and or subsequent publications?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
