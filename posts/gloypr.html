Is there enough breathable air in an exhalation for this to last indefinitely, or would CO2 toxicity slowly build up?</title>

This isn't good for you. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/124389.html" target="_blank">This source</a> says signs of intoxication appear at this concentration after 30 minutes, and loss of consciousness occurs if it goes much higher.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well anatomic deadspace, which doesn't participate in gas exchange, is about 150mL so if person 2 only exhaled that much into person 1 and then exhaled the rest elsewhere...they would essentially be exhaling fresh (warm, humidified) air into person 1.  Granted they'd have to do do this 3 to 4 times for each of person 1's normal breaths so I'm not sure about the logistics or person 2's physical conditioning.  Fun thought exercise though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly an answer to your question, but practically person 1 shouldnâ€™t truly inhale the air into her lungs before blowing it into the person 2 her mouth. If person 1 would simply keep the fresh air in her mouth and blow that into person 2 her mouth it should work much longer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my swimming lessons way-back-when (the 1970's ) I witnessed a demonstration of this.</p>
<p>There was one person laying on their back on the bottom of the pool in the shallow end ( chest deep). They were holding a weight to stay down.  There were two other people standing beside one on the left and one on the right.</p>
<p>The two standing people were taking a breath and then alternately doing mouth-to-mouth with the person in the water to transfer the air. </p>
<p>So this was transferring air twice as fast as one person could do it.  </p>
<p>But this demonstration went on for some time, like several minutes.  It was obvious that they could have done it indefinitely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
