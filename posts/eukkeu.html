		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Free mobile games make money primarily in three different ways: </p>
<p>(1) offering in-app purchases usually used by their ‘whales’ (i.e - 20% of their customers who spend a significant amount of money on the game and keep it alive for the rest of the non paying users).</p>
<p>Edit: Just wanted to clarify that the 20% isn’t supposed to be an exact figure, it’s a reference to the <a href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/understanding-the-pareto-principle-the-8020-rule/" target="_blank">Pareto principle</a> also known as the law of the vital few. I’m aware that the actual amount of users who pay can be significantly fewer.</p>
<p>(2) Is by running ads, usually bought as a advertising package (meaning you don’t have to you choose a specific game to advertise on you can just specify which customers you aim to target and how much your company is willing to spend on it and it is accordingly shown to such users. Alternatively, if your game if quite similar to another one in the App Store, you can specifically target that app as you might find a lot of users with the same interest all conveniently in one place) and shown to you based on your past user data and preferences from the App Store. They always make sure to give you the option to remove ads with a small fee - which appeals to our human need to remove a ‘pain point’ (an inbuilt aspect in many free to play mobile games that slows down the player or tries to push them towards making paid purchases - these include things like in-game wait timers). </p>
<p>(3) That other major way they make money is buy selling your user data to other third parties (businesses) as user data is an extremely powerful tool for companies to have because it allows them to understand you and how to market and target you as a customer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In game purchases are the primary income stream for that kind of game. Advertising is a thing too - last quarter <a href="https://investor.zynga.com/financial-information/quarterly-results" target="_blank">Zynga reported 18% of revenue in advertising</a> - but it's not what the business is built on.   </p>
<p>It's worth remembering that a large portion of the income in this kind of in game purchase comes from a small portion of the player base, which is often <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S-DGTBZU14" target="_blank">directly targeted with addictive mechanisms</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked in the mobile free to play industry. The current answers I see don't reflect what I experienced.</p>
<p>Ads are nearly worthless. Usually 1 to 2 cents per view. So if we have a user base of 5000 active users a day and they each watch 5 ads it's $250. Which is not terrible but that number is basically the maximum many dev studios would see.</p>
<p>And more importantly ads give resources without training purchasing behavior which is discouraged. You will often see limits on the number of ads you can volunteer to watch for instance. This is because it's not valuable to allow you to farm currency that way. It's a supplemental income, not the main focus.</p>
<p>Whaling would be a great term for how free to play games actually make their money.</p>
<p>99% of a studios income will be from a very small percentage of the userbase. These people are the whales, they spend literally thousands to tens of thousands of dollars on free to play games. They do this because free to play games focus on including every single mechanic they can to encourage addictive behavior. With many strategies pulled right out of casino textbooks.</p>
<p>It's very important to gate time. You can't have people burning through content. So time sinks need to be made. All resources are monitored to make sure that their are good gold/gem sinks. So that players are properly on the verge of just having enough to push them to buy more.</p>
<p>Also it is very important to encourage purchasing as early as possible to normalize the behavior. You'll be given premium currency as part of the FTUE (first time user experience) and this will maximize the likely hood that you will be tempted to purchase more premium currency.</p>
<p>Lots of people will spend a few dollars here or there. But all of the players that spend a reasonable amount combined likely do not add up to what the biggest whale is spending.</p>
<p>So when trying to understand these markets, remember they are whaling industries trying to land the big one. This is why so much of what they do seems so unappealing. They don't care about you shrimp, because the whales 'love' it. (Or at least they will drop their money endlessly and that's the important bit.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
