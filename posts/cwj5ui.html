		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can't have an explosion without oxygen. Gas pipes are full solely of gas, and they're also really quite tough. You have oxygen at the end of the pipe, so you might get a fire at the end, but the oxygen won't burrow down into the pipe because the hot gasses (CO2 and water) that are bursting out of the end of the pipe don't let anything else come back the other way. As a result, gas pipes tend to just keep a small flame at the end of them during a fire, rather than having the fire chase down the entire pipe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Firefighter here.  Among the other very good answers others have provided about the natural gas industry safety practices.  It should also be noted that one of the very first things we do is cut utilities to the structure involved in the incident.</p>
<p>The Incident Commander determines if they want us to stretch hose to fight the fire. (You all would be shocked what we can do with a water extinguisher only.) At the same time he orders the stretch he will order a unit to find and disconnect all power and gas utilities.  To avoid fueling the fire and eliminate the electrocution risk to the hose team.  Because it's just not possible to operate a hose line without getting wet.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thefirestore.com/store/product.aspx/productId/10776/Channellock-The-87-Rescue-Tool/" target="_blank">This is a tool every member of my department carries in their PPE.</a>  You can see it includes a handy gas-valve wrench slot to accurately shut off standard gas-safety valves.  The link includes a video to show you how we shut off a gas valve.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The gas has to be mixed with oxygen to be flammable. The gas in the pipe is of too high concentration to burn. Gas has to be with in certain flammable limits or concentrations to burn. </p>
<p>Also most residential gas service has an over flow check valve that will &quot;trip&quot; or engage if too much gas begins to flow to the home.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
