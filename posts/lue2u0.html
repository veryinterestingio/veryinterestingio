<p>The problem is that we've created an environment in which bees die. You can create more colonies but that doesn't change the fact that we place those colonies in a very hostile environment for bees.</p>
<p>And not just bees really. People overstate the importance of bees and massively understate the importance of insects in general. And insect populations as a whole have plummeted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Afaik the issues for bees include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Being poisoned by bee-unfriendly pesticides sprayed on crops.</p>
</li>
<li>Not having enough to eat. A huge field of wheat can't feed a bee. A bee can't make it across that stretch of hundreds of acres without dropping from exhaustion because they've had no food to sustain them in the meanwhile. The same in residential areas: most people favour big sterile grass lawns (no food for bees), pebble gardens or paving (definitely no food for bees). And people that do plant flowers don't necessarily choose bee friendly options. The showiest, prettiest flowers are often double petalled which stops bees from getting into the middle of the flower where the nectar is. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=single+petal+rose&amp;safe=strict&amp;client=ms-android-samsung-rev2&amp;source=android-browser&amp;prmd=sivn&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk01LACnIG-0GLsN5Or5lRQZ-8cNJjA:1614519570461&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjLnOuL2ozvAhXWZxUIHRpsBR8Q_AUoAnoECAsQAg&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=572&amp;dpr=3#imgrc=whxaJuAlBOt99M" target="_blank">This flower is a rose.</a> It's the kind of rose bees like. But most people don't want that kind of rose in their garden. In fact, a lot of people wouldn't even be able to identify that flower as a rose. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=david+austin+rose&amp;safe=strict&amp;client=ms-android-samsung-rev2&amp;prmd=sinv&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk00ihGLyvaL2qQpYWxFnvtbU35_qCw:1614519198129&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=572&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwid6u_b2IzvAhWBtHEKHfNKCQoQ_AUIBg#imgrc=WYwdKogzZJKpBM" target="_blank">This is the kind of rose that most people think of when they decide to put flowers in their garden</a>. But bees don't really like that type of rose, even though it might look prettier to you and me.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some Bee keepers raise queens and sell them, and is a bigger source of revenue than honey.  A local keeper even uses artificial insemination to get the quality's they want. ( Used to buy a queen for 7-10 dollars, now 40-60 dollars)  I keep bees and often buy queens to split my hives, the queens are sent to me in the mail.  In the 70's I lost very few hives, this year I have lost 3 out of 8 hives I had last summer.  We can get all the queens you want, but you can't control what gets sprayed on the farmers fields.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We do breed bee's en masse but domesticated bee's aren't the bee's that are in danger of extirpation or extinction in most areas. It's things like solitary bee's or certain species of bumble bee's which are in danger.</p>
<p>Much of the issue is habitat loss and conflicts with humans which aren't easily resolved even if we kept breeding and releasing bee's</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're missing the actual issue. Beekeepers already do that. Our problem on the commercial side is that colonies ate getting harder to maintain. Every year 20+ percent losses are becoming standard. I personally had a great winter season and still lost 15%. It's expensive and time consuming to rebuild those colonies.</p>
<p>The bigger problem ecologically is that the mix of monocultures, pesticide, fungicide,and herbicide use, and the advent of varroa mites are killing native bee populations, and there's no commercial scale operation to rebuild those, because they operate different conditions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
