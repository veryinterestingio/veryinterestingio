		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I earned my undergrad degree in astrophysics at the University of Belgrade, Serbia, in 1999, and then I did my PhD in astronomy at Cornell University in 2005. I specialize in the orbital dynamics of solar system bodies, using their present orbit to figure out their past history. I usually use computer simulations, and my job involves quite a bit of programming. Back in graduate school I discovered the BYORP effect, which is driven by solar radiation and which changes the orbits of small binary asteroids very quickly (astronomically speaking). In 2012, Sarah Stewart and I had a paper in Science where we proposed that Earth was spinning very fast when the moon-forming collision happened, which made it possible to make the moon from Earth's material. My part was to show how Earth could lose excess spin afterwards through complex interactions between the Sun and the Moon. In 2016, I revisited this issue and found that early Earth was probably not only spinning super fast but also had a large axial tilt. I have also worked on the dynamics of Saturn's moons, and I proposed in 2016 that Saturn's inner moons and rings are probably only about 100 million years old. Cassini spacecraft results later suggested this is indeed the case, at least for the rings. My latest paper is on the past orbits of Martian moons Phobos and Deimos, and how the orbit of Deimos makes sense only if Mars had a large ring about 3 billion years ago.</p>
<p>I will be on at 11am PDT (2 PM ET, 18 UT), AMA!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, Matija. Thanks for the AMA. I have a couple of questions:</p>
<p>- can your models indicate if there were other major interactions between Earth and other massive objects besides the one that led to the creation of the moon? How big does an object have to be in order to influence Earth's orbital dynamics?</p>
<p>- I recall that gravitational interactions of multiple, or even 3 bodies were quite difficult to model? Is this still true or has there been advancement on this recently? I recall there were also people at the University of Belgrade researching 3-body interactions.</p>
<p>Greetings from another University of Belgrade graduate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for joining us here on AskScience! We know that the variations in Earth's orbital parameters are one of the primary driver behind natural climate cycles (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles" target="_blank">Milankovitch cyles</a> for others reading this comment and not sure what I'm talking about) and there are lots of efforts out there to compare cyclicity we see in the stratigraphic record to orbital cyclicity and/or use orbital cyclicity to interpret cycles we see in the stratigraphy (i.e. 'astronomical tuning', e.g. <a href="http://www.geology.wisc.edu/~smeyers/pubs/Zeeden_et_al_2015.pdf" target="_blank">Zeeden et al, 2015</a>). Most of what I've seen is focused on the Cenozoic or Quaternary, but every once and a while I see someone trying to interpret cyclicity in 'deep time' records, e.g. Paleozoic age stratigraphy, etc, in terms of orbital cyclicity. So, my questions are (1) how far back can we accurately reconstruct orbital cycles for use in this type of effort and (2) assuming at the moment that the accuracy breaks down past some geological time period, what are the barriers to pushing back further (or is there just not enough data to do this with confidence beyond a certain threshold)?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
