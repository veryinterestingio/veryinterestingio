		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A bit of a different viewpoint here from a software programmer. There's an interesting concept that I deal with in computer science called information theory and it affects things like how much zip files can shrink data.  </p>
<p>The idea is that if something is very repetitious then you can shrink it by writing a program to write it for you. So if you press C# five hundred times, instead of writing &quot;C#, C#, C#...&quot; which would take a lot of text, you can write &quot;C# * 500&quot; which is a small bit of text. On the other hand if something is very random, then there's not really any way to write such a program as there's no pattern to take advantage of.  </p>
<p>This concept of compressibility creates a spectrum. On the one side you have content with lots of compressibility - think Mary Had a Little Lamb or Fa Re Mi So La Ti Do. This content is not pleasing to our brain as while it is patterns they are not very interesting and thus can be considered &quot;boring&quot;. On the other side you have content with little compressibility - such as if someone mashed the piano keys. This content is not pleasing to our brain as there are no patterns to it and thus can be considered &quot;noisy&quot;.</p>
<p>So what does our brain want? It wants information in the form of interesting patterns. These types of sounds exist in the middle of the compressibility spectrum, which is where what we consider music is located. My suspicion is that even different genres are related to this concept, but that different people like different parts of the spectrum. Classical music would be in the lower end of the middle of the spectrum, which is why some people find it boring. Heavy metal would be in the higher end of the middle of the spectrum, which is why some people find it noisy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m a music teacher, but this is all anecdotal. I think music tastes depend on a lot of factors. Some personality traits lend themselves to liking certain types of music, but I think the biggest factor is just exposure.</p>
<p>Popular artists are largely determined by who the music labels decide to push and get radio play. If you hear an artist or genre a lot, most people start to like it, at least on a surface level (not everyone). For instance, I’ve always disliked country music, but my wife listens to that shit constantly. It’s alright I guess.</p>
<p>For me personally, it’s less about genre and more about particular components. I like faster tempo, minor keys, and unexpected chordal progressions. You can find those components within just about any genre in a particular song.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The biggest factor is culture and exposure. After that, the things that make you unique play a role, too. </p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, people in China tend to prefer Chinese music. People who prefer gospel tend to be religious. Country music is more popular in the west and the south of the US. Hip Hop is more popular on the coasts. </p>
<p>There’s an undeniable role that community, culture and exposure play. It’s not just music either. Tastes tend to trend culturally. </p>
<p>When I was in high school I was a “rock” kid and I was definitely not a “rap” kid. This was among the most important things to me and my identity at the time. When I met someone who liked my kind of music I tended to believe that they were more likely to be like me. </p>
<p>It’s no coincidence that people will often reference music that came out when they were between the ages of 14-20 as “good music” and everything since then doesn’t live up. This has everything to do with the importance of new music to young people and much, much less to do with the quality of the music at the time. As someone who lived through countless Sheryl Crow albums, believe me, the music from the past isn’t necessarily ‘better’. But I digress. </p>
<p>I think in general we tend to underestimate the impact the people around us have on our tastes. I would guess that this is true because we want to believe we all come to who we are on our own. And that we aren’t actually just bits and pieces of the people we observe and emulate around us. But there’s nothing wrong with that at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think two of the biggest factors are exposure and emotional attatchment.</p>
<p>Think of musical tastes like a network of roads in a town. If there's a particular route you have to take every day, twice a day, your going to be able to point out every little detail, side road, store, house, and whatever on that route - unlike a road you're only taking once where all that stuff is ignored and you basically are just trying to get where you're going. That's exposure.
Now let's say there's two routes you're really familiar with. One goes east, but you know the dentist's office is east and you hate the dentist, you'll associate the two and unconsciously just kinda hate travelling east. But your favorite restaurant where you meet your friends is to the west, so you begin to just love the western route itself (regardless of whether you're going to the restaurant or not.) That's the emotional attatchment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
