How are Neanderthals and Homo sapiens separate species if we know that Homo sapiens have Neanderthal DNA? Wouldn’t the inheriting of DNA require the mating and production of fertile offspring?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The species concept in general is pretty fuzzy.  The Linnaean system is ultimately based in a pre-evolution mindset and is not fully compatible with our modern understanding.  But, it's useful, so we keep it around.</p>
<p>To get a bit more to the science, while we do know that anatomically modern humans and neanderthals did manage to interbreed, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4072735/" target="_blank">notable low rates of neanderthal genes in certain areas of the genome, particularly the X-chromosome, suggest that male inheritors of Neanderthal genes may have had elevated rates of fertility problems.</a>  These types of fertility issues are not uncommon when you have two species that can interbreed to produce offspring.  Tigers and lions are something of a classic example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depending on how you divide them up there are ~4-5 main species concepts. The idea of breeding and producing fertile offspring is really only present in one of them. </p>
<p>The others more or less revolve around some form of isolation (time, space, reproductive selection) that prevents individuals from mating even though they’d be biologically able to. </p>
<p>Examples include things such as biologically compatible animals that don’t recognize each other’s mating calls. Biologically compatible plants that flower at different times preventing pollination. And separate groups of biological compatible species that occur in geographically distant areas where they would not normally interbreed under most circumstances and begin to accumulate evolutionary differences while remaining biologically compatible. </p>
<p>These species concepts tend to be a bit more fluid, as typically they’re interrelated (eg some sort of geographical isolation leading to a different mating call or flowering behavior that then prevents interbreeding when the two populations are once again in close proximity).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The book you are reading sounds either simplifying, or outdated. Consider a ring species: sub-species A and B can breed, B and C can breed, but A can't breed with C. Meanwhile D can breed with both A and C, but not B. Animal groups like this exist.</p>
<p>If the definition were as basic as the book suggests, then those animal groups (A, B, C, D) would be simultaneously the same species and also not the same species. The definition isn't fully compatible with observation.</p>
<p>Nature doesn't care about our tidy categories and simplifications :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some people have suggested that Neanderthals are actually a subspecies of humans for this exact reason. (Humans would be classified as Homo Sapiens Sapiens and Neanderthals would be Homo Sapiens Neanderthalensis.) However, like the other commenter already mentioned, there's evidence that humans and neanderthals weren't completely compatible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>species aren't so simply differentiated outside of academic fictions, plenty of related species produce viable offspring, it doesn't mean that, say, polar bears and grizzly bears aren't seperate species.</p>
<p>the classification of neanderthals and modern humans is debated.  Some anthropologists define them as homo sapiens neanderthalenis and homo sapiens sapiens, 2 of the sub-species of homo sapiens rather than seperate species.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
