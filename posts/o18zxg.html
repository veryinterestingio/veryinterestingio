		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It goes from the generic to the specific. O Bachelor's is supposed to give you broad knowledge within a couple of realms of knowledge, as well as skills to look for more knowledge as needed. A Master's is supposed to provide you with mastery of a specific field, as comprised by advanced topics in that field as well as advanced skills in analysis, critical thinking and evaluation. A PhD is supposed to provide you with expert knowledge of a very narrow part of a field, and the tools to create new knowledge in that field through research.</p>
<p>EDIT: I like <a href="https://www.happyschools.com/bachelors-vs-masters-vs-phd/" target="_blank">this visual explanation</a></p>
<p>EDIT 2: I thought I'd share the link to <a href="https://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/" target="_blank">the original source of that visual</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a master's in computer science so I can explain some:</p>
<p>A Bachelor's requires you to take classes to understand a breadth of material. In my computer science degree, I not only learned general programming, I also learned about hardware, Assembly Language, operating systems, programming language grammars, design philosophies of building software for a client, datastructures, algorithms, and so on.</p>
<p>A Master's degree is a blend of some advanced classes and a thesis, which is some unique research that you do on a specific topic. A thesis consists of a few main parts: an introduction that includes the topic at hand, related research that other people have done, the new work that you have done which includes experiments, tables, figures, algorithms, formulas, and so on, and a conclusion that summarizes what you have learned.</p>
<p>Where I went there were two options, one that focused on the classes and one of that focused on the thesis. The class focused one (which I took) had the thesis be one semester, and the thesis was around 70 pages or so, and at the end you get two professors to read it and approve it. The thesis focused one had the thesis be two semesters. The first is focused on writing the thesis, while the second is focused on defending it in front of a panel of professors where you explain it in person and have to actively defend it, and at the end each professor gives you a yes or a no and you need a certain number of yes's to pass.</p>
<p>A PhD continues from the master's degree, but instead of spending a semester or two on your thesis alongside classes, you spend years focusing on nothing else as it involves no further classes. A master's thesis involves using existing research to cobble together a new idea. A PhD thesis involves becoming the world expert on that idea and becoming a world expert on anything related to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
