		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe/yes but the effect is much smaller and the time frame for it is likely limited. Sperm only provides genetic material while the egg provides the mitochondria/cell machinery and the females body hosts the fetus. So right way the only possible mechanisms through which male diet/alcohol intake can affect their offspring is genetic (through germ line mutation) or <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics" target="_blank">epigenetic</a> (through changes in modifications to DNA and histone proteins).</p>
<p>Alcohol and its metabolites as well as other mutagens from diet can increase the rate of mutation potentially increasing the risk of germ line mutations that could lead to disease of the offspring. However mutation rates are still very low and we have evolved many mechanisms to keep mutation to a minimum. </p>
<p>More interestingly imo are the epigenetic effects. Alcohol can alter the epigenome and gene expression without changing DNA. Altering how accessible a gene is (through modifications on top of DNA/chromatin) can effectively turn a gene on or off. There is also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515627/#idm140346926336112title" target="_blank">research that suggests that males can pass on alcohol induced epigenetic changes to their offspring</a> however it is important to note that these studies were conducted in animals. Whether or not humans pass on their epigenome is somewhat debated however animal models do provide very strong evidence for it. </p>
<p>To make things even more interesting sperm cells turn over very quickly so a males diet/alcohol use more than a few months before the child is conceived may not matter much as the sperm altered then will have been replaced.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Someone above mentioned epigenetics. That's important. </p>
<p>The reason alcohol is dangerous during pregnancy is mainly due to the fetus and mother sharing a blood supply. The intermediary between these is the placenta, which filters out a lot of maternal blood products, but unfortunately isn't able to filter out alcohol. So the delicate developing brain is bathed in alcohol, which is what causes developmental issues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
