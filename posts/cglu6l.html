<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Edit:
Thanks for all the insightful responses.</p>
<p>Consensus seems to be that nutrients are important, especially in the infantile and adolescent stages, but macronutrients/calories are probably more important in adults when at least some micronutrients are coming in. And they’re probably coming in approximately satisfactory amounts if caloric needs are being met, unless you live off junk food.</p>
<p>Some caloric restriction as an adult can be beneficial and eating “healthy” is better.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tough to find any specific research...</p>
<p>Everything I can find is what we often consider &quot;common knowledge&quot;. Infants (0-5 years old) from low socio-economic-status often are more at risk from malnourishment, but pretty much everything specifically call out micro nutrients (folic acid, vitamin A, iron).</p>
<p>The rest of the literature that goes beyond infancy also focuses on micros, again with folic acid, fatty acids, vitamins A, C, B(6 and 12).</p>
<p>My guess is that you would have to first define &quot;calorie deficit&quot;. If you are 600 pounds, with 500 calories daily deficit, your cognitive abilities being affected is more likely caused by sugar/food withdrawal than neuron formation.</p>
<p>If you are a grown 6' adult at 80 lbs, a macro deficiency most likely includes a micro deficiency.</p>
<p>The other factor is age. While it is possible to form neural connections as an adult, deficiencies will far greatly affect an infant more than an adult. Teenagers would be a grey area, but since the brain is still being developed into the 20's, I imagine it would also be affected.</p>
<p>Edit: also, it's very possible to reach healthy macro <em>and</em> micro targets and still be at a caloric deficit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Excuse my poor formatting, I do not post here often.Your proposed questions are very broad and difficult to answer; a larger amount of context is required for a definitive &quot;Yes or no&quot; style answer.</p>
<p>I will attempt to answer what I can.</p>
<p>A major issue here is that dietary requirements, both macro and micro differ between age groups, as well as the susceptibility of neuronal disease in those age groups. Some studies ( <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2018.02.052" target="_blank"><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2018.02.052" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2018.02.052</a></a> ) indicate that an over supply of calories may impair cognition, but it is mostly due to the composition of the food that is eaten even if the individual is healthy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, my statement on age groups, although this research may be mildly questionable. Supplementation of creatine on elderly individuals will improve* cognitive performance, however generally has no impact on the cognitive performance of younger individuals ( <a href="https://doi-org/10.1080/13825580600788100" target="_blank"><a href="https://doi-org/10.1080/13825580600788100" target="_blank">https://doi-org/10.1080/13825580600788100</a></a> ,</p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2008.05.009" target="_blank"><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2008.05.009" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2008.05.009</a></a>  ). Creatine is mildly relevant to the topic of caloric based deficiency as it is utilized within the phosphocreatine system in order to provide/improve energy for short term tasks - however this is a bit of a reach to answer your question.</p>
<p>QUICK EDIT::</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If being in a caloric/macronutrient deficit has a negative impact on  neurological processes, does meeting your micronutrient requirements  minimize that impact?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It definitely has a negative impact on neurological processes; in mouse models there is even a set circuitry that &quot;activates&quot; when in a starving state ( <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nn.4274" target="_blank"><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nn.4274" target="_blank">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nn.4274</a></a> ). Meeting the minimum required micronutrients may influence satiation and reduce the impact of this but I have no source for this.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is more important for the development of neurons under normal conditions? Macronutrients or micronutrients?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If conditions are 'normal' you would not be starving, therefore it would have to be micronutrients; see b12/iodine deficiency.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>what are the most important factors for the optimal function of neurological processes?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Likely sleep, you won't function well without it, and you won't live long when completely deprived of it. Both macro/micronutrient deficiencies take a while to kick in. If considering only dietary issues, then micronutrient deficiencies are most impactful on a developing brain (children), however starved of either style of nutrient will definitely result in some form of developmental issues (again b12/iodine deficiency).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I saw a programme on the BBC about fasting and its effects on the body and longevity (it's by the Dr who later published a book on the 5:2 diet). The studies and scientists he spoke to were all praising the effects of fasting as it lowered a growth hormone that can lead to higher rates of cancer. Another study he mentioned was that starvation seemed to increase neurological pathways in mice. Part of the reasoning for this was that cleverer mice were more likely too find food. At the time, I believe they hadn't researched into whether this was the same in humans or not, but the programme was filmed around 7 years ago so there may be more on it now. </p>
<p>Here's a like to the programme: (in case you can access the BBC) the bit on mice is in the last 10 minutes or so.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would imagine that it makes a big difference at infancy where neural pathways are still heavily in development. Research has shown kids with low food security or malnourishment struggle in academics so there may be correlation there. But for adults, when your at a caloric deficit that doesn't mean you're not getting the fuel you need, it just means that you're having to use stored energy instead of food energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know much about building and pruning connections, but I do work in a neuroscience lab where we are in part interested in how metabolism affects neurotransmission. The primary job of a neuron is to communicate with other neurons. This is a job the neuron can perform up to hundreds of times per second. The communication mechanism relies on a hair trigger than when the action potential arrives, causes the immediate exocytosis of neurotransmitter into the synapse. Presynaptic neurons then recycle their vesicles through a couple different routes of endocytosis. This vesicle recovery and filling (with neurotransmitter ultimately) process is costly in terms of ATP, which the neurons synthesize mostly from glucose they get extracellularly. If you reduce the availability of glucose, the neuron loses the ability to efficiently recycle it's vesicles. So during rapid firing, there quickly become fewer vesicles ready to prime and fire, and the neuron finds it much harder to send neurotransmitter for every incoming action potential. However, it can still function as the neuron moves to rely on OxPhos for energy. Shutting down OxPhos while simultaneously shutting down glycolysis drastically disrupts neuronal function. Keep in mind this is all going on at 1 synapse. There are 86 billion neurons in an average person, each neuron can make 1-10k connections with other neurons, making somewhere between 10 - 1000 trillion synapses with these energy requirements. With this in mind it starts to make sense how the brain can only account for 2% of body weight and 20% of total energy. (Ashrafi and Ryan 2017)</p>
<p>Interestingly your body works really really hard to ensure that your brain has the glucose it needs at the detriment of other organs first. Consider when you go to the doctor and they want to measure your blood sugar. They ask you to fast for 12-24 hours so they can get a 'resting' blood sugar. In this regime your body hasn't seen food in a while, but works hard to ensure your blood sugar doesn't drop below 40 mg/dl (This is where you get into insulin shock). Normal operating behavior is around 80 - 120 mg/dl, with healthy fasting values sitting below 100 mg/dl. So if your blood sugar levels drop by a factor of 2, you're in serious jeopardy, if they increase up to 120 mg/dl, you run the risk of increased disease. My point here is that this is a very tightly controlled value that your body works really hard to keep within a tight range. </p>
<p>This is important because when you go into a caloric deficit, your body is unable to make all the atp it needs. So in the same way that when you get cold your fingers lose circulation first, your body decided to play favorites with the resources and organs. Here your body prioritizes brain function through constant blood sugar levels produced by the liver through gluconeogensis. In this way your body takes excess energy stores from other parts of your body, converts to glucose in the liver, exports that to the blood, which will then deliver a steady supply of glucose to your brain, where it will continue to function in it's normal (but probably hangry) state. </p>
<p>This is very different from asking how does a child growing up in a caloric deficient environment compare to one that does not and I don't mean to speculate on that at all. This is just a look at neuronal function when you limit energetics and a quick comment on how the body works to avoid that limit at all costs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
