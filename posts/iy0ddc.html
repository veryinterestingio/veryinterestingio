<p>This feeling that we get comes from the reduction in blood flow to the large intestine. Your body doesn’t necessarily know the difference between good exciting and bad exciting. When you become anxious, you have a nervous system response. This releases adrenaline into your body. All kinds of things happen, but most importantly, the nutrient and oxygen rich blood is shunted towards more important areas, digestion slows. When you lose blood flow to your large intestine, you feel “butterflies”.</p>
<p>It’s like your stomach knows it’s being shorted, and throws out nerve signals in a fit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is an excerpt from the book How To Survive by John Hudson. Just thought it'd be better not to paraphrase it. So here it is:</p>
<p>&quot;It’s also worth keeping in mind that it’s not just your brain that is affected. The nerves that radiate out from your spinal cord go all over your body, transmitting information about you and the world around you to and from your brain and organs. When we are in dangerous situations, like being too close to a predator (or a bathrobe that looks like one), part of this network, the catchily titled ‘sympathetic autonomic nervous system’, kicks in.</p>
<p>You’ve probably heard of it before as the ‘fight, flight or freeze’ reaction. It prepares your body for immediate action by dilating your pupils to capture more information visually, and dilating the bronchia in your lungs, which increases your intake of oxygen. </p>
<p>It accelerates your heart rate to push more oxygen-rich blood to your muscles, makes you sweat to prevent overheating, and ups the secretion of adrenaline. It also stops your body wasting energy on functions that won’t be needed in an emergency –it inhibits digestion, reduces saliva production, and stops other ‘secondary’muscle functions, notably in the bladder and bowels. </p>
<p>It’s also the reason behind the dry mouth and butterflies that you feel when you’re confronting something stressful, like a job interview or giving an important presentation.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
