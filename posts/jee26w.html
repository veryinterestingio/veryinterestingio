		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The largest lobster ever found was 44 pounds. The oldest known lobster in captivity was 22 pounds and 132-140 years old. I give those two data points as reference, so when you ask why no one tried growing one to be huge it would depend on why someone would want to do that. For commercial purposes most people donâ€™t want to buy a 20 pound lobster, and the amount of time it takes to grow a 3 pound lobster is significantly less than growing a 20 pound lobster when you factor in grow costs. If you meant just for the sheer monument of growing a huge lobster, science behind lobsters growing without aging is relatively recent, so if it took 140 years to grow a 22 pound lobster, someone would have started growing a lobster hundreds of years ago, have someone keep taking care of it to truly see a massive lobster which would be unlikely</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareCubeLaw" target="_blank"><a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareCubeLaw" target="_blank">https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareCubeLaw</a></a></p>
<p>It's the square-cubed law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>When an object undergoes a proportional increase in size, its new  volume is proportional to the cube of the multiplier and its new surface  area is proportional to the square of the multiplier.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So tiny lobsters not only can hide from predators, but they need less food to eat and it's easier for them to molt.</p>
<p>Double the size and the volume  its surface area is quadrupled, and its volume is increased to <em>eight times</em> its original volume.</p>
<p>Even with water helping hold them up, they get to big to molt and now they have more tissue for disease and parasites to munch on.  They need more food to stay alive.</p>
<p>EDIT: from -<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobster" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobster" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobster</a></a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lobster longevity is limited by their size. Moulting requires metabolic  energy and the larger the lobster, the more energy is needed; 10 to 15%  of lobsters die of exhaustion during moulting, while in older lobsters,  moulting ceases and the exoskeleton degrades or collapses entirely  leading to death </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, even in perfect conditions - assuming you could feed the lobster medicine to prevent disease - the exoskeleton will degrade.  It's just too much for the poor thing to handle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
