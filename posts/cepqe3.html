		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there are a <em>lot</em> of factors at play here so I'm skipping a fair bit. The current theory of how gold seams form is as follows:</p>
<p>Deep underground, a lot of minerals are fairly homogenously dissolved in groundwater and, because it's underground, this water is at extremely high pressure (3000 atmospheres). Earthquakes at these depths can cause fissures and cracks to open up between the rocks, and when this happens the pressure drops to close to 1 atmosphere. This causes the water to vaporise, depositing all the minerals dissolved in it onto the surrounding rock, gold included. </p>
<p>When the earthquake is over and pressure normalises, the water condenses and re-dissolves most of the minerals. Gold is not very soluble though, so it is less able to be re-absorbed and stays as a thin deposit on the rock. This process repeats over and over until a significant amount of gold has been deposited in a seam/vein.</p>
<p>At this point some kind of geological activity is required to bring the seam to, or close to, the surface. Earthquakes, plate tectonics, volcanoes, etc can all do this. It's no coincidence that the (well, a) gold rush occurred in California, an extremely earthquake-prone part of the world!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Geologist here, please ignore most of the previous replies apart from /u/interstellargator who explains crack-seal vein formation nicely.</p>
<p>Gold deposits are formed in many different ways, most of the time in gold mines you will never see the gold - it is contained microscopically within other minerals which need to be crushed up to recover it.</p>
<p>When you talk about gold veins you are probably talking about the classic movie style 'motherlode' vein where you see nice <a href="https://www.mining.com/rnc-minerals-recovers-giant-gold-slab-mine-australia/6/" target="_blank">big chunks of visible gold</a> hanging around in rocks. These types of veins are actually really common, they just don't tend to have gold in them. The veins form from hydrothermal processes, hydrothermal means hot 'water' (for want of a better word) which is loaded with salt, chlorine, sulphur, carbon dioxide and various acids. They are NOT magmatic (molten rock).</p>
<p>Hydrothermal fluids can come from a few different sources, the earth's mantle, crust, or surface and gold can be picked up by fluids originating from any of these sources! You just need to heat up the water, pressurise it, and get some nasty chemicals dissolved in it, this isn't hard when you start to circulate water around underground!</p>
<p>Fluids will travel through cracks and very small pores in the rocks and gradually the concentration of gold will increase as it dissolves it from the rocks it travels through (which may have 1 part per billion or less gold) or, if it is sourced from the mantle, the gold may already be dissolved in the fluid. Then, as the fluid circulates around something changes - it can be the pH of the fluid, the amount of oxygen, the temperature, and the gold will start to precipitate out.</p>
<p>Remember - at this point, the fluid is extremely high pressure, it is busting apart the rock and pushing through it, it starts to fill in - think of lime that builds up on your kettle or your showerhead, exactly the same idea but this is quartz and gold instead of carbonate. additionally, because pressures in the earth are enormous, this type of veining occurs quite shallowly in the top ~5km of the crust because otherwise the open spaces would be forced shut, deeper 'vein gold' occurrences you get from more of a crack-seal type of vein.</p>
<p>Finally, many people regard the most valuable type of gold vein to only exist on a website called 'Reddit' where a single inane comment will be 'gilded'. This is a rare occurrence just like the discovery of physical gold however the processes seem to be much the same albeit more of a social phenomenon than a chemical one. This inane comment will be followed by a 'chain-reaction' of replies generally along the lines of 'Nice' or 'F' and depending on the alcohol levels in the vein this can trigger what is known as a 'gold train' which is of course, as we all know, where the world famous 'Kind Stranger' nugget first originated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many have already given good answers, so I will just try to add something as I am currently working in gold exploration.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>One good way to think about concentrating gold in significant amounts is the classical 1. Source 2. Conduit 3. Trap model for the formation of ore deposits. The model suggests that in order to form economic concentrations of gold there is firstly a need to have a source site (or an area) where gold is concentrated in fluid solution (hot, saline mixture of vapor, liquid and metals). As an example you could have <strong>a rock unit deep underground</strong> (several kilometers) that is subjected to circulation of hot fluids which are able to dissolve gold from the rock and increase the gold concentration in the circulating fluids to 100x - 1000x of that of the source rock.  Here it is good to know that gold (as are most other elements too) is present almost in any kind of rock, but just in neglible amounts.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Secondly, a <strong>conduit</strong> is needed to transport the now gold enriched hot fluids to depths where gold precipitation is possible. Someone already mentioned earthquakes ,and fissures and cracks related to them, that are very effective in creating pathways for the fluids to flow. Geologically there are also several other ways to create different kinds of weakness surfaces in the bedrock that are used by the gold bearing fluids to rise up.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Finally, there must be a <strong>change</strong> <strong>in the prevailing conditions</strong> that act to destabilize the hot fluid (OR more precisely the chemical complexes within the fluid) that carries gold. Generally, three different mechanisms are responsible for gold precipitation: 1. Drop in pressure 2. Drop in temperature 3. Fluid chemistry change (mixing with other fluid, or contamination with reactive rock such as limestone/marble[ex. pH changes]). The process can be any single of the aforementioned or a combination of them, and if the change is strong enough gold 'simply' drops out of the solution a bit like a salt (NaCl) saturated water would precipitate salt on the bottom of a mug if the temperature is decreased.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Worth mentioning is that there might be just a single event that precipitates gold, or the formation of the gold deposit can happen in multiple phases or pulses.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
