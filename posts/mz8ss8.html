		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light moves at 186,000 miles per <em>second</em>. When you turn the lamp off, the light that it previously emitted continues to zoom away at that ridiculous speed.</p>
<p>Within a room, it bounces off of every surface, being partially absorbed and partially reflected on every bounce until it's either been completely absorbed or has escaped the room. Since it bounces around faster than you can imagine, it reaches that point of &quot;completely absorbed&quot; so quickly that it's essentially instant as you see it, so the room becomes dark &quot;immediately&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because we cannot create or destroy energy the light does ‘go’ somewhere. It bounces around the room briefly to fast for us to process so we just see a light room. But every time that light bounces of a surface some of the light energy is absorbed as heat into the surface. After a few bounces that light is entirely absorbed as heat by the walls and anything else it touches. This all happens to fast for us to see so we experience is as a briefly lit room before returning to darkness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light is constantly being absorbed by everything it hits. It mostly bounces off of white things and is mostly absorbed by dark things, but everything absorbs it at least a little bit. The only reason lights &quot;stay on&quot; is because they're constantly creating new light and some of that light is being absorbed by your eyes before everything else in the room takes it all.</p>
<p>When you turn off the light, it means the bulb stops producing new light. The light already in the room very quickly (although technically not instantaneously) gets absorbed by everything around it. When you turn the light back on, it starts generating new light again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's important to take a moment to really appreciate just how insanely fast light speed is. Light travels at (roughly) 300,000,000 meters per second (or about a billion feet per second). If you are in a room that is 5x5 meters (~15x15 feet), then a photon will take 0.0000000017 seconds to travel across the room once. This is 17 <strong>billionths</strong> of 1 second. The human brain perceives things on the millisecond scale (not sure how fast visual information is processed though). Light is about 5 orders of magnitude faster than our brain can process. This means light would have to bounce around tens of thousands of times for us to perceive it dimming. Our best mirrors can't even get close to that.</p>
<p>Light is so fast that it's difficult to even fully intuit just how fast it really is. So, what everyone else said: It gets absorbed instantly as far as your brain is concerned.</p>
