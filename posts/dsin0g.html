		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bones do heal, so if there is any sign of healing or regrowth it pretty definitively happened prior to death. Color of the break on the bones can also be an indication. (edit to add that I didn't put any detail as to why color matters, but some very helpful other posters went into more detail below. Whether or not blood is still flowing at the time of injury and outside contaminants such as dirt will impact bone coloring) </p>
<p>Bones after death are also drier and more brittle and as a result tend to shatter, so the fracture will look different.</p>
<p>Each of these things can arise from other scenarios or can be unclear, but multiple signs all pointing to the same conclusion are usually a good indication if it is a ante-mortem or post-mortem injury.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answers you have so far are pretty incomplete, so I'll try to explain in in an ELI15 way. This is a field involving trauma analysis in forensic archaeology/anthropology or palepathology. I'm assuming you are asking how we tell the difference between antemortem (before death), perimortem (at the time of death) and postmortem (after death) injuries. </p>
<p>On a basic level, what some other people were saying is correct. Bone is a living tissue and will show signs of bone repair in the skull. Fracture edges will appear rounded and smooths, and broken pieces may be rejoined in antemortem fractures. There may be a large depressed area of bone and fracture line near the impact site.</p>
<p>Perimortem injuries can have similar bone breakage patterns to antemortem trauma, but show no signs of healing. Since the bone is green/fresh/wet bone when the trauma occurs, the fracture edges are shapr and clean - not jagged or torn like dry (postmortem) bone breaks. Blunt force trauma can leave indents of the of the weapon used to inflict the mark. This is especially true, since surrounding tissue and the brain can prevent the skull from shattering.</p>
<p>Postmortem trauma is typically caused by the environment, like damage from carnivores or rodents, or being compressed by soil. Bone can also become damaged from decay, sun, heat, moisture, etc. No healing is evident, and the bone is dry and more brittle. As a result, dry bone fractures are typically more jagged or torn, with random breakage patterns. More like you would see in a ceramic pot or something. The fracture edges are also typically lighter in color, since they have been exposed to the elements for a shorter period of time than the surrounding skull (think when you move a piece of furniture and the carpet underneath looks cleaner). There are some other ways, but that's a basic overview. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even bone will heal. And when bone heal it will round off any sharp edges. By looking at how sharp the edges of the broken bone is you can determine how long someone lived with the broken bone. So a cracked skull will look different if it was cracked a few weeks before death then if it was cracked around the time of death. In addition when the body is rotting it changes the bone which makes it break differently then if it was in a live body. So if someone died and were burred then later on got uncovered and their skull got cracked it is possible to see how that break is different from how the break would have been if it was around the time of death. Using these techniques it is possible to piece together a rough timeline of the wounds on a skeleton. Of course it is not precise enough to determine the exact cause of death but it can tell if a wound was sustained around the time of death.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
