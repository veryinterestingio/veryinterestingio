<p>All articles I've seen state that the mass of the Higgs and the top quark seem to be on the limit between stability and metastability, although it still hasn't been confirmed. My question is not regarding in which state the universe is but why does this measurements relate to it. Why does it mean than if the masses of these particles was different then the universe will be in another estate of stability/instability/metaestability/non-perturbability?</p>
<p>In short, where do the regions of <a href="https://www.quantumdiaries.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/graphes-m%C3%A9tastable1.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> chart come from and why are they there?</p>
<p>Also, what does the non-perturbability region mean?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The logic goes in the other direction.</p>
<p>The Higgs field has some shape (how the energy depends on the value of the field) that we don't know in advance. We live &quot;in one place&quot; in that field, and we know this place is at least a local minimum, but we don't know if it is the global minimum. If that place is at the lowest possible energy (the global minimum) then it is stable: There is nothing it could decay to. If that place is not at the lowest energy then a transition to a field value with a lower energy could happen. How likely that transition is depends on the &quot;hill&quot; between our local minimum and the region of lower energy. Meta-stability is the region where such a decay is possible but very unlikely to happen within the size and age of the observable universe. So how can we determine the shape?</p>
<p>The Higgs field gives mass to particles. How much it gives to particles depends on the shape of the field, especially for the Higgs boson itself and the top quark. That means, for every possible set of parameters, you can calculate (a) if that is stable and (b) what the Higgs and top mass will be. That's one point in this diagram. Repeat for many possible input parameters and you get the whole plot.</p>
<p>Non-perturbativity is a region where some calculations stop working, but we'll need a theorist for details.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to be an experimental particle physicist (even did a higgs based analysis as part of my PhD) but I've forgotten so much theory now. Can somebody explain what the actual mechanism is for the Higgs dropping to a lower energy if it's not already in the ground state. Where does the energy actually go? Like for an electron in an excited state it would radiate a photon to return to the ground state. What's the equivalent process for this kind of drop in potential?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
