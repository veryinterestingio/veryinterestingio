		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People who think &quot;it's because they're dumb&quot; are wrong.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2814444/" target="_blank">Flies are actually quite capable of learning</a>.  They're not, like, super-bright or anything, but they can remember things.  They can associate food or pain with colors and shapes. If they get in a fight and win or lose, they will remember that particular opponent and behave accordingly. Flies can even learn not to bother trying to mate if their first few attempts go awry, and will avoid courting similar females in the future.  They are certainly capable of learning to avoid a threat.</p>
<p>The reason why they keep coming back is because as far as they are concerned, you <em>aren't</em> a threat in the first place.</p>
<p>Essentially, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/sep/16/time-passes-slowly-flies-study" target="_blank">flies see the world in slow-motion</a>.  You think that the fly barely escaped with its life, but from the fly's perspective, it's more like getting out of the way of an oncoming train - it saw you coming from a mile away.  If there's something that it wants on the train tracks, the occasional train isn't going to discourage it.</p>
<p>In fact, you can tell that the fly remembers you because your first attempt to swat it will usually be closer than subsequent attacks.  The first attack was a surprise; after that it is more alert, knowing that there is a predator in the area.  It just doesn't <em>care</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>Oh no! I’m threatened! Escape it is!</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The nervous system of insects is really tiny and they don’t have a brain in the sense we have.</p>
<p>The solution for how to find food and fly towards it is a combination of smelling (scientists call it olfactory response) and randomness.</p>
<p>In “normal mode” the fly will change direction at random with some average interval between direction changes. But when there is an important smell around, the molecules of the smell will bind to receptors in the fly’s nervous system and make that interval to shorter. The net effect is that the fly will get closer and closer to the source of the smell.</p>
<p>It’s a super simple way to navigate and may seem dum but it is also effective. Mosquitos <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/how-mosquitoes-detect-people" target="_blank">use this technique</a> to target humans and animals that expire carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>The key is that insects don’t make these decisions by choice, their flight patterns are very much controlled by their nerves responding to stimuli (smells) and a whole lot of randomness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you think of it in an evolutionary sense, which is more advantageous, flying away and having to find a new meal, or coming back and risking getting squished? Well, it would depend on how fast the fly is, and the faster it is, the better the chances that a persistent fly would be better off. The thing is, a fast fly is also selected for from the fact that they are prey insects, so they already have high mobility, so the persistent flies win out (are given more opportunities to reproduce, and eventually proliferate through a population.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like others have said, they apparently evolved that way so it must be best for them. Also the vast majority of animals that would swing at a fly are not really trying to kill them, just brush them off. </p>
<p>They also aren't very smart. So they can't exactly learn &quot;oh humans will swing to kill so I better just avoid them&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
