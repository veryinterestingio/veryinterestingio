		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's the thing:</p>
<p>most caves on Earth are formed by the dissolution of calcium carbonate by water (known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karst" target="_blank">karstic activity</a>), and those large amounts of calcium carbonate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/limestone" target="_blank">(limestone)</a> are the result of the biological activity in the past.</p>
<p>So ... most terrestrial caves exist as a direct consequence of large accumulations of fossilized biological materials. Those kinds of rocks have not been identified outside from Earth, we'd go batshit excited if we identified large amounts of carbonates on Mars for instance (we haven't). There are exceptions (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonatite" target="_blank">igneous carbonatites</a>), but these are also exceedingly rare and local.</p>
<p>So, unless there are unknown expanses of carbonates out there, we might be finding caves, but these wont be &quot;like there are on Earth&quot;, or at least most of them.</p>
<p>Or at least, not quite. Cause there are other cave forming processes active on Earth; they are much more marginal, but those ones might be more likely to occur elsewhere in the solar system. Some of these are the result of volcanism, say lava tubes for instance. Others are developed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice\_cave" target="_blank">ice</a> as a result of the flow of meltwater, or the proximity of a heat source (cue more volcanism).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey!  To expand on Gargatua's post, I'm going to link in a table outlining possible methods of extraterrestrial cave formation <a href="https://i.imgur.com/cBsT4kg.jpg" target="_blank">here</a> which is very thorough and I may come back to summarize bits later from that article. Caves are currently known to exist on the Moon and on Mars (both lava tubes, the most obvious candidate for extra-terrestrial caves).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Table and information all from Penny Boston's entry for &quot;Extraterrestrial Karst&quot; in the Encyclopedia of Caves and Karst Science.  I am fairly sure this publication can be found digitally easily, and the entry has a load more detail+references.  PM me if you are having trouble finding it and want to see.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit:  So some of the neat hypothesized mechanisms for caves to form outside of earth in the chart include:</p>
<p>- from ice volcanism on ice covered bodies like Europa</p>
<p>- volatile labyrinths on places with ground ices</p>
<p>- CO2/methane/ammonia ice caves </p>
<p>- fumarole caves with ice over hot volcanism (<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/2018/10/mount-rainier-washington-ice-cave-exploration-danger-discovery/" target="_blank">Mount Rainier has really fascinating ones</a>)</p>
<p>- non-water solvents for karst (N2 on titan?)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Generally, caves form either from melting and re-solidification of material (lava tubes a prominent example), or from cracking and enlargement of crustal material.  The former has obvious mechanisms on other planets (be it with ice or volcanism).  For the latter, this doesn't require plate tectonics, and can come from expansion/contraction, impact cratering, and tidal flexure. Enlargement into caves can happen even without fluids (like in the case of a talus cave) or through freezing expansion of ice.  The possibility of dissolution speleogenesis would definitely be the most interesting (as this produces the longest and most complex caves on Earth), but this would require significant deposits of soluble rock and fluid to actually do the dissolving.  There is a possibility of fossil caves on Mars if say gypsum or carbonates did get deposited and subsequently underwent karstification in a wetter/warmer phase, but evidence of this would be covered by the surface dust on Mars obscuring ready detection of gypsum/carbonates. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
