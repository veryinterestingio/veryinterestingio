		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the country and even within countries there are different types of ownership. It isn't very meaningful to discuss &quot;ownership to the core&quot; since no human endeavor even gets close to getting through the earth's crust.   </p>
<p>In some cases, one would &quot;own&quot; the land and mineral resources underneath it. In other cases, not. </p>
<p>Some countries allow only a time limited &quot;lease&quot; on land - even though they may call it a purchase. Nearly every country has a rule allowing for &quot;eminent domain&quot; which means the government can, at their will, seize land and property (sometimes with compensation).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>So now for the long version. Really, you're only buying the surface. You're not even buying everything ON/UNDER the land unless you're willing to pay extra, and even then there are weird things that you have to consider. </p>
<ul>
<li>Mineral/mining rights - So I don't know if it's an everywhere, or just a parts of the US thing, but, for example, let's say you find gold on your land. Woohoo, right? Not so fast. Do you have the mineral rights? If not, somebody else who DOES have mineral rights can come in and mine the gold and give you nothing for it. Same with oil, etc. So if you find gold, keep quiet about it until you can secure your mineral rights. </li>
<li>Water rights - here's another one, that's ESPECIALLY important in parts of the southwest. Once again, you might not have the right to access water on your land, unless you buy water rights. </li>
</ul>
<p>So when buying the land it's best to determine what rights you need to go with it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We had a place in Tonopah Nv. that had several building lots included in it, the deed stated we owned the surface only.  A mining Co. had the mineral rights.  When we checked into it we learned that if they wanted to the mining Co. could excavate to the surface but they could not cause the house or any ground to collapse.  We also did not own the water rights which was not a problem as it was in town with city water.  As we did not have the water rights we could not implead or impound the water that fell as rain or snow. The water had to be free to run off to whoever held the water rights.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh this is a great question! In English property law, there is a maxim about the extent of interests in land: cuis est solus, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos. This in essence suggests that the extent of interests in land extend indefinitely upwards and to the centre of the Earth downwards. However this is demonstrably untrue, although the actual extent of vertical interests in land is not precisely defined. There are a couple of explanations for this. Pragmatically, it is not sensible to have a system where the property right extends upwards indefinitely. For instance, there would be able to veto eg commercial airliners flying over your property and, if you take the concept to its logical limit, satellites. The better explanation however relates to the nature of property. Property isn’t a ‘thing’, it is actually a power relationship and definitions of ownership are general premised on the right to use, the right to control, the right to exclude (and others - check out Tony Honore’s work if you want the non-ELI5 version) and so on. You cannot meaningfully exercise control over land to an unlimited extent, so the idea of having property to the heavens or centre of the earth is not terribly meaningful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
