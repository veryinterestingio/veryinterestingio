While I understand that 'you have to spend money to make money', the sums are enormous and it isn't like Netflix is a new company. How is it possible for a company to operate like this? Are they expecting to play all that debt back?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You’d be surprised how many companies operate in massive debts.</p>
<p>The methods vary - the simplest is that a debt figure isn’t as simple as it looks.</p>
<p>The first aspect is that having debt doesn’t mean they don’t have actual cash in the bank. In the same way that a mortgage doesn’t mean you don’t have money - all agreed debt has terms.</p>
<p>Say they have 10 invoices for a million each due this week. They have 50m in the bank. So they pay their 10 invoices on the day they’re due. Their debt just dropped by 10m. But if on that same day, another supplier sends them an invoice for 10m that’s due in 60 days, it will look like they’re still in the same debt position.</p>
<p>They’ll still have 10m of debt, but it’s gone from 10m of debt due this week to 10m of debt due in 60 days. And in those 60 days, they’ll be getting in subscription money, as well as interest, etc. So they have time to gather the 10m to pay that invoice. </p>
<p>Whenever they get a new supplier or renew a contract with a supplier, they’ll negotiate payment terms (or try to), in order to get the longest payment terms they can. Because that way they have longer between getting invoices for something and actually having to pay for it.</p>
<p>Beyond that, simple debt isn’t really a great measure of how well a company is doing. A better measure is how much their debt is worth vs what the company has. So basically “if I were to sell everything the company has at it’s expected value, how much of that would be needed to cover my debts?”</p>
<p>In the case of Netflix, they may have huge debts, but taking the value of their cash and everything else in the bank, their debt is only worth about 62% of it. To use easier numbers, let’s say everything netflix has is worth 100m. If we sold everything netflix at expected values and then paid off all debts, there would still be about 38m left. </p>
<p>The last concept would be leverage - basically using what you have to get more. Then simplest real world example I can think of is actually in house buying. (Called leverage because of that “longer lever brings bigger effects”) thing.</p>
<p>Say I have 200k to buy a house with (for this, assume it’s magical Christmas land and 200k can buy a house outright). <strong>edit: I don’t care if house prices where you are are low enough to buy a mansion for 2 grand. So stop replying telling me that you can</strong></p>
<p>I could use my 200k and buy a house. If that house is worth 300k in a year. With no leverage I’ve gained 100k in a year, or 50%. </p>
<p>But say I split my 200k into 4 blocks of 50k, and used those as down payments on 4 houses with mortgages for the other 150k. So I’ve spent 200k and got 800k worth of house. </p>
<p>A year on, each of those 200k houses is worth 300k (ignoring things like interest and repayments for simplicity). My debt is still 600k, but those houses are worth 1.2m now. I sell 2 houses for 300k each and pay off all the debt.</p>
<p>Now I own 600k worth of house and I only spent 200k to get there. So with no leverage, I gained 50% of my initial spend. With leverage I gained 200%. </p>
<p>That’s basically what Netflix does. They spend a ton on making shows like the Witcher, with the expectation that their 200m spend will bring them significantly more than they’d have gotten from that 200k if they did nothing.</p>
<p>So while yes, they operate on debt, they’re actually in a decent position.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every company has debt. I work for a company that is 4 billion in debt but we gross 8billion a year. It’s the same as a human between my mortgage and student loans I’m 1/2 a million in debt but I make 120k a year why don’t I just declare bankruptcy?  Because I make more than enough to cover payments on my debt and generate a net savings. This is the same as a company. As long as they can cover their debts and net a profit they are in the black and doing fine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you borrow money you pay a certain amount in interest each period (month, quarter, semi-annual, whatever).  You may also pay down some of the principal (the money you borrowed).</p>
<p>But if your net earnings exceed that, you have a proffit.</p>
<p>Say I borrow $10 billion and owe $600 million in interest per year.
If I am earning $1 billion, I can use my profits to pay that interest and have money left over.</p>
<p>A company borrows money to invest in a venture that they think will be profitable, taking into account the cost of borrowing.  A company borrows, becomes more profitable, then repeats the process.</p>
<p>This is an alternative to selling stock to raise money for investing in a new venture.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Netflix has $10bn in debt, but $4bn in cash. They reported only $500 million of interest for the year on the debt, which they can easily cover. </p>
<p>Every company has debt and carries debt, why pay cash for something when you don't have to? The full $10bn in debt won't come due all at once so Netflix will either just pay it off in pieces as it becomes due, or they will refinance it and just issue replacement debt at a better rate. I looked at their reporting at there is no singular debt greater than $2bn. The $10bn you see is divided into 12 different debts and won't come due in totality until 2029.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
