		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a whole room (or trailer) full of directors, producers, and editors watching dozens or hundreds of feeds simultaneously. They're pretty much constantly cutting highlight shots, different angles of play, etc to be ready when the lead director wants a replay.</p>
<p>It's a huge amount of very fast-paced work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It’s basically just a multi channel video recorder on steroids with instant access to recorded video w/audio    </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I design control rooms and their replays systems, and its not quite as bad as one might think.  On large shows (if run properly) each replay op will have 4-6 camera inputs to watch, with one or two outputs.  Ops that have been working for a long time get used to the rhythm of the sport theyre working.  Cameras angles are arranged roughly the same way at every venue (partially cuz I do that too, and obviously we have guidelines), so you know the looks you have available.    Like others have mentioned, theres a certain adrenaline rush to having a show go well, and when a production crew is working well together the whole thing feels like a well practiced dance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've only worked on small set-ups/crews but there's usually a replay operator in sports broadcast control rooms. They'll have a rolling recording of a handful of camera angles on a specialized piece of equipment. When the director of the production asks for a replay to show on air, usually of a big event like a goal, they'll ask the replay op to cue up the goal. The replay op will &quot;jog&quot; back to the point in the recording where the goal happened (usually just a few seconds to a minute ago), while the replay machine is still recording the camera angle in real time. The director will &quot;take&quot; the video signal from the replay machine, while telling the replay op to &quot;roll&quot; their footage and put it on air for the viewer at home.</p>
<p>It's a lot less editing, in the traditional sense, and a lot more of switching video signals on the fly. Kind of like putting a puzzle together as 5 different people are throwing pieces at you. </p>
<p>Sometimes you'll see a heavily edited video as the broadcast is going to commercial break, kind of a highlight reel of the last period, inning, etc. I don't have much experience with that but as far as I can tell, that is done with video editing software (Adobe Premiere, etc.) and played directly out of the computer or done with a much more advanced level of replay equipment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
