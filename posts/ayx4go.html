		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is such a fascinating topic! The short answer is, for the most part, yes. To an extent, building these structures seems hard wired into the animals. However, there's evidence that certain aspects of these behaviors may be learned as well. For example, birds of the same species will build the same structure of nest. Additionally, birds raised in captivity with little to no interaction with conspecifics will build nests with the only difference being those nests are of a lower quality than that of birds in the wild. </p>
<p>Spiders and their webs are fascinating case studies on innate behavior. There's been a number of experiments on how chemical substances affect spider web building. Like birds, spiders of the same species will build the same web structure. Not to mention, there's at least one parasitic species of wasp whose larvae hijacks the spider's web building behavior, forcing it to create a cocoon as the larvae feeds on the spider, by &quot;overriding&quot; a couple of the web building instructions -- works kind of like code insertion in programming.  </p>
<p>I don't know much about bees, though I suspect the mechanisms are similar to spiders. There's a lot of interesting aspects of bees that go back to innate behaviors, such as how queens develop, that's worth further reading. </p>
<p>As for humans, a lot is debatable, but I would argue that two such behaviors are nesting and language. All apes exhibit nesting behavior (ie. Build beds), to the extent that non-human apes in captivity will become distressed when not provided with nesting material. Apes in captivity that have never seen nesting performed by other apes will, if provided with material, nest. Language is a more interesting example as we don't quite know how language evolved. There's heavy evidence that prestructures exist in the brain which influence language development (wernicke's and broca's) but the greatest evidence towards language development as an innate behavior in humans is the Nicaraguan deaf-community where a complex sign language spontaneously emerged amongst youngsters who had otherwise minimal exposure to language. </p>
<p>Edit: Just wanted to add that on the surface language may not seem like what you're getting at, since you're describing somewhat tool use related behaviors, however, there's some theories regarding a relationship between language development and tool use.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Thank you everyone for being as interested in this stuff as me! This has to be my most popular comment and it makes me so happy that it's in science. I had wanted to mention too just the interesting dynamic between the original post's example species. Spiders are the only animal on that list which are not considered a social species and will even cannibalize members of their own species. Interesting food for thought on how much of their behavior is innate considering their lifespan is largely spent without another spider to learn from. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bee and Spider constructions are based entirely on instinct.  The animals are born knowing the behavior needed to construct the habitat, and do it properly right from the start. Birds are more complicated: the behavior is instinctive but has learned components. Humans have examples of both kinds of behaviors, but not with regards to building physical constructions.</p>
<p>To go into more detail:  Spider webs are formed in a distinct step of stages.  For example, for orb weavers produce a web in a <a href="https://ednieuw.home.xs4all.nl/Spiders/Info/Construction_of_a_web.html" target="_blank">distinct</a> series of stages that they follow in an almost robotic manner.  Even  more irregular-looking &quot;cobweb&quot; webs are actually constructed according to a regular pattern of behavior. <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/159147481.pdf" target="_blank">link</a>.  The spider follows the set of actions in order and produces a web, there isn't a lot of flexibility to adapt this behavior to changing situations...for example damage to the web may result in the whole thing being torn down and rebuilt rather than a simple repair being made.  </p>
<p>Bee behavior is also instinctive, but beehives are a result of many interacting individuals exhibiting simple behavior.  For example, the hexagonal packing of beehive cells is a result of individual bees attempting to build circular cells as close together as possible, using their body size to determine cell size.  But if you try to make a series of circles packed in as tight as possible and sharing walls, what you get is hexagons.</p>
<p>Bird nests get more interesting because they provide an example of a kind of learning which combines with instinct (note a caveat, there are a lot of birds and they build a lot of kinds of nests and the following isn't exactly the same for all of them).  In short: birds don't need to be taught to build a nest.  When they are in a nesting mood they naturally begin to gather the materials needed for a nest and arrange them into a nestlike form, even if they've never seen a nest before.  But...they aren't necessarily <em>good</em> at it.  Especially with more complex nests, as they build nests again and again they gain practice.  The basic instinct is there but learning helps it develop into full form <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/news/all-news/birds-260911" target="_blank">link</a></p>
<p>Now what about humans?  Humans have a number of purely instinctive behaviors.  A good example is the nursing instinct in infants.  Plop an infant on skin and it will instinctively begin moving its head around in a side to side motion called &quot;rooting&quot;.  If it finds a projection it will grab on and start sucking.  This sequence of behavioral steps is not, in principle, all that different from the more complex series of steps that causes a spider to build a spider web.  In general these kinds of instinctive behaviors are called &quot;Fixed Action Patterns&quot; and generally are responding to some stimulus, and have actions that always happen the same way and in the same order.  </p>
<p>Bird nest construction, on the other hand, is more like human instincts such as walking. A human is born with the underlying instincts needed to learn to walk; if you dangle an infant over the ground it will move its legs in a walking pattern.  And there's a behavioral drive to reach the end goal (moving around successfully and upright).  But the intermediate steps (if you will) have to be learned.  The instinctive leg-moving motion has to be refined into a balanced and precise series of motions, and this happens through learning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
