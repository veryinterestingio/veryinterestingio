		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the US, there are no laws at the federal or state level. Most cities do not have laws except that the city planning department can deny a request.</p>
<p>So, generally, whoever builds the road can name it.  Whether it is named with street, road,  avenue, court, or whatever, is based on whichever sounds best to the person doing the naming. </p>
<p>Also, in response to another comment, most dead end streets and courts are not designed that way. The city plans usually list them as streets that have not been completed or are temporarily blocked.  The legal requirements for creating them is very cumbersome, so they normally make plans to make them a normal road at some point in the future but never actually do.</p>
<p>Source - I was a developer and planning commissioner.  I created several subdivisions and helped write a city's general plan.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In general there are no rules, except for large cities, that often have avenues in one direction and streets in the other, and alleys that are dead ends or one way without parking. Each road needs a name for the fire department and postal service. Private roads can be named whatever you want, provided the local government okay's it. [Welcome to crank street off of puddle lane!] There are many historical naming conventions, that cities tend to follow, but there really isn't much holding them to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

For example kings Lynn..

<p>It appears though that just about any variation can apply to any roadway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Transport Planning terms the difference between a  'Road' and a 'Street' largely signifies how we think of the main purpose of the place. </p>
<p>A Road is something we pass along - it signifies a route where the main purpose of the road is.aa a highway for  movement. A street is somewhere we also spend time where the movement function is a secondary function - or at least that there are clearly two main uses. </p>
<p>In the UK we talk about 'High Streets' as the main Street in a town with retail and other place functions. In the US this is 'Main Street'  But the principal extends to local streets where traffic flow isn't the first though of what is the most important thing going on.</p>
<p>This definition is layered ontop of a lot of semantic and debatable historic points and different perspectives. It's most definitely not a black and white difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
