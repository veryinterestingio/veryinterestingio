		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other explanations here are not really getting at the heart of your question (which isn't any different for gravity - other forces do the same thing).</p>
<p>Your error is in going &quot;this is a solid object and nothing can go through it&quot;. But what you think of as &quot;solid objects&quot; are not completely impenetrable. As an everyday example, light has absolutely no trouble going through glass.</p>
<p>[EDITED to clarify: this part is here to explain to OP how their idea of 'solid' is inaccurate. It's not directly about how forces can go through things] <del>'Solid' objects don't fill up all the space in the region they occupy (in fact, they're not even <em>close</em> to filling up all the available space). They seem solid on human scales because electrons repel one another, so once two atoms get even somewhat close, they're pushed apart by the repulsion of the electrons in each atom.</del></p>
<p>On an even more fundamental level, fields (like the electromagnetic field or, if you set aside some of the weirder aspects of relativity for a sec, the gravitational field) aren't different things from the physical objects around you. Objects are &quot;made of&quot; these fields, in the same way that a wave in the ocean is made of water. What we think of as a particle is just a place where these fields take on different values from other parts of the field, in the same way that a wave is just a place where the water is a little bit higher. And so your question becomes, roughly, &quot;how can water travel through a wave?&quot;.</p>
<p>If this seems strange, well, it is. There's a reason it took fifty years and some very surprising experiments for the most brilliant minds in physics to figure it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A good analogy for gravity is putting a bowling ball on the center of a trampoline<br />
<a href="https://blakedynasty.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a6ef4079970b0120a7f14ec2970b-pi" target="_blank">https://blakedynasty.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a6ef4079970b0120a7f14ec2970b-pi</a>  </p>
<p>the bowling ball sinks into the 'sheet' and any other balls you put on will roll towards it.<br />
No matter where you put other balls - near to the bowling or farther away - they'll always roll towards the bowling ball.  </p>
<p>and also if you have lots of balls inbetween the bowling ball and the edge of the trampoline, they all still roll towards the bowling ball at the center.  </p>
<p>so - with the huge sun at the center of our solar system, all the planets are affected by it no matter whats in between.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What we perceive as the Force of Gravity is actually a warping of Space-Time produced by the presence of &quot;<em>Things</em>&quot;. &quot;Things&quot; in this context are Matter, Energy, and <em>maybe</em> some other things we don't know about yet. If it <strong>occupies</strong> Space-Time, then it warps Space-Time.</p>
<p>Space-Time is the Space and Time that <em>Things</em> can occupy in this universe. When Space-Time is warped by the presence of <em>Things</em>, a <em>bias</em> is introduced into how <em>Things</em> move through that warped Space-Time. Objects will move towards the <em>Thing</em> that is warping Space-Time, unless they have reason <em>not to</em>. You experience this as Gravity.</p>
<hr />
<p>The warping of Space-Time has some funky properties. </p>
<p>The Warping is at its most intense where the Thing is, and falls off relatively quickly... but never ceases to have an effect. This is the reason we have Ocean Tides on Earth. There are three sources of Gravity that are strong enough <em>on Earth</em> to affect the oceans: Earth, our Moon, and The Sun. When the Moon or the Sun is overhead, the gravitational bias changes enough that the oceans are &quot;stirred up&quot; by the small change in their weight.</p>
<p>The Warping produced by multiple <em>Things</em> located in the same place will &quot;combine&quot; to produce an aggregate effect larger than any one <em>thing</em> could manage. That's why celestial bodies have Gravity Wells. The weight of any one grain of sand isn't much, but the weight of the entire Earth and everything on it creates a Gravity Well that holds the whole thing together (and forces it to a roughly spherical shape).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Weird Side Note: Gravity goes <em>weird</em> at the center of a Celestial Body. It you stand at the Center of Mass for a Planet... you'd probably experience something similar to Zero Gravity if it weren't for the intense pressure of everything <em>else</em> being pulled towards you.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>With that groundwork in place, we can answer your question.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If something is inbetween two objects how do the particles know there is something bigger behind the object it needs to attract to?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the weirdest thing about Gravity to wrap your head around. Every other Fundamental Force has what are known as &quot;carrier particles&quot; that move information around. Gravity, as far as we can tell, <em>does not have a Carrier Particle</em>.</p>
<p>Gravity-Related Information is not directly shared between Particles... it is instead indirectly shared through the aforementioned warping of Space-Time. The particles don't need to communicate, because the information is stored in the medium (Space-Time) they occupy.</p>
<p>The only way to affect the strength of a Gravitational Field is to either shove more <em>Things</em> into a space, intensifying the aggregate warping effect of that mass; or you need to take <em>Things</em> out of a space... spreading that effect out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It bends space and time. To block gravity, you’d need to bend space the other way. To do so would require an absolutely incredible scientific discovery, and is the basis for the hypothetical warp drive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
