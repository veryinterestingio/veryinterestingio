		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The coroner is the person in charge of reporting to a court the circumstances in which someone has met an unexplained death. A medical examiner is someone who examines people who have been killed or injured during the course of a crime or suspicious incident. A forensic pathologist is someone who examines a dead body and determines the cause of death. </p>
<p>There is a great deal of overlap between these roles and often they can be performed by the same person, indeed a forensic pathologist is a specialist medical examiner. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the United States, the Coroner is someone who investigates deaths which are sudden/unexpected without an attending physician, and deaths which are violent or suspicious. The Coroner is called to investigate when someone dies in a car accident. He's also called upon when someone is admitted to the hospital and dies unexpectedly within the first 24 hours. From there, they can decide whether an inquiry as to the manner of death is undertaken.</p>
<p>Coroners qualifications to serve vary by state as well. Some are lay people without any medical background (as is the case with ours--he owned a gas station/auto repair shop before being <em>elected</em> Coroner). Other states require that the Coroner be a Medical Examiner (a physician), and other states require that the Coroner not only be a physician, but one who specializes in Forensic Pathology as well. </p>
<p>TL;DR: The Coroner is a broad term for one who investigates suspicious or sudden deaths. States vary in their requirements to become a Coroner--some are lay people, some are physicians, and some are Forensic Pathologists (MD's who specialize). </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In many states, coroners do not have to be doctors. However, both medical examiners and forensic pathologists must be doctors. A forensic pathologist is a doctor who has become board-certified in the field of forensic pathology. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
