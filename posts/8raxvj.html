		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The blocking of your nose is essentially caused by tissue swelling and blocking the airway. This swelling isn't static and can be influenced by outside factors, such as temperature, humidity or posture (vertical vs. horizontal). That's a general explanation for why your airways block or unblock depending on what you do. </p>
<p>My airways usually unblock immediately when I go outside in winter due to the lower temperature, which reduces the swelling. Similarly, my airways block when I lie down (horizontal position), but unblock when I get up (vertical position). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its called postural blood pressure. We usually assume a clogged nose feels that way due to mucus but its more often caused by swollen blood vessels narrowing your airways. When you stand, your bp lowers, in turn shrinking the swelling and opening up the airways. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because when you sit up, your blood pressure increaes (relative to a lying down posture) and causes your sinuses to open up. In general higher activity you are performing, higher is the heat generated by your body and this promotes opening up the nose. That's why some people here mention that when they jack off their nose opens up, as it's just another excersise. </p>
<p>Higher BP can also result from raising your arms above your head when you are lying down. Try it, it helps with sleeping when your nose is blocked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different positions have different impacts on blood circulation in your head and in your nose. Standing has less blood rushing to your nose, sitting has more, lying down is the 'worse' in that regard (hence why trying to to go to sleep with a stuffy nose is awful, when standing up isn't that bad). As for eating food, my guess would be that it's a mechanism designed to keep you breathing with your nose when your mouth is occupied, to prevent choking. Just like holding your breathe for a while will decongest your nose (try it next time!). Your brain is not stupid, it will not block your nose to fight an infection or small allergy if it's not worth it, i.e risking death.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
