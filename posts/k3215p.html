So, when you shower or bathe for long periods or go swimming your skin is dried out. Why does a lot of water dry something out? Shouldn’t it do the opposite?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a special protective layer of emulsified sebum (skin's natural oils) and water on everyone's skin, called the acid mantle. The acid mantle prevents trans-epidermal water loss and keeps the skin moist and at a pH of about 4-5, but when that layer is compromised it causes the skin to lose it's water content and become dehydrated. Water's natural pH is around 7 (neutral), so long term exposure to water causes an alkaline reaction with the acid mantle and throws the balance off. This is also why especially after taking very hot showers or baths, or even washing your hands constantly, can cause your skin to feel very dry. When soaking in water, and the acid mantle becomes compromised, your skin essentially endures osmosis with the surrounding environment!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, difference of concentration between your body and the water. Usually the water has a higher concentration in &quot;salts&quot; (ions and cations) than your body. So, in a long exposure to water, your body will release H2O to the environment you're immersed, and your skin you become dehydrated. </p>
<p>If you bath yourself in saline, Which has a concentration of 0.9%, I believe your skin wikl not wrinkle from dehydration.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
