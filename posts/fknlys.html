		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The honest answer is we don't actually know. What you are describing is called a 'side stitch', which you can google and find a lot of information about. A lot of information but no explanation for what causes it and no universal solution to stopping it. My experience has been that as you get in better shape, your side stitch will become wholly less prominent. Sometimes, when I get one while running, the solution is to actually run much harder and faster. I suppose it is like breaking your finger when you have a gunshot wound, you introduce a different pain so your mind ignores the other pain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you run (especially at a speed that is “hard” for you), your body starts diverting energy away from non essential functions to power your muscles and breathing. It’s a primal “flight” mode. One of the non essential things is digestion. So that ham sandwich you ate stops being moved along the digestive track and becomes a heavy weight in your stomach/small intestines causing discomfort. </p>
<p>The same thing will happen in your large intestines, but since there is a readily available exit...</p>
<p>Also, this is why runner use energy gels. They are readily absorbed without the need for mechanical digestion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During med school someone asked this and the answer was: When you jog or run or do some aerobic exercise, if you don’t have a proper breathing technique, and breathe through your mouth you will eventually swallow enough air to bloat out your stomach and distend the nerve ganglia around your intestines to make it hurt. That’s why some people feel pain on either side of your abdomen.</p>
<p>Sorry for grammar and what not. English not first language yatayatayata etc.</p>
<p>Hope it helps</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
