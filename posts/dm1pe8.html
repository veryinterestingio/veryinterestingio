		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is not fully understood by science but much research points towards some form of serotonin deficiency, in either its production or turnover in our bodies. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that we synthesise from the tryptophan we eat in our food and helps us regulate mood. Whilst poor diet can clearly contribute it is also clear that certain experienced events can also disturb our brain chemistry. Generally speaking that emptiness will also coincide with a lower level of serotonin or an ineffectiveness of the serotonin receptors in our brain to process it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain is like a room full of fun floating balloons that you love and they always keep you happy. The happy balloons only float for a certain amount of time and then they go all flat, fall back to the ground, and then get filled up with fun air again and float back to the top! The happiness cycle starts again! There are always full balloons in the room so you’re always able to feel happiness!</p>
<p>When you’re depressed, what happens is, the floor of your room unfortunately breaks and falls away and there’s just a big, black hole in the ground. Your fun, happy balloons deflate like normal but instead of sitting on the ground to inflate again, they fall into the dark hole and get lost. It can take ages for you to rebuild the floor so you might not be happy for a long time, but rest assured that with hard work you can get the bricks back down and get some balloons back in there so the cycle of inflating and deflating can return again like normal! </p>
<p>The balloons in this case are actually a happy chemical called serotonin; your brain sometimes forgets how to keep serotonin inside itself properly like the room in the story above, so people feel a kind of sadness. Some tablets you take can help you keep the serotonin in your brain and stop it from vanishing into the black hole, which helps you regain happiness and rebuild that floor so your brain can keep the serotonin around by itself!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have lived with depression for over 30 years. Some days are fine, some days (weeks, months) are unbearable. This answer comes from my personal experience. </p>
<p>Imagine you have a person following you around. Everything you try to do, they tell you it's dumb and you're an idiot for doing it. Every nice thing someone says, your follower cuts them off and tells them they're wrong.</p>
<p>With depression, that person lives in your head. </p>
<p>So imagine now the things you enjoy. Pizza? It's gonna make you fat. Sex? She doesn't want you. Games? What an effing loser -- what are you even accomplishing? </p>
<p>How do you find joy in those things with your own brain shitting on them constantly. That's why they feel empty. That's why you feel empty.</p>
<p>HTH.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you are in so much pain, your mind creates a space between yourself and the pain so you can't feel the pain. That's the void you are experiencing. The problem is that it doesn't just create space between you and the pain, but all other senses like pleasurable senses as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
