This apparently regenerated lung cells and modulated the immune response to keep it from overreacting to the COVID-19 infection and causing further damage to healthy cells.</p>
<p>It worked successfully on all the 73 patients without any side-effects.</p>
<p>So how did this process exactly worked? And why are stem cells so imp in generating specific healthy cells?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answers here have good explanations of the meaning and function of pluripotent stem cells, which are backed up by robust scientific evidence.</p>
<p>However, in the commercial world, there are lots of “stem cell clinics” that offer treatments that involve extracting “stem cells” from a patient’s body - usually adipose tissue - and using them to create a treatment to be applied somewhere else in the body. In reality, most of the time these “stem cells” are actually mesenchymal stromal cell mixtures which are only thought to contain some stem cells, and not even the pluripotent kind.</p>
<p>There is very little scientific evidence around the efficacy of these treatments and people should be wary of any therapies which claim to be using stem cells.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So as a quick qualifier, I don't know anything about the study you are referencing in your question. However, I can address what a stem cell is and why it is important.</p>
<p>Everything and everybody starts out as a single cell (the fusion of a sperm and egg in the cast of humans). As the embryo develops those cells divide and become more specialized. At first, some cells decide they are going to be the top half of the body and others become the bottom half. This keeps going and cells keep specializing, they start to form different organs and tissues getting more and more specialized.</p>
<p>As cells become more specialized they reorganize their genome, packaging it up so that the cell and any cells it divides into know their job. This is pretty useful for a developing body, after all, you don't want a muscle cell to decide it wants to be a skin cell. In fact, when this does go wrong it can result in diseases like cancer.</p>
<p>This process of specialization is pretty hard to reverse, we call cells that can become anything and are not specialized at all as totipotent. Then cells get a little more specialized and we call them pluripotent, then multipotent, and then differentiated. Let's say that someone has damage to the cells in their lung and the body wont grow new ones. We can't just use a cell from somewhere else in the body to become a cell in the lung, it has specialized and won't do its new job.</p>
<p>In this case we want to use a cell that has not yet specialized so that we can convince it to do a new job. This unspecialized cell is the stem cell, and we can get it by trying to find unspecialized cells in a body or use signalling molecules in a test tube to try and convince a differentiated cell to revert to its undifferentiated state. Now we have cells that have the potential to do all sorts of important jobs throughout the body, and medical researchers can apply them to solve difficult problems. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a biochemist who works with human pluripotent stem cells. I would be very skeptical of that report. You just can't make cells into a mist and expect them to survive. And simply injecting stem cells into someone is not sufficient for regeneration (in fact, this carries a lot of risks).</p>
<p>Do you have a link to the study? If so I can evaluate it further.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the love of god could we have the source? Lung cells are not immune cells. How could something regenerate lung cells while modulating immunity? Let’s think, please. </p>
<p>But to your point, stem cells <em>can</em> be effective because they can be prompted to become a specific cell required for a specific therapy. Like the blank scrabble piece that can be used more freely than a given letter. </p>
<p>Bear in mind cells are just spaces defined by membranes, so the extent to which you can <em>make</em> a specific cell to change the site of its destination is not necessarily greater than the extent to which the destination changes the cell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
