		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with stretching or not stretching certain muscle groups.  If you have chronic sinusitis, it might have to do with draining a nostril by sleeping on one side or another.  If you're asthmatic, it might be more comfortable to sleep face down or on a side with most of your body facing down.  Basically, whatever makes your body feel most comfortable and relaxed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It usually takes me 1-2hrs to fall asleep, and if I have to change positions every few minutes until I eventually fall asleep on my back.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In part, it has to do with the fact that a twisted position is a position in which there is the least amount of tension between muscle pairs (e.g. biceps and triceps). It's obvious with small muscle pairs, for example your fingers always curl when relaxed, but it's not so obvious with large muscle pairs and the reason is that with small pairs tendon tension overcomes the force of gravity and forces of friction even in a relaxed state, which doesn't happen with large pairs except for some specific situations. For example, you can observe it while being underwater where the force of gravity is negated by buoyancy, and you can also see it when watching astronauts on the International Space Station which is in a perpetual freefall.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's also because of the warmth you feel when you curl up or hug a pillow. It does get cold during the night. Also, I've noticed that I tend to sleep straight and not curled up if the weather is hotter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
