Standing, stagnant water allways looks so disgusting.  Was the ones who lived immune systems so much better or were they able to keep the cistern free of diseases using plants or something?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve worked at a historical farm with a cistern. It is based on a farm in about the 1680’s. Edit- it is Pennsbury Manor outside of Philadelphia on the Delaware. Since the actual manse had been torn down it is a reconstruction based on historical records, though some of the window panes and artifacts are authentic. Including a large silver plated dish that was used for years as a sled by a nearby family!</p>
<p>They generally didn’t drink the water straight. </p>
<p>Either it was boiled (tea or hot chocolate, coffee wasn’t a huge thing in this area at the time) or stored in a generally antimicrobial state (beer/wine.) The farm I worked at had a brewery on site and made different levels of beer (small beer for example was made for consumption by children, slaves, and workers as an everyday beverage as it had about 1% abv, it was made from the last possible brew from the mash, usually the third) for the people there. Anything fermented was then considered safe to store. That wasn’t always true, as sanitizing wasn’t understood as well as it now, but it was much better than drinking water that people literally pooped in while on ships in the nearby river.</p>
<p>Cistern water was generally used without adulteration to water plants and feed animals. It usually was not used casually for human consumption since there was a known risk of disease and while they didn’t fully understand why, they knew drinking water directly from the source would be detrimental. </p>
<p>Again, this is from a specific place and time (William Penn’s reconstructed estate outside of Philadelphia) so I can’t speak to every cistern.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I have to block the drain holes on the roof during a hurricane to avoid getting my too much salt in the tank. Then the water tastes bleh. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ancient people did not understand how disease worked on a theoretical level, but they observed just fine and knew that stagnant water would go bad, while constantly flowing water tended to remain safe. Water systems were built around this.</p>
<p>I'm going to stick to Roman here because that's my field. They built aqueducts to direct a constant flow of pressurized water into any city of a large enough size that local well/river sources couldn't supply the people's needs. We think of the spectacular arched ones, but most aqueducts were just channels underground and pipes. All were covered and filtered to keep out filth as much as possible.</p>
<p>When the water arrived at the city, it would be diverted. Much of it flowed directly to fountains, the primary water source for the population. Wealthier homes also had indoor plumbing, and all of this was gravity pressurized. They also had cisterns to take the excess water.</p>
<p>The cisterns weren't simply filled up and allowed to sit there. The water was continuously refreshed by the aqueduct's inflow, so it did not stay stagnant. It was not as safe as freshly delivered water, though, and people knew this, so it wasn't used as drinking water except in an emergency. Cistern water could be used for irrigation, diverted to baths, or simply dumped into the sewers. Places like Rome had tons of water coming in, way more than they needed, so there was no particular pressure to conserve.</p>
<p>If your city was under siege and the aqueducts were cut? Then you had to drink the cistern water. It did make some people sick, but not drinking at all would certainly kill you, so. You make the choice.</p>
<p>Ancient people also understood that boiling water would render it much safer, so that was often done. Especially if you were drinking water that was not nice and clean, like out of a cistern.</p>
<p>The idea that people just drank alcohol and that made it safe is... I'm not going to say 100% mythical, but like 95%. The concentration of alcohol required to sterilize a drink requires distillation, which they did not have. Neither beer nor wine is sterile from its alcohol content, and they weren't drinking it to excess. Roman wine was always diluted with water (unless you were a total barbarian) to prevent getting too drunk, and the Romans didn't really drink much beer, at least not in Italy. Up in Gaul they would have. People drank small beer because it tasted good and the low alcohol content meant you didn't get sloshed.</p>
<p>Look up something like the Gin Craze in Britain for a time where people were actually getting hammered constantly. The ancient/medieval world wasn't like that, despite the persistence of that myth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No answers have yet mentioned the most important factor: a properly designed cistern actually keeps water very clean, and knowledge of the proper ways to do it goes back thousands of years. Biofilms in the tank sequester contaminants and heavy metals. There’s been quite a bit of recent research on this, although I keep losing track of the citations, check out the work of Brad Lancaster.</p>
<p>The most important aspects are that the biofilm is not disturbed, that the input source is clean, and that the tank has good water flow through the central water column.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Norway we have a tradition of dropping a copper-coin into the container, and letting it sit overnight.</p>
<p>Don't know how far back this goes.</p>
<p>Besides - Norway is a rainy place, and rivers are everywhere, and is not the best example, but thought I'd chip in.</p>
<p>Other than this, most water-containers of old are made from copper, and are still utilized by most cabin-owners.</p>
<p>When in doubt, we boil - and likely have for a very long time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
