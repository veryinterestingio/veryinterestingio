Swine flu makes sense, because farmers would be commonly exposed and a rare mutation would allow it to jump, but how can a rabid animal spread to humans so easily?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also, are their other diseases that readily jump to vastly different species?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have to remember that humans are just big mammals. If a virus binds to a fairly ubiquitous receptor then we more than likely can be infected. Influenza is a great example because hemagglutinin binds to sialic acid-containing molecules and those types of receptors are everywhere, so much so that influenza evolved neuraminidase to release the sialic acid bond if it doesn't produce an infection.</p>
<p>Rabies is thought to bind some fairly ubiquitous receptors at the neuromuscular junction. I'll let the veterinary folks get into the non-mammalian physiology but I think only mammals possess these receptors so rabies has nothing to bind to in say a reptile. Though it could simply be that most mammals have a sweet spot body temp for rabies. Humans at 98.6F can easily get rabies but possums at 94F-97F almost have no incidence of rabies.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because rabies is a neurological disease that affects mammals. It is most likely that rabies developed based on the mammalian neuron which is largely unchanged between mammals. Which receptor it attaches to exactly is not sure but it is most likely the receptor for the neuro-transmitter acetylcholine, though it is not limited to cells with this receptor suggesting multiple receptor pathways are employed by the virus.</p>
<p>It is a simple single strand RNA virus with it's own polymerase. Meaning that all it needs to replicate is access to a cell. It can then just replicate it's RNA by plucking nucleotides out of the cytoplasm and replicate itself as much as it wants.</p>
<p>Rabies can cross over so many species is cause it didn't develop based on species specific receptors, such as for example salmonella typhoid which in other Great Apes doesn't give them fevers at all only in humans. Rather the rabies virus targeted something far more fundamental. Neurological receptors that have been essentially copy-pasted across all mammals. Just to give you an example of this structure, all mammals have frontal lobes. All non-mammals do not.</p>
<p>Another example of species specific diseases is Malaria. There are specific parasites that cause malaria that ONLY survive in Chimpanzees and not in humans. Because they exploit a receptor that humans lost during the evolutionary split from the common ancestor of human and chimpanzee. But way back when a human got a bit to close to a chimpanzee a mutated strand crossed over. And that's how human malaria was created which now exploits a receptor exclusively found in humans. Humans can't get chimp malaria, chimps can't get human malaria. But they are essentially the same parasite only exploiting entirely different receptors for successful proliferation in the host body.</p>
<p>Look up zoonosis. The medical term for transmission between humans and animals. You'll find hundreds of diseases there though they might not match your definition of &quot;readily&quot; or &quot;vastly different species&quot; whilst to me any disease that can make the leap between even two species is already quite a readily spread disease between vastly different species.</p>
<p>Short version: Rabies is a disease that doesn't target a species of animal. Rather it targets an entire Class of animals called Mammals.</p>
<p><em>EDIT: Correction rabies does not contain it's own ribosome. I mixed up ribosome with polymerase when I wrote this from memory. Ribosomes create protein chains from amino acids. Polymerase transcribes DNA/RNA for protein synthesis and can make more DNA/RNA using nucleotides.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Viruses jump from one host species to another all the time, though it can sometimes take decades or centuries for them to become entrenched in the new host.  The technical term for it is zoonosis.  AIDS, Ebola, SARS, the various influenza strains, Marburg, trichinosis, anthrax, rabies, and a host of others are some examples.  I highly recommend <a href="http://www.davidquammen.com/spillover" target="_blank">this book</a> to learn more on the topic (and also scare the living shit out of you).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I found a paper published in Neglected Tropical Diseases^(1)   that suggests that birds are susceptible to rabies infection in areas where rabies is highly endemic, the following is the paragraph with the primary findings from the paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The carcass of a domestic fowl (Gallus domesticus), which had been bitten by a stray dog one month back, was brought to the rabies diagnostic laboratory. A necropsy was performed and the brain tissue obtained was subjected to laboratory tests for rabies. The brain tissue was positive for rabies viral antigens by fluorescent antibody test (FAT) confirming a diagnosis of rabies. Phylogenetic analysis based on nucleoprotein gene sequencing revealed that the rabies virus strain from the domestic fowl belonged to a distinct and relatively rare Indian subcontinent lineage </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later in the article it references at least three other articles examining avian serum for rabies antibodies.  It looks like they have some conflicting results.  </p>
<p>Another article^(2) I found with the primary author as the guy who has literally written books on rabies diagnostic methods also mentions that birds are susceptible to <em>Lyssavirus</em> infections. So maybe it's more of a fact than is commonly known since it doesn't seem to at this moment pose that great of a public health risk (even though it very easily could).</p>
<p>I currently work in a public health laboratory that does daily diagnostic testing on animal brain tissues for rabies virus. This entire debate is something I am definitely going to look into more. I;m going to have to talk to someone with more veterinary knowledge as I am not familiar enough with the neurobiology of birds as compared to mammals to know if they have similar receptors or not in terms of viral infection.</p>
