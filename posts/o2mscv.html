		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You could potentially get many answers to this question! One example is if the pathogen's surface proteins recognizing specific cellular receptors that exist on one species but not the other. If they cannot recognize and attach to the cell, they are not infectious. Another variation is the immunity of the species and whether it can keep the pathogen in check. For example, bats have sophisticated anti-viral mechanisms that keep them safe from otherwise deadly viruses (like SARS!).</p>
<p>Yet another variation is the part of the world the host lives in; many pathogens thrive in a specific environment, so it makes sense that they would adapt to recognize hosts that live in a similar environment.</p>
<p>The short answer to your question is evolution. The host and pathogen co-evolve together which reinforces their relationship. Occasionally, however, the pathogen can mutate and cross species, like what happened with SIV and HIV.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Locks vary, some more than others, keys were natrually selected to fit those particular locks. </p>
<p>Sometimes the key is just a notch away from fitting your lock instead of someone else's, that key can natrually change (mutation) and ta da! Now it fits your lock!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine it like key to key hole principal, viruses/ bacteria are the key and the cell is the keyhole. You need the right key to infect an cell. The cells from a human, better say the proteins of the cell of a human are different than let's say the ones of a raven. </p>
<p>The diseases that can spread between a population of ravens are specialised on the protein receptors of the ravens, they are evolved to infect and therefore reproduce in ravens. </p>
<p>But jumps from animal to human are possible if:</p>
<ul>
<li>a lot of different animals are stacked in tight places, the diseas is able to jump from species easier. But that's still a unlikely for bacteria since they are not as fast evolving and most importantly they're DNA is not as volatile in terms of misprinting RNA. So it's mostly viruses that are able to infect different species but that's not to say that bacteria are only specialised in one species that is false</li>
<li>if the animal a close relative to the human best example is a monkey. That's how HIV came to be, it was originally a monkey disease but people ate their meat and since monkey, especially ape DNA is up to 98% comparable to ours, the jump was therefore easy</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simplest answer I can give is &quot;chemistry&quot;.  Different species of animals have different chemical biologies.  As such, the different animals have different building blocks.  At the cellular level, everything is mechanical.</p>
<p>For a virus, a virus requires a 2nd species to proliferate.  In order for the 2nd species to proliferate the virus, the virus's construction has to be compatible with the 2nd species's cells and the 2nd species's diet.  If the 2nd species does not produce the necessary chains to reconstruct the virus, the infected cell effectively ignores it, and the viral code dies when the cell dies.  If the virus is compatible, it can overtake the DNA code of the cell and repurpose the cell for whatever the rogue viral code will consequentially do.  </p>
<p>For bacteria, these critters don't need a 2nd species to proliferate, just food it can digest to keep it functioning.  The bacteria eats substances and releases waste products.  If the compounds that pass around the host species are toxic to the bacteria, the bacteria will die.  If the bacteria create waste products that is toxic to the host species, the host species will either react to it or suffer from the growing toxicity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically it's beneficial for bacteria to survive as a species if they help or barely harm the host, like a cold or gut bacteria or even herpes strains. These bacteria learn to inhabit specific species without killing their literal home. The problem is that a bacteria that knows how to live perfectly inside a bird, don't know how to live inside a human and as a result will usually just die, but sometimes the strain is able to thrive to a harmful degree and give the human the flu or worse. It's kinda like sticking a millennial inside a car with a manual transmission, they'll either stall it a bunch or they'll crash it into a wall because their home is an automatic. This phenomenon where bacteria jump species is what caused nearly every pandemic in history.</p>
<p>P.s. I said bacteria a lot when I generally meant viruses. As another redditor said, viruses are what cause most pandemics and common sickness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
