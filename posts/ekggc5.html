		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: you can’t actually sense temperature; not in the way we usually think of it.</p>
<p>Instead, you sense the transfer of heat into or out of your skin. If different parts of your body are different temperatures, they will feel the same temperature differently.</p>
<p>There are a couple of experiments you can run to illustrate this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Get three bowls of water, big enough to stick your hands into. Fill one with icy-cold water, one with hot water, and one with luke-warm water. Put one hand in the cold water and one in the hot water, and hold them there for a minute or so. Then put both hands in the medium water at the same time, and notice how each hand reports the temperature of that water differently.</p>
</li>
<li>Leave a block of wood, a piece of metal, and a plastic object in a room for a while, so they end up being the same temperature. When you feel them, they will feel different temperatures, because the different materials transfer heat more or less efficiently.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you feel is not the temperature itself, but how fast heat is transferred in (hot) to your body or out (cold) of your body.</p>
<p>Look around you and find some wood (or a book) or glass (table top of drinking glass), or maybe something metallic. Since they're in the room, all 3 of those are at &quot;room temperature&quot;, but if you put your hand on them, they will feel different &quot;temperatures&quot;. Metal will seem colder because it's able to remove head faster from your hand (heat conducts faster in metals, so as the heat leaves your hand, goes into the metal, and conducts away, to make room for more heat to leave your hand, so you feel colder).  Wood will probably feel the &quot;warmest&quot; since it doesn't remove heat from your hand that fast (insulator).</p>
<p>The same happens on different parts of your body. The skin has different layers and depending on which part of the body you look at, it'll have different size of the fat layer which acts as an insulator of sorts. The more fat there is, the longer it'll take the neurons to feel like heat is leaving the body. Head/Forehead has less fat, so if the hot water is hitting it, heat will go in and the neurons will know right away and tell you it's hot. The same water hitting the body might dissipate some of the heat into the fat layer before hitting the neurons.</p>
<p>There's also the whole notion about wet-bulb temperature which is what you actually feel and can be colder than the actual temperature. (for example, you're in a pool, at a certain temperature, and leave, and immediately start shivering even though room temperature isn't that cold. You're feeling the wet-bulb temperature.)</p>
<p>This might be more than a ELI&quot;5&quot;, but i can try to answer more questions in further comments!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On top of what other people have mentioned the water will get cooler as it drops through the air to the floor. If you sit down in a shower the water will feel cooler than when stood up. I would think that as your head is the nearest to the water source it feels hotter as by the time it's reached your body is has cooled slightly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’d imagine it’s because those body parts are different temperatures to begin with, no?
