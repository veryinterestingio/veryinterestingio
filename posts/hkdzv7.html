<p>Apparently the TV company selects a sample of (consensual) families who get a special device that is able to record their activity and info about them and to send it to the company.</p>
<p>They all register and when they turn on the TV they select their profile, so that there’s also information about who’s watching what. In the end, they get paid</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As already stated in other comments, there are measurement boxes (called people meters) or booklets.</p>
<p>Alternatively, maybe more common nowadays, smart TV's and your box receiving and transcoding signals from satellites are connected to the Internet, so it can report stats. </p>
<p>Also, the content might be delivered directly through the Internet on-demand in a case of IPTV and OTT. &quot;On-demand&quot; means that when you choose channel (IPTV) or a movie (e.g. Netflix), a request is sent to the provider and they send you back the content. Just like on Youtube. So providers have very precise statistics about what content flows through the network out of their servers. They know what do you watch, how long do you watch, if you switch the channel during ads and so on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many replies talking about the old systems, where a sample of random viewers would have devices that report back to the company... But the 1990s are over, and now that isn't really true.</p>
<p>In reality, in many cases today your cable box is straight up telling the cable company what you're watching, at all times, so long as the tv is on.</p>
<p>The consequences of this are pretty wild. For example, a decade ago a friend of mine was interning at Google. She was working on the &quot;TV ads&quot; team. Google had bought up the ads to an entire cable company in <state> in return for the data of what people were watching. Based on the data, targeted ads were shown. If you and your neighbor watched the same channel, you got different ads. Or at least that was the plan. </p>
<p>That was ten years ago. Can't imagine how complex it is now.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Already answered for modern times, but back before smart TV's and tracking boxes, the 4 main TV channels in the UK would have staggered advert times. viewership would be estimated by the surge in demand for power when everyone got up to boil the kettle to make a cup of tea.</p>
<p>I don't know if similar methods were used elsewhere, but it makes me proud to be British realising our tea drinking is so predictable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
