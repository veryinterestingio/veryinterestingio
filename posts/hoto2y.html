		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Besides the material part that other folks are already talking about, the traditional method of building a wood framed house accounts for there being moisture in the framing that needs to dissipate over time. I build in a high humidity climate, and we only put a vapor barrier on the inside of exterior walls and roofs, while we put house wrap or tarpaper on the outsides. These materials (house wrap and tarpaper) allow water vapor to pass through, while keeping liquid water out. There is also a certain amount of airflow expected in the framing. Between those two elements, any excess moisture in the framing material is allowed to leave through the exterior wrap. This includes moisture present at the time of construction, and any moisture that manages to find its way in over the lifetime over the building.</p>
<p>On a side note, with the focus that people have on energy efficiency nowadays, it is actually causing an issue with wood framed buildings. If they get built so tight that there is no airflow in the walls, there is no way for any moisture to dissipate. There have been a handful of remodels I have done in the last few years where the walls were full of mold, because they weren't allowed to breathe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modern framing lumber is typically kiln dried SPF #1&amp;#2. The important part to your question is the 'kiln dried' part. This means after the lumber was milled, it went into a kiln to have the moisture content reduced. The moisture being removed is typically sap not water. From this point on, the lumber will more easily absorb and expell moisture. From the kiln on that lumber will likely be outside in the elements until it gets framed into a house. Once out of the kiln it will get tarped. Most lumber tarps are not water proof so the lumber will get wet every time it rains. From there they sit in the mills yard until sold to a distributor. It is usually shipped by rail on a lumber car, which has no roof. From there it will sit in the distributors yard until it goes to a retail lumber yard. Shipped usually by transport truck at this point, also not covered. Retail lumber yards (big box stores excluded) typically store their lumber outside. From there the lumber is sorted into framing loads and re banded for delivery to a house being framed. There is typically no tarp on these loads at all. And from there it gets framed into a house, where it will get over a month to dry out before insulation, poly, drywall go up and seal the wall cavity. The month invetween is typically for Electrical HVAC and Plumbing installation. </p>
<p>There are also 'engineered' wood products out there that have a type of sealer which will keep them from absorbing moisture for a controled amount of time. These typically get used when the GC knows the structure will be exposed to the elements.</p>
<p>Edit: I've had some great conversations with you guys! I would like to add that there are regional differences in wood type and handeling and this is not a 100% global blanket statement. I am from Ontario Canada, and this applies to pretty much every wood framed building here.</p>
<p>Also the 1 month sitting time is variable depending on the size of the build and the timeline of the contractor. Some allow drying time some do not. I didnt really want dive into best building practices. My post is long enough.</p>
<p>Thank you for the gold and other awards, and to the people calling me Ron Swanson. That man is my hero!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The lumber used in framing houses is kiln dried so the moisture is around 19% +/-. It would have to basically be submerged for a length of time to absorb enough water to be a problem . Between the time the house is framed and the roof is on and the siding is on it has time to dry out any moisture while they back frame, do electrical and plumbing etc. I framed houses in BC for many years and it rained ALL the time. We built with wet lumber all the time and found it dries out by the time insulation and drywall arrive.</p>
<p>Edited moisture content, thank you rwoodman.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Construction workers don’t like framing in the rain :). But that’s more to do with being wet.</p>
<p>There are magic numbers with softwood:  19% and 28%.  Wood is made up of bundles of straw like cells.  Fibre on the outside, hollow on the inside to let water (sap) move through the tree.  </p>
<p>At 28%, the cell walls are saturated and the hollow space is full. Floating fungal spores that like cellulose can land and start growing.  Nomnomnom.  And yes, wood that does dry out and stays wet for a long time In warm (above 5c ish) conditions will absolutely Rot.  </p>
<p>Below 19%, the cells are empty and the walls are mostly dry.  Fungus just doesn’t have enough water to grow.  Sorry mould, you are out of luck.   </p>
<p>Between 19 &amp; 28, depending on the species, some will go to sleep until more water shows up.  Others, if they are established, can scavenge enough water to keep growing.</p>
<p>So, yes, you can build with wet wood.  BUT it needs to dry out and stay dry.  Most North American codes require wood to be 19% or dryer before the walls can be closed in (insulation, vapour barrier, drywall in whatever flavour or combination is used in a particular region).</p>
<p>That being said, I (building scientist) have had some arguments about when wood is dry enough.  Some locations on a building might not be “breathable” at all.  Wet wood will never dry out, and rot can start within a year.  Other locations are more breathable and even if wood is damp, I know it will probably still dry out and won’t be an issue.</p>
<p>Source: building science technologist that paid her student loans by diagnosing and fixing rotten buildings in BC Canada.  Wood is awesome.  Wood in a temperate rain forest is fungus food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
