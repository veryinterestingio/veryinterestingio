	<title>ELI5: Why is it that after I buy a new game on Steam, Origin, etc., wait the hour+ for it to download and install, then finally open it to play and the first thing I’m greeted with is an update download? Why isn’t all this a part of what I just downloaded/installed?</title>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the game but general   </p>
<p>1) When a game downloads from Steam (or any other service) it usually comes with some redistributable libraries that need to be installed once.  Those can have security or stability patches that get installed separately.<br />
2) Multiplayer competitive games will often have 3rd party anti-cheat software that is a totally separate installation and often has its own frequently updated pipeline.<br />
3) Additional content... if a company is pushing out a decent amount of content for a game but not changing anything in the &quot;code&quot; there isn't a huge reason to push those changes to Steam/Epic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Liability and logistical issues. When a developer uploads a new game to Steam, it actually takes a fair bit of work on both ends to do quality control, content approval, indexing, technical troubleshooting, etc. Going through the same process to upload a revised version of the game every time there's a minor update would drain resources from both Steam and the developers, AND it would confuse the issue of who is responsible for addressing customer problems. Under such a system, if you buy and download a game and then it's not the version you wanted or isn't what you expected, who is responsible? Steam or the developer?</p>
<p>By comparison, the current system has the developer upload one version of the game to Steam which includes an updater as part of the original package. It does add a step when you, the customer, buy and download and then have to update the game, BUT you know exactly who to go to if there is a problem and it's easier for Steam and the developer to do business together.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I have been corrected on the particulars of this description with regards to Steam. See replies below.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like you're playing a game (And following a publisher) that isn't actually using the Steam platform.. but rather.. they have their own launcher and manage updates on THAT, while only sending periodic 'base' updates to the Steam platform, so it's always behind during the first install.</p>
<p>Using Steam purely to cover ground rather than their actual update distributor.</p>
<p>Many (MANY) people will have no idea what you're talking about because most Steam games publish directly to Steam, every update, every patch, etc. No shitty launcher-in-the-middle topology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
