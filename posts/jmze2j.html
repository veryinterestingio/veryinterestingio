		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The clues we have to the shape of the Milky Way are:</p>
<p>1) When you look toward the Galactic Center with your eye, you see a long, thin strip. This suggests a disk seen edge-on, rather than a ellipsoid or another shape. We can also detect the bulge at the center. Since we see spiral galaxies which are disks with central bulges, this is a bit of a tipoff.</p>
<p>2) When we measure velocities of stars and gas in our galaxy, we see an overall rotational motion that differs from random motions. This is another characteristic of a spiral galaxy.</p>
<p>3) The gas fraction, color, and dust content of our Galaxy are like other spiral galaxies.</p>
<p>So, overall, it's a pretty convincing argument. Of course, we have to assume our galaxy is not completely unlike the other galaxies we see—once a civilization has accepted that it does not occupy any special place in the Universe, arguments about similarity seem sensible.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Partial answer: We can see a lot of it. We don’t encompass the whole thing (or even a fraction of a fraction) We’re on one of the arms so we can just look towards the core, and every other directions and piece together a pretty good idea just from what we can see.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One technique is surveying the sky for 21cm radiation from hydrogen (± some shift of frequency for red/blue shift) and doing some math to determine where that means that hydrogen would be concentrated in a rotating disc. That 21cm wavelength isn't blocked by dust as much as visible light, so it's possible to receive it from much farther away.</p>
<p>Map that rotating hydrogen on a disc based on its shift and you're looking at approximately the distribution of matter in the galaxy. Maybe... if I understand correctly and didn't lose too much in simplifying the concept.</p>
<p>Here's much more detailed info by someone who studied it much better than I did:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding on to what others have said: We can't directly image our galaxy (at least not from outside of it, and not the whole thing at once)... but we have direct images of millions of other galaxies that we can use to find patterns and see what kinds of shapes galaxies generally take, and then compare that to what we can see from within our galaxy to make guesses as to what sort of shape ours probably looks like.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
