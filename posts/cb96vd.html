		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So this is a bit out of my study area, but given that (at least of the time I'm commenting) none of the other commenters have provided any sources for anything, so I'll try to weigh in. </p>
<p>Let's start with some basics. We generally know that a lot of carbon is potentially stored in permafrost <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/F_Stuart_Chapin_Iii/publication/252146189_Permafrost_and_the_Global_Carbon_Budget/links/53d97cb70cf2a19eee87e225/Permafrost-and-the-Global-Carbon-Budget.pdf" target="_blank">e.g. Zimov et al, 2006</a> or estimates from <a href="http://openknowledge.nau.edu/487/7/Hugelius_G_etal_2014_Estimated_stocks_of_circumpolar_permafrost_carbon%282%29.pdf" target="_blank">Hugelius et al, 2014</a> so it's not a big logical jump to start considering the potential for a feedback where warming causes a thaw of permafrost, which leads to a release of carbon (either as methane or carbon dioxide or both), which drives more warming, etc. Massive releases of carbon from permafrost (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane_clathrate" target="_blank">methane clathrates</a>) have been invoked to explain extreme warming episodes in the geologic record, e.g. this example from 'deep time' from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06961" target="_blank">Kennedy et al, 2008</a>. </p>
<p>In terms of how, generally, the process of permafrost thawing might impact our current anthropogenically driven global warming experiment, things are decidedly less clear. A very cursory search of the literature reveals a general theme in papers, specifically, a reiteration of the ideas above (i.e. this general process has the potential to be a very potent positive feedback in driving warming) but then followed by a discussion of all the uncertainties in how this would actually play out. For example both <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2010RG000326" target="_blank">O'Connor et al, 2010</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14338" target="_blank">Schuur et al, 2015</a> both emphasize the uncertainties, with O'Connor providing a bit more detail, specifically (from the abstract) 'The amount of carbon stored in permafrost, the rate at which it will thaw, and the ratio of methane to carbon dioxide emissions upon decomposition form the main uncertainties'. The actual process of release is also complicated as it's not just a 'it thaws and gas escapes' sort of thing, it's typically a biologically mediated (or at least modulated) process and our understanding of how this works is still evolving, e.g. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13798" target="_blank">McCalley et al, 2014</a> (<a href="http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:765226/FULLTEXT01" target="_blank">postprint</a> of McCalley paper if you hit a paywall) and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0095-z" target="_blank">Knoblauch et al 2018</a>. The Knoblauch paper emphasizes an important aspect of this, specifically that even though there is a lot methane stored in permafrost, some (potentially large) fraction of it will be converted to CO2 by bacteria, with the CO2 then being emitted, with their main point be that you actually get as much greenhouse gas being emitted from thawing permafrost in oxygen poor water (anoxic) as you do in oxygen rich water (oxic).</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> - a quick survey of the available literature highlight that this is an important question, there are reasons to think it could be really significant, but there are really large uncertainties that preclude a direct answer to your question, because we don't (1) know exactly how much carbon (and in exactly what form) is stored in permafrost, (2) how fast it's thawing, (3) how to directly equate its thawing to greenhouse gas emissions, or (4) what form those emissions will take (i.e. CO2 vs CH4), which is also pretty important in assessing its potential for generating warming and over what time period given the different residence times of CO2 vs CH4.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>“About half of the world's total underground carbon is stored in the soils of these frigid, northern latitudes. That is more than twice the amount of carbon currently found in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, but until now most of it has been locked up in the very cold soil.”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak to <em>how much</em> methane will be released. However, I do like to share this tidbit on the impacts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The runaway greenhouse effect is used in astronomical circles to refer to a greenhouse effect that is so extreme that oceans boil away and render a planet uninhabitable, an irreversible climate state that happened on Venus. The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report states that &quot;a 'runaway greenhouse effect'—analogous to Venus—appears to have virtually no chance of being induced by anthropogenic activities.&quot;[19] Venus-like conditions on the Earth require a large long-term forcing that is unlikely to occur until the sun brightens by a few tens of percents, which will take a few billion years</p>

Luck for us methane has a half life of 7 years in the atmosphere so its total green house effect will not be on biblical scale but can still be quite large in the short term of a few decades.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If we aggressively seed these areas with fast growing forests, would the new forests offset some of the new carbon emissions (over a longer timespan of course)?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
