		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Square-Cube law is a bitch.</p>
<p>If you take a human, and increase them in volume so that length width and height are all 2x bigger, they will be 8 times the volume, but the area of their footprint will only be 4 times as big. The surface area of an object scales squared, while the volume scales by its cube. </p>
<p>This means that the weight per square inch of foot will increase significantly.</p>
<p>There are other similar reasons why things don't just scale up, but most come back to square cube law in some form.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, like others said there is the square-cube law, but that's not the only reason.</p>
<p>- Small humanoid robots are not easy to build. They are expensive and usually great at only a limited amount of things. For example, most of boston dynamics robots are good at moving on legs. They have great equilibrium, can move in different terrain, etc. But they can't relly lift much than small object, they have limited dexterity, etc. </p>
<p>- Almost if not all humanoid robots are just demonstrator, test, prototype. They exist to improve our know how and show to public/investor for companies to get more investment. Upscaling them to make mecha is just upscaling cost, with little demonstration that it would bring them more money.</p>
<p>- Mecha are not a good idea. People like them because they are cool looking and that's why we see them in fictional stories, but in real life even if they would be cheaper, barely anybody would pay for them. They are simply almost always a better machine to do the job.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The big problem is what is often called the &quot;square-cubed-law&quot;. It's called that because some properties of an object increase with the area (square), whereas others increase with its volume (cubed).</p>
<p>In other words: If you make something twice as big, it's less than twice as strong. For example, ants are strong enough to lift objects that look ridiculously large in relation to their body size, even though they have tiny legs. But if you scale an ant up to the size of an elephant, its legs would just collapse under its own weight - which is why elephants have legs like tree trunks.</p>
<p>For engineering, this means that making things bigger is often difficult. A hobbyist can make a scale model of a passenger airliner using nothing but styrofoam, whereas Boeing has to use strong materials like aluminum and carbon composite for the real thing. And likewise, a boston dynamics robot scaled up into a mecha sized war robot would probably crumble under its own weight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a mistake to think we have &quot;no problem&quot; building those kinds of robots.  Boston Dynamics makes cool stuff, but they have been at it a while and there is a reason we are don't see their robots running around everywhere.  They have a very limited battery life, and right now, they are so expensive you are better off with a traditional robot or even just hiring a guy to follow you around and do stuff.</p>
<p>Even if we had the technology for mecha (we don't) they question would be, the question would be, what is a more effective military option, one mecha or six fighter jets and twenty tanks?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
