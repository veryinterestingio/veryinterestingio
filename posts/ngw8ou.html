		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They didnâ€™t. Oil is principally formed from microorganisms like algae and plankton falling to the bottom of the ocean over hundreds of millions of years. </p>
<p>Coal is formed from vast forests of tree like plants that grew in swampy areas for millions of years before there were microorganisms that could break down their woody structure and cause decay. Over time layer on layer built up.</p>
<p>In both cases these layers would be buried by sediment and heat and pressure took over the process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fossil fuel is not primary made of dinosaurs. Fossil is from Latin fossilis that mean &quot;obtain by digging&quot; so they have the same name because both are found in the ground not because the creation was related.</p>
<p>Coal is was formed from trees  in low-laying wetland, something similar to peat moss but with trees. 90% of the coal is from the Carboniferous and Permian periods, both are before the emergence of dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Petroleum (Oil) was primary formed in the age of the dinosaurs but from  zooplankton and algae in large shallow seas. The oxygen level in the was very low on the bottom or sediments cover stuff there faster then they could decompose.</p>
<p>Dinosaurs lived on land. There was large sea reptiles back then but they are not dinosaurs. Because relative few dinosaurs would float out and settle on the sea bed very little oil is mad of dinosaurs.</p>
<p>So the condition where you get dinosaur fossilization is not the same as where petroleum was formed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a common misconception that fossil fuels are derived from animals. For the most part it comes from plants, algae, microbial organisms. When the organic material becomes buried under sediment, over time the heat and pressure increase and the organic materials break down into simpler forms, a kind of hydrocarbon soup we call crude oil, natural gas etc. </p>
<p>Depending on the environment it can also turn into peat instead of petroleum. Peat could eventually form coals and tarry petroleum like substances if given enough time, heat , and pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dinosaurs don't get converted into fossil fuel, trees get converted into coal and algae get converted into oil. 66 million years ago or earlier dinosaurs died and were eventually covered up and left mostly fossilised bones, some in tar pits left more remains, but not much more. Some animals from much more recent past like mammoths were encased in ice and remain fairly well preserved, but mammoths are not dinosaurs.  <a href="https://youtu.be/d5hV08h4aGA" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/d5hV08h4aGA</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
