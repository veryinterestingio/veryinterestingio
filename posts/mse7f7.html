		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Estrogen is inherently procoagulable. This is unavoidable in the same way that if you are sprayed with water you will get wet. If you inject high dose estrogen into a man who is bleeding, it can help stop bleeding (and cause blood clots).</p>
<p>Any systemic estrogen will have a risk of causing blood clots that is related to the dose taken, and any other risk factors the person has for clotting (ex: smoking, older age, etc). </p>
<p>We get around the risk of clots from estrogen containing oral contraceptives by using progesterone-only OCP when appropriate, and by not using estrogen based methods in patients who have an elevated risk of clotting due to their other risk factors. </p>
<p>You need to consider however that blood clots are a relatively common medical problem in the grand scheme of things, with an average <em>annual</em> risk of 1/1000 per year in all-comers (though this will be lower in those &lt;40). Thus, the additional ~5/10,000 <em>total</em> risk of getting a blood clot while on estrogen OCPs does not lead to that large of an absolute change in your risk.</p>
<p>This is like how eating preserved meat regularly increases your risk of cancer. However, if you are reading this, you already have a ~40% risk of getting cancer in your life, and eating preserved meat regularly will increase that to 40.0001%.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there are a few nuances here that are being glossed over. When we talk about birth control pills we are talking about estrogen/+/-progesterone/progestins taken orally. There is no question there is an increased blood clot risk with this form and route of hormone therapy, though still mild in otherwise low risk individuals considering their total lifetime risk.</p>
<p>Estrogen can also be used as replacement for premature ovarian failure or for severe postmenopausal symptoms. The risk of blood clots and venous thromboembolism is significantly decreased when estrogen is taken in a transdermal or vaginal route.</p>
<p>So yes, we can diminish blood clot risk in birth control pills by using progestins only, but to say all forms and routes of estrogen equally increase blood clot risk is not true.</p>
<p>EDIT: Wording for accuracy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What a fortunzte timing for asking this question.</p>
<p>The other answers are right as to the why.
However, I'd like to add that the FDA just yesterday announced that it approved a new type of combined oral contraceptive which is based on the combination of estetrol rather than the regular estrogens used so far. Estetrol (e4) is an estrogen made by the body in pregnancy, and the company putting it on the market claims that it would not cause the clotting risk.</p>
<p>However, they did NOT in the course of getting their marketing approval (which took them something like 10 years, prove that.</p>
<p>Why? Well, that's where economics of the thing come in: the clotting risk is something that ls a relatively rare thing. Something on the order of raising a risk that 1 in 10k women develop over their lifetime if no pill is taken to 7 in 10k over their lifetime with the safest pills.</p>
<p>In order to statistically prove any effect, you'd need to study tens of thousands of women over years, at a cost of hundreds of millions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the existing oral contraceptives have existed for so long and have been genericised for so long that competition has brought prices and profit margins down to next to nothing (cost to the end payer of ten-ish dollars a month). That means that there is no way no how (I'd think) a new entrant can start asking the hundred(s) of dollars a month needed to recoup his R&amp;D investment if he proved the lower risk up front.</p>
<p>So, the company decided not to prove it up front, and is banking on making a premium pricing work on the basis of convincing prescribers of the underlying (theoretical) science that it &quot;should&quot; have a reduced rate of clots. They are hoping that enough people will switch so they can study the results in the market and then see the statistical evidence of reduced clotting rate emerge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
