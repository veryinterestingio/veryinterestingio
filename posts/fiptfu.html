		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dry coughs lack mucus and are the result of tissue inflammation. Basically your lungs are swelling, but not producing much mucus (also called sputum when it's from the lungs). Other types of infections tend to trigger your nose or lungs to make a lot of mucus, which will come out when you cough or sneeze.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dry means that you're only pushing &quot;dry&quot; air out of your lungs and through your throat. That makes for a distinct sound, and hurts your throat because of the lack of fluids and the fast moving air. When there's phlegm hanging around in your throat, it gets pushed up by the air when you cough, making a different noise. It also means your throat gets hurt less fton coughing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was recently prescribed a secondary high blood pressure medicine, Lisinopril, which is one of the ACE inhibitors and started having a dry hacking cough, especially at night, that was so bad I couldn’t sleep so I went to urgent care and then to my doctor and was prescribed cough medicines then an RX for GERD but none of those stopped my coughing. I realized that when OTC Delsym nor RX Tussionex cough syrups didn’t work that it had to be something else. I looked up dry hacking cough on Google and saw where 20% of people who take ACE inhibitors get a dry hacking cough so I mentioned it to my doctor and he apologized for not catching it. This was after about a month of coughing every night and sometimes coughing fits during the day. My doctor gave me a different type of blood pressure medicine and I noticed my coughing started up again so I stopped taking that RX and coughed for about another 3 weeks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
