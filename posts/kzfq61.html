They often have a dedicated sensor for red,  green, and blue, and prisms to separate the colors. All of this and more takes up space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TV news photographer here. For the most part, they’re not necessary but very useful. I use a pair of dslrs for pretty much everything except going live. The advantage of using a big broadcast camera (most commonly a Sony PMW XD320, 350, or 450) is that you have every i/o you could ever need without having to tack on any accessories, and you have a built-in multichannel audio mixer with two xlr inputs. </p>
<p>Another reason is, I said I use a pair of dslrs. The sensors in broadcast cameras are much much smaller than even a crop-frame dslr or mirrorless. That means you can use a single  lens with a much smaller form factor to get coverage approximate to what would be 28-300mm on a full-frame sensor, and the Fujinon glass typically has a constant f1.9</p>
<p>I have to use one camera with a 16-35 and one with a 70-200. A single zoom lens that could provide a similar range of focal lengths as the broadcast lens on a bigger sensor would either be massive, or would sacrifice on aperture size at the long end.</p>
<p>The image quality, especially dynamic range is pretty poor on those cameras, which is one of the main reasons I don’t like them very much.</p>
<p>Basically they’re big because they have everything you could ever need from a news camera built in, whereas with a small camera, you’d have to tack on a whole bunch of accessories to get the same functions</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well a large part of those cameras now is the optics. The lenses are designed to be able to cover a whole lot of range without needing to be swapped out, and since all that is still physical it's kinda hard to minitaturise.</p>
<p>The lens needs be to be where you have your hand, and the balance point needs to be on your shoulder so there is  minimum amount of weight the camera needs to have to properly balance those optics. </p>
<p>Having some weight, and having it spread out a bit also helps stabilise the camera when moving around. </p>
<p>Working with that as a base it's then more about  packing as many features in as possible in a reasonable amount of weight as space. You get things like really good external audio, processing power to do real time encoding into a number of different formants, lots of drive space for high quality video, and if you still have space and weight left over, no one is going to complain about using it for battery capacity.</p>
<p>That being said this type of camera is seeing less and less use. If you see a new camera this size it's likely to be way more camera than is needed for most situations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends what they are filming. Bright daylight with a staged intreview? Probably can get acceptable footage on a high end cell phone. A traffic incident at night? Your cell phone won't come close to producing broadcast quality footage but a professional video camera will.</p>
<p>A big thing professional cameras have over your consumer grade devices is larger or more sensors. At the base level, larger sensor sizes = more light captured = better quality footage.</p>
<p>Being able to capture as much light as possible is VERY important when filming in non-perfect conditions.</p>
<p>Also larger cameras mean they form fit better quality lenses as well (better quality lenses that let in more light are also bigger).</p>
<p>You can see a sensor chart for some professional video cameras here: <a href="https://www.provideocoalition.com/2019-camera-comparison-chart-year-end-update/" target="_blank">https://www.provideocoalition.com/2019-camera-comparison-chart-year-end-update/</a></p>
<p>Here is a sensor chart for professional DSLR / Mirrorless / consumer grade cameras: <a href="https://capturetheatlas.com/camera-sensor-size/" target="_blank">https://capturetheatlas.com/camera-sensor-size/</a></p>
<p>If you use a cell phone to record video your sensor area may be 27 sq mm. A professional full frame DSLR? 864 sq mm. A professional news camera? 935 sq mm per sensor (these cameras usually will use 3 sensors so you are looking at 3.5x total sensor size compared to a professional full frame DSLR.).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
