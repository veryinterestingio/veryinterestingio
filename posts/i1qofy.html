<p>So essentially the end product our immune system sees is similar, it’s just how the vaccine creates that product that’s different.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I could be wrong about some stuff, but my general understanding is that the real difference between the vaccines is that they have different delivery methods. I believe both ultimately target the same protein, that being the spike protein (the thing on the coronavirus surface that enables it to enter your cells). In fact, both the oxford/azn vaccine and the moderna vaccine trick your body into producing that spike protein, which results in an immune response against it. The difference is in how they do it. The oxford vaccine is an adenovirus-vectored vaccine, where adenovirus particles carry the DNA that encodes for parts of the pathogen of interest (in this case, the spike protein). These adenovirus particles are able to enter the cell via endocytosis, where they then release that genetic material. The DNA is subsequently transported to the cell nucleus and finally translated DNA&gt;RNA&gt;protein. The moderna vaccine (and also Pfizer's I think) skip the viral vector step and directly introduce the mRNA encoding for the spike protein into your cells via some other delivery method (which I dont know about but sounds hard since mRNA is readily degraded outside cells). This has the potential to remove complications from immune response to the viral vector as well as enable faster development, but is a really new technology even compared to adenovirus vector vaccines and is less tested to be safe. So in short, both vaccines intend to protect against the same thing, but the delivery strategy is different and one may be more effective than the other (we don't know yet).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Oxford and Moderna vaccines do the same thing two different ways. Moderna’s does not target the mRNA, it is mRNA. Both make host cells produce spike protein in situ.</p>
<p>Moderna’s vaccine consists of an mRNA encoding the viral spike protein suspended in a lipid nanoparticle (effectively a droplet of oil). Cells absorb the LNP and the mRNA is released into the cytoplasm. The cells’ ribosomes translate the mRNA, produce spike protein, and the presentation of protein to the immune system invokes an immune response to produce antibodies against the spike protein.</p>
<p>The Oxford vaccine instead uses an ademo-associated virus from chimps to deliver a plasmid (small circular chromosome) designed to express the same spike protein.</p>
<p>I haven’t seen the actual sequence of either, but I’m of the impression that they both carry the complete transcript — so they present exactly the same protein product. From that perspective, the only difference between the two (if any) is the amount of protein produced and for how long (this isn’t described in those terms in the reports from their early studies). There’s not going to be much of an additive effect as you’re merely increasing the dose of the active ingredient either way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>See the other comment, but you had a good thought. Some newer vaccines for some of the toughest viruses do just what you suggest, include both recombinant protein and RNA or DNA. I personally worked on one like that for African Swine Fever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
