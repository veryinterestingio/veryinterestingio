		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! Suspension engineer here!</p>
<p>A few here have said suspension and they are correct, however I'd like to add on to their answers. There are several areas of elastic deformation which get compressed and suddenly spring back upon stopping. This is where this motion comes from, so I'll touch on the easy ones, then the lesser known ones.</p>
<p>The first and most obvious thing is normal suspension compression. The center of gravity (COG) of a vehicle is the theoretical point at which the car could be suspended from a rope, and be perfectly balanced in any orientation. Very generally speaking, in most passenger cars, this is about where the gear selector lever is located on the center console. When you press the brake pedal, the front tires are effectively dragging (but still rotating) over the pavement. You can think of this as a rearward force acting on the tire precisely where the tire contacts the road. (We call this the contact-patch)</p>
<p>Putting this all together, when a vehicle is slowing down there is a forward force at the vertically higher COG, and a rearward force at the tire contact patch which is on the ground. This difference in vertical height causes the vehicle to pitch forward, compressing the front suspension. The energy of deceleration is imparted into the front springs and shock absorbers.</p>
<p>The second area that experiences elastic deformation is the tire. Engineers hate tires. I hate tires. People have spent lots of time worrying about the correct and best suspension geometry for the tire. But, at the end of the day, you're car rides on four floppy rubber bags with air in them. Even in the best test environments they can be somewhat unpredictable. When you brake (Not &quot;break&quot;!!!, sorry. Pet peeve) the tire squishes around and acts like a spring. This moves the contact patch backwards with respect to the axle centerline. Upon braking, more stopping energy is pushed into the springy rubber tire.</p>
<p>Seeing a trend, here?</p>
<p>The third, and most fun thing, are the suspension bushings. A bushing is a flexible connection that allows for things to move and pivot more easily. In this case, your vehicles suspension is full of springy, rubber bushings. Much like the tire above, these bushings compress when you are stopping, turning, accelerating, or just going over bumps. </p>
<p>There's one extra bushing that actually permits this action more than others called compliance bushings. Typically, the compliance bushings are located on the front axle assemblies, on the lower suspension arm. It's usually bigger than the others and farther forward or backward of the front axle centerline. The reason for this is because of wheel vibration. Wheels can vibrate due to many reasons, but usually it's because the rims and tires are not perfectly balanced. This is why you get new tires &quot;mounted and balanced&quot;. When your front wheels are out of balance and vibrate, you get a wiggle in the car or steering. That sensation is the front wheels vibrating up and down AND front to back. The up and down vibration is usually handled by the spring and shock absorber, but what about the front to back vibration? Compliance bushing saves the day! It dampens (sometimes hydraulically) the vibration of the front tires in the longitudinal direction. They make your car vibrate less, with the drawback of being a springy thing in the front suspension. Slowing down in the car puts further energy into all of your springy bushings.</p>
<p>To summarize, nothing in the world is perfectly rigid, and engineers spend a lot of time concerned with this fact. When you brake in your car, many non-rigid rubbery-springy-things absorb energy as they compress, then suddenly unload that energy just as you stop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is one of the occasions where you experience jerk (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerk_%28physics%29?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerk_%28physics%29?wprov=sfla1</a>). It is the time derivative of acceleration, as acceleration is the time derivative of speed.</p>
<p>It's a bit difficult to explain without some graphs, but I will try anyway:
If the car deaccelerates with a constant breaking force, the acceleration has a constant negative value. When coming to a standstill, the acceleration jumps to zero. This means a big, almost instant change of acceleration, which is also a very big value in the jerk. This has the effect that the car bounces back and forth a bit. </p>
<p>You can prevent this by either releasing the break right when the car stopps or by driving immediately backwards after stopping (not really possible in a normal car, but often done in mechanical applications to prevent oscillation)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how acceleration is the derivative of velocity and is the rate of change of velocity?</p>
<p>Well jerk is the derivative of acceleration and is the rate of change of acceleration.</p>
<p>When you brake at a constant rate, your rate of acceleration might be -10 mph per second. So if you started at 30 mph, you will feel a constant deceleration right until you hit 0mph. At that point you feel that -10mph per second deceleration jerk to 0 mph per second.</p>
<p>You can counter that by easing off the brakes the slower you get, that way you spread the jerk out and have a small change in your rate of acceleration over time instead of a sudden change in your rate of acceleration right at the end.</p>
<p>edit: another thing to think about is if you didn't actually stop at 0mph and started going backward.. you would never feel that lurch since your acceleration wouldn't stop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
