<p>Tl;dr It has been found that some mosquitos favor certain combinations of bacteria in our skin and our body. Scientists do not know what combinations are favored. This also does not remain constant until after puberty, so where you grow up and the bacteria you were exposed to when you were younger could play a role. It is also noted that body odor genetics could possibly be related to this and be involved as well.</p>
<p>They also mention at the end that future research into this could lead to identifying the attractive bacteria to mosquitos and modifying them as a permanent repellant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>Not surprisingly—since, after all, mosquitoes bite us to harvest proteins from our blood—research shows that they find certain blood types more appetizing than others. One study found that in a controlled setting, mosquitoes landed on people with Type O blood nearly twice as often as those with Type A. People with Type B blood fell somewhere in the middle of this itchy spectrum. Additionally, based on other genes, about 85 percent of people secrete a chemical signal through their skin that indicates which blood type they have, while 15 percent do not, and mosquitoes are also more attracted to secretors than nonsecretors regardless of which type they are.</em></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Genetic makeup seems to play a key role in mosquito-attraction. Getting a report from a genetic health assessment (e.g.: 23 and me) seems to be able to somewhat-predict your chances of being bitten by the bothersome bugs. Blood type also plays a role, as does your microbial-makeup (mentioned previously in the comments). Not mentioned, as far as I can perceive, is diet (garlic tends to repel, and bananas tend to attract).</p>
<p>As to microbial makeup, we actually have more microbes in our makeup than we do our own cells (<a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-human-microbiome-project-defines-normal-bacterial-makeup-body" target="_blank">https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-human-microbiome-project-defines-normal-bacterial-makeup-body</a>); in fact, current predictions are that we have <strong>ten times</strong> the number of microbes than we do our own cells!</p>
<p>When it comes down to it though, I very much believe that the chance of being bitten by mosquitoes (and other blood-sucking bugs) is the combination of a melange of factors, including genetics, blood type, personal micro-biome, and diet. For example, 23 and me predicts that I have an average chance of being bitten, but I know from personal experience that I have an above-average chance. My blood-type is O-, and my diet is pretty average, for an American (though I had been Keto for quite a number of years in the past). The fact that I am bitten more than average points to another factor, and I am guessing that factor is my personal micro-biome.</p>
<p>Edit: after further review, someone did mention diet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
