		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your bones are surrounded with blood veins that can transport the nutrients necessary to repair your bones if they break relatively quickly. Your teeth lack this surrounding vein structure, so to repair holes on the surface they would need to transport the necessary nutrients through bone. Since bone is too rigid to do this at any perceptible pace, the acid damage from the bacteria will outpace any repair that does happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bones are made up, in part, of living tissue. Only living tissue can be regenerated in our body (generically speaking) and, while there is some living tissue in the teeth (the pulp, or center, has blood vessels running through it) the majority of a tooth is non-living. While bones and teeth both contain calcium phosphate, teeth are not actually bone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a dentist, let me try to explain - the cells that form bones (osteoblasts) remain functional throughout your life. Hence, they can form bone whenever needed. In reality - your bone is not stable, it is constantly being dissolved and formed simultaneously by bone dissolving (osteoclasts) and the bone forming (osteoblasts) cells respectively.</p>
<p>About teeth - it consist of 3 layers - outer white enamel, middle yellow dentin and inner pulp. Enamel and dentin are calcified (like bone, but much harder) and enclose the pulp that is a soft tissue containing blood vessels and nerves. When you have a cavity, the bacteria first dissolve enamel, then dentin, finally reaching and infecting the pulp, causing pain. The cells that form enamel (ameloblasts) die after their enamel formation activity has completed (ie - after the tooth has erupted) so enamel cannot be formed again in any case. As for dentin - the cells that form dentin (odontoblasts) remain living, but occupy the inner spaces towards the pulp (they somewhat form an outer lining of the pulp) and only form dentin again when the pulp is in danger/is getting irritated. They don't form dentin if they sense that the pulp doesn't need protection.</p>
<p>So when infection reached the pulp - dentin forming cells sense the danger and start forming dentin, but their rate of dentin formation is slow and infection ultimately reaches the pulp and kills the dentin forming cells, further inhibiting dentin formation. Ultimately the pulp is infected and, if not treated, it dies.</p>
<p>TL;DR - cells that form amd repair bones remain throughout your life. Cells that form (and can repair) teeth die as soon as their job is complete.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
