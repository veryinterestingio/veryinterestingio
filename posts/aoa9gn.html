		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Laces are good for a few reasons. </p>
<ol>
<li>Velcro wears out relatively quickly. Every time you undo some velcro it gets damaged a bit and every day it becomes a little less 'sticky.' This is no big deal on kids' sneakers but military gear has durability as a top priority.</li>
<li>You can easily carry spare laces and any man can replace the laces on his boots when needed. Properly attaching the velcro straps to the boot usually requires stitching them on which is a skill to be learned, hand-stitching onto tough leather isn't something anyone can just do properly especially if it needs to be done in less-than-ideal conditions. </li>
<li>You can easily adjust your lacing to make things tighter or looser on any specific part of the boot, which is good as feet shapes vary, calluses, blisters, and corns can appear requiring adjustments, etc.</li>
<li>Stuff sticks to velcro (dirt, sand, hair, clothing fibers, etc) and the velcro doesn't stick properly when it does. Shoelaces don't care how dirty they are.</li>
<li>Velcro straps are unlikely to stand up to as much stress/load as properly done strong shoelaces.</li>
<li>Boa closing systems are cool but may be more breakable, harder to replace quickly, and may work less well when clogged/dirty/wet. The military wants, as much as possible, stuff that will work fine even after being dragged through a muddy river for hours and can be replaced in 2 minutes by the person wearing them if need be.</li>
<li>Laces distribute pressure really well which is really important, it's not like you can say &quot;let's take a 15 minute break so I can rub my sore feet.&quot; To distribute the pressure as well using velcro you'd need at least as many straps as eyelets.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of times simpler designs are preferred even if they seem less practical because of interchangeable parts.</p>
<p>If a bootlace snaps, you lace up a new one. It costs next to nothing and spare laces are easy/convenient to have on hand at all times. </p>
<p>Even when you don’t have extra laces, paracord can be used as a substitute. </p>
<p>With Velcro and Boa mechanisms, a failure is far more catastrophic and can render the entire boot defective. This is not a good thing if the closest replacement is a 50 mile hike away. </p>
<p>TL;DR, a broken lace is easier to fix in the field and won’t ruin a boot. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Military boots have long durable laces. You don't completely undo them just get them loose enough to get your feet out. After a few weeks of basic you can get back into your boots and secure them in just a few seconds. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tanker boots don't have laces as they can become untied and tangle up on something. They can also burn, which is also why tanker boots are all leather with no nylon or canvas. Leather straps only.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
