		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Content Distribution Networks (CDN for short) are used.  Basically, you request to watch a film on Netflix, then Netflix responds with &quot;Sure, here is your film!&quot; - behind the scenes, a CDN that is located near you will provide the actual data for that film to you.  </p>
<p>500k people can watch the same film at the same time from Netflix, but the data that is sent to those 500k people will be coming from 1 of the many, many CDNs that Netflix own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You ask for ice-cream, your parents go to the nearby shop and get it for you.</p>
<p>Similarly, some kid in another town asks for ice-cream, their parent goes to their nearby shop to get the ice-cream.</p>
<p>The parents aren't going to the ice-cream factory. Ice-cream factory sends ice-cream to relevant shops, so that ice-creams are available for everyone!</p>
<p>In netflix's case, the ice-cream is a movie. The nearby shop is a netflix machine that's close to your home. You ask for a movie, and its served by a machine near your home.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They put their own cache servers into ISP's too. They have or had a page to request them. It's a win win, as netflix gets content closer to their customers, and ISP doesn't pay for the traffic on the internet side.
Page still there, it's their open connect appliance.. &quot;Our appliances are provided free of charge for ISP partners who meet our basic requirements, but they are not for sale to other parties.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what has already been mentioned, Netflix doesn't put their whole catalog into CDN and cache. They would bankrupt themselves if they tried to do that. The clever part is guessing which films and content to cache where in a way that minimizes latency access the whole system.</p>
<p>Straight statistics helps, but being able to predict which films individuals will want to watch with better accuracy than the overall statistics is how they make money. They improve their bottom line by saving money on storage and bandwidth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to the answers already given. Half a million people watching the same content isn't as stressful to the system as OP might assume. In fact, its the opposite (because it can use the cached data). A worst case scenario for Netflix would be the very opposite,  loads of people all watching <strong>different</strong> things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
