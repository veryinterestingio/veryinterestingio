		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don’t just check knee reflexes. We can check ankles, soles of your feet, biceps, triceps, jaw jerk, pupils, gag reflex, and several others too. </p>
<p>Each reflex gives us information about what might be going on. The ones at the joints, like the knee one that everybody knows, can give information about conditions affecting the entire body like electrolyte disturbances, but also by testing at different sites it can give information about where in the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves or muscles the problem is, and which side of the body is affected.</p>
<p>This information, coupled with assessment of muscle power, muscle tone, abnormal movements, gait, speech, cognition, vision, hearing, temperature sensation, vibration sensation, pain sensation, soft touch, pin prick sensation, joint position sense (with your eyes closed) can lead to the diagnosis. </p>
<p>To do a full neurological assessment takes a long time - by far the longest examination to perform on a patient if you are doing it properly and completely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Testing the reflex can give you an idea of if there is any damage to the spinal cord or nervous system. Overactive or under active reflexes can also be a sign of other medical conditions </p>
<p>Hyperreflexia, or overactive reflexes can be a sign of hyperthyroidism, electrolyte imbalance, severe brain trauma, multiple sclerosis and preeclampsia </p>
<p>Hyporeflexia, or absent reflexes, can be a sign of ALS, Guillain-Barré syndrome, hypothyroidism, stroke</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a little out dated in terms of assessments but it is a super common procedure. The default reaction is striking the tendon there causes the nerve to spasm the muscle as a result of wanting to protect you from the &quot;attack&quot;.</p>
<p>No kick could mean a neurological issue as well as would an exaggerated or inappropriate response. However, it isn't a super accurate thing. Even if you dont kick, it doesnt mean anything. Theyd have to do much more specific assessments and use actual machines to see if there is an issue and odds are you would be presenting with an issue already.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
