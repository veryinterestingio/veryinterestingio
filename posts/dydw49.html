		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A human raised in similar conditions to animals winds up with very thick skin on the hands, feet and sun exposed areas. </p>
<p>Look at the skin on the feet of individuals who regularly walk barefoot and it's often quite thick, then combine that with the increased need for thick skin on uneven, rocky ground.</p>
<p>Most mammals have relatively similar skin, with examples like rhinos, elephants and other savannah animals being an exception due to the increased need for protection from sun and predators, as well as the need for water retention.</p>
<p>The average indoor human, though, has thinner skin than we otherwise would have, being more similar to subterranean or nocturnal animals like moles and mice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't answer your entire question, but I think it's worth noting that different skins/hides have different properties that might influence strength, depending on your definition. For example, falconers tend to use kangaroo leather because while it's not terribly difficult to pierce, it's very difficult to tear, unless you know the precise grain direction. Other mammalian leathers fail to meet with this requirement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's important to consider scale. To a rhinoceros horn you're not very thick at all, but on the scale of insects we are quite tough. There are areas of your skin that are tough enough that a mosquito can't bite you there, for example. We are definitely more vulnerable than most mammals, but to some creatures we are quite resilient still!</p>
<p>The skin of an ancient human who likely had more scars, callouses, and weathering, would likely be much stronger than ours. But we live pretty easy lives, and usually prefer softer skin over tougher skin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you compare humans to closest relative primates, our skin is softer and weaker but more sensitive. We need it more that way. I think itâ€™s maybe also a (by)product of neoteny - an evolutionary change which made humans keep child abilities (ability to learn, more emotions and less instinct etc) into adulthood. But it also meant we kept also some physical ones (soft skin, less body hair, soft face features, ...). We are more similar to a chimpanzee baby than to an adult.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
