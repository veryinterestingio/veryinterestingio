		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The US government sells treasury notes that mature in 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, and 30 years.  These treasury notes sell for a price with a
&quot;coupon&quot;(interest rate), with these two factors you can figure out the yield of the bond.  Generally longer term bonds need to offer higher yields to sell because there is more risk for the investor</p>
<p>The yield curve is what you get if you plot the yield rate for all the bonds on a scatter plot.  In general it should be relatively flat at the bottom but steadily increasing towards the high end.  Today, the 2, 3, 5, and 7 year notes had yields of 2.83, 2.84, 2.83, and 2.90 respectively.  You can see that the 3 year note had a higher yield than the 5 year note which is abnormal.</p>
<p>Now this could indicate that investors see increased risk in the 5+ year window which is generally considered long term while those below are short term, or it could mean the Fed has been pumping out more bonds and needs to offer better rates to get people to buy them up.</p>
<p>Yield curve inversions have occurred before the previous recessions, but often by a few years(happened in 05 before the 08 crash) so people will likely be selling doom and gloom for a little while, but we'll have to wait to see if it actually means anything this time</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The yield on a bond is the percentage return the investor gets for agreeing to lend money to someone, in this case the U.S. Treasury.  In this context, it can be thought of the sweetener that convinces someone to fork over their cash and have it tied up for a certain length of time.</p>
<p>Generally, if someone's cash is going to be tied up for 10 years, you need to pay them more (per year) than you do if they only agree to have it tied up for 2 years.  So the yield of 10 year US Treasuries is almost always higher than 2 years.</p>
<p>But sometimes that relationship is reversed, and that is called the inverted yield.  </p>
<p>So why would it ever invert?  Well, that is because people suddenly think it's a better investment to park in treasuries over a long time rather than other forms of investment, like the stock market or the short term bonds. They effectively WANT to be ensured that rate of return, even for the inconvenience of having your money tied up.</p>
<p>So why would someone want that?  Because they think the economy is going to tank.  When the economy tanks, stocks plummet and the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates.  So whatever the rate is now, it's going to be LOWER 2 years from now, so you might as well buy the longer term bond so you aren't stuck having to invest your money into a recession.</p>
<p>So today, the 3 and 5 year bonds inverted.  That is not as extreme as the 2 and 10, which is the typical measurement for recession inverting, and there might be other pressures that caused it to tip considering how close to terms are (3 and 5).  So it's a bit of a &quot;maybe it's not as bad as all that&quot; moment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
