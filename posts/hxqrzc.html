		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, as expected, most individuals so far have given subjective personal accounts on what would be true.</p>
<p>There has been <em>some</em> research evidence over the years to suggest that younger is better (to a certain extent). Newport and Johnson^(1) did a research study on native speakers against immigrants who picked up a second language. They demonstrated that younger children (7 and under) spoke a language as grammatically correct as native speakers, while older children and adults struggled more readily. This work has been criticized by other researchers, however. Bailystok^(2) overviews a few papers and studies on whether age really matters. Most don't really provide any direct evidence, but instead default to it &quot;mattering&quot; due to younger speakers often having a higher ability in said languages</p>
<p>Research is this field is very difficult to parse, however, due to the fact that younger speakers often come from families with links to said language. Learning Spanish at 3 years old vs 12 years old is likely the difference between learning naturally at home (with more practice and immersion) versus learning at school. To my knowledge, there is no definitive link towards learning a language being easier at a younger age. We often just have more time and practice when a young child than we do as an older child or adult.</p>

<p>Linguistics major here. To me, your question boils down to the following:<br />
<strong>which is quicker, childhood language acquisition or second language acquisition?</strong><br />
I think I can answer this by handling each half:</p>
<p>“Do children actually learn language<del>s</del> quicker than adults?&quot;   <strong><em>Yes.</em></strong></p>
<p>Unlike adults learning a second language (L2), children learn language from nothing starting at age 0. Someone mentioned the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_period_hypothesis" target="_blank">critical period hypothesis</a>, which hypothesizes that a window of time exists (0-5 years) for children to develop language skill (different linguists believe in different time windows). After this window, language acquisition becomes a lot harder. The often-cited example is in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_child" target="_blank">feral children</a>, kids who grow up without human contact (without language) and who therefore miss learning language during the critical period (or <em>sensitivity period</em>). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genie_(feral_child)" target="_blank">Genie</a> is the well-known case we looked at, and you can see that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_development_of_Genie#Post-1975" target="_blank">her speech is pretty terrible</a> at around age 18. My opinion is that Genie’s language will not improve, largely due to missing the critical period timing. Her language acquisition is incredibly impaired, and I don’t think even other native English speakers would call her fluent.</p>
<p>“Do we just put way more effort into teaching children than we do adults?”   <strong><em>No.</em></strong></p>
<p>Children will learn language <a href="https://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/faq-how-do-we-learn-language" target="_blank">automatically</a> even if their parents don’t directly teach them. There are many language features children learn without instruction, like <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3487416/" target="_blank">distinguishing distinct sounds</a> (phonemes) from <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222704467_Learning_words'_sounds_before_learning_how_words_sound_9-Month-olds_use_distinct_objects_as_cues_to_categorize_speech_information" target="_blank">not-distinct sounds</a> (I’m referring to allophones here), or how to understand a garden path sentence (<a href="http://www.academypublication.com/ojs/index.php/jltr/article/download/jltr080611901194/1287" target="_blank">link</a> is a PDF paper), or even discriminating foreign words from <a href="https://psychology.wikia.org/wiki/Pseudowords" target="_blank">non-words</a> (pseudowords). There’s simply too much language for adults to teach kids: phonology (sounds), morphology (word construction), syntax (word order), semantics (meaning), and pragmatics (meaning in context). I’ll mention a related theory, the theory of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_of_the_stimulus#cite_note-DeBot_2015-4" target="_blank">poverty of the stimulus</a>: that children learn words, sounds, constructions, grammars that they <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=ry6uzDn5IlUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP12&amp;dq=poverty+of+the+stimulus&amp;ots=NUm6jQ55kM&amp;sig=yMPJTejtyANQkCO7Nn9E7PC6cH8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">could not have learned</a> from parental instruction.</p>
<p>So in terms of time, children have to learn language from the ground up. Maybe it takes them twelve years. But for adults, who have already mastered many aspects of language, learning a second language takes less time. Yet at the same time, a child will become bilingual faster if they’re taught both languages simultaneously, compared to an adult learning their native language then a second language “after” (in their adulthood).</p>
<p><strong><em>TLDR; an adult learns a second language faster than a child,</em></strong></p>
<p>but a child learns language faster than an adult (e.g. a feral child). And children put more effort into learning language than we do into teaching them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
