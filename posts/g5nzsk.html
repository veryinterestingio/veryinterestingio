		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Diseases to ruin your civilisation 101:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must have high R0: ie. each infectee must infect multiple others.  Either be outrageously contagious or have a very long asymptomatic-but-infectious period.  If there is existing immunity in the population you must evolve around prior immunity (like flu) or be infectious enough to spread though a disparate vulnerable population (measles, pertussis, chickenpox)</li>
<li>Be lethal.  This conflicts directly with point 1 because dead people are not very sociable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore it is hard for any pre-existing human disease to meet these requirements, as high lethality is maladaptive for germs.</p>
<p>It is therefore most likely for a pandemic to be an emergent zoonotic infection; an animal germ that is newly learning to infect humans effectively. Given that we are then inventing a hypothetical pathogen, you can kind of choose whatever you want as the next pandemic-causer.</p>
<p>The most probable infections are going to come from diseases whose current hosts are in close proximity to humans (farm animals) or have virulent living conditions (eg. bats).  You would also want a germ that targets a receptor that is relatively well-conserved (ie. similar) across humans and the target population -- such as the ACE2 that COVID targets.</p>
<p>Honestly, nothing is really that probable, which is why lethal pandemics have been rare in history.  The only families of germs with proven potential to cause pandemics are those that we have already seen achieve it, so I would say high risk families are flu, coronaviruses and coccobacilli.</p>
<p>At a lower tier, we may worry about things similar to HIV (Retroviridae), ebola (filoviridae), leprosy (mycobacteria , as is TB) and rabies (Rhabdoviridae); pathogens that are nasty and known or suspected to be zoonotic. However they each have their own impediments to future relatives becoming pandemics, chiefly that they are not sufficiently infectious.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Smallpox has been eradicated through vaccination, cholera's provenance (typically water contamination) is well understood, and plague is still fairly common but treatable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
