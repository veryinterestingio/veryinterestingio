		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that some or many cancers are problematic because they don't trigger our immune system's usual response to dangerous foreign objects. Looking like normal cells, our body lets them grow freely. One newer approach to fighting cancer is treatments that selectively &quot;flag&quot; these cells as foreign, so our immune system itself will deal with them. This seems an improvement on the traditional chemotherapy, which focused on killing off all new cells, on the argument that cancer cells reproduce more rapidly than regular cells, so you'd be mainly killing cancer . . . while also causing rapidly reproducing hair cells to die in the process. The new approach seems promising, but does it require a different cancer-flagging treatment for every specific type of cancer, or are there enough similarities in cancer cells that only a few types of flaggers would be needed? And, given your focus on evolution, would cancer cells likely evolve defenses that would require continual flagger updating? Or is this approach so fundamental that the cancer cells could not evolve their way out?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
