		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>smiling isn't just your teeth showing.  smiling is MOSTLY your cheeks lifting.  when your cheeks lift, they  do often stretch open the mouth, exposing your teeth, but that's a byproduct.  the real gesture comes from the initial squint and raising of the eyebrows.  </p>
<p>by squinting your eyes, you're closing your field of view, blocking out additional information - if the brows are lowering over the eyes, this is to defend the eyes - the eyebrows tend to absorb more of the light, giving your eyes a better focus on what's ahead, but if your eyebrows are rising too, you're basically exposing yourself.  it's the equivalent of a palm up, empty handed gesture to show you're not hostile.  it should also be noted that communicating with facial expressions is something we were able to do long before using our hands.  </p>
<p>so now, raise your eyebrows, and bring your cheeks up, that's about as &quot;non-threatening as you can get.  </p>
<p>if you bare your teeth at someone with a growly unhappy mouth shape, you can bet that still reads as hostile.  </p>
<p>because the smile never had to do with the teeth, i think the lips parting in a smile is just more comfortable than the tightlipped variant, and so it's seen as much genuine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what others are saying, I want to throw out that we &quot;hear&quot; smiles as well. People can reliably choose sentences that are spoken with a smile over those spoken without, without seeing the people speaking obv. There are some competing theories as to what this means, anthropologically. Since it raises the pitch of utterances (a VAST oversimplification), some hypothesize that it developed as an auditory way to sound &quot;small&quot; and, hence, non-threatening. Others think it could even be due to courtship and how it evolved (basically, a way to indicate our happiness or pleasure to a mate in places with low light). I'm on the fence because I think that the linguists tend to ignore the obvious visual component of smiling, but I still thought it was interesting and a different perspective from what we usually see with this type of question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I’ll borrow from my communication systems background to shed light on what’s going on.</p>
<p>When you have a very important message to make, you’ve got to make sure it gets delivered without a chance of being corrupted.</p>
<p>Smiling is unmistakable facial expression and as such it became associated with the most important expression people need to express: friendliness, joy, happiness etc…</p>
<p>That expression of happiness is so disarming that it was very important to be associated with unmistakable facial expression.</p>
<p>For us, social animals, being at peace and in cooperation is the most important signal we can make to each other.</p>
<p>Other non social or less social animal, dedicate this visible expression to express threat or aggression. Because for them that’s the most important expression they need to make.</p>
<p>Now think about it, why wasn’t the expression of happiness and joy mapped to an ambiguous facial expression like lifting your eyebrows ? Because it can be easily mistaken. Whereas having wide smile (ear to ear) is so much more visible and unmistakable.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't back this up with a source because I'm too lazy to look it up. BUT I went to a wolf preserve in Colorado where they let you get in the enclosure with  a couple of the wolves. If one of the wolves bears its teeth and approaches you its supposedly trying to connect with you. So what you're supposed to do is bear you teeth as well and the wolf will come click its teeth on yours. Apparently wolves do this to each other. I dunno. But I talked to a lady who said she got to click her teeth with the wolves. The wolves didn't seem interested in me at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
