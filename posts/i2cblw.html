		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water has a tendency to want to stick to itself, this leads to surface tension (where something light like a bug can walk on water) and it is the reason it forms into roughly spherical drops.</p>
<p>The cloud is a bunch of mist/fog (ie lots of water floating around in very very small drops). When conditions are right these very small drops will start sticking together, get heavier, and when they get heavy enough, fall as a raindrop.</p>
<p>A limiting factor is air resistance while the drop falls. Water likes to stick together, but air resistance is trying to tear it apart. So a massive basketball sized &quot;drop&quot; can't happen because the friction/resistance is too strong. The size of the drop is kind of a balance between to air forces acting on the outside of the drop trying to tear it apart, and the intermolecular forces in the water trying to hold itself together.</p>

And wind resistance would break it off quicker than new droplets being added. Also we should be glad it works this way. For the alternative I highly recommend you read this:

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So think about what is happening in the clouds. Water vapor is suspended in the air. Eventually it cools and condenses. Think about what happens when you drink s cold soda on a hot day. Liquid water forms around the can, right? Well in the clouds, there are tiny particles of dust or other things. When the water vapor cools, it condenses around these particles, forming raindrops. Eventually the raindrops are heavy enough to fall from the cloud.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Clouds are made up of water vapor (teeny tiny bits of water) and other things like dust. The bits are able to rise into the sky because they are lighter than air. As it gets colder, the little bits of vapor and dust start to huddle together. As soon as enough bits are huddled close enough together, they get heavier than air and start to fall. It doesn't take much huddling before this happens, so the water falls as lots of little huddles of drops. </p>
<p>If the water could make larger huddles without falling, it would. Or if they all huddled close enough at the same time, maybe whole clouds would fall at the same time. But the vapor bits are spread out, so it's a lot more likely enough of them to make a drop will find each other and get heavy before more can join and make a bigger huddle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
