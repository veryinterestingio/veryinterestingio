I just said, oh, cool and didn’t ask for more info for some reason. So... what does it mean? What is it that they are measuring, and why is the max at 120?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Antibody amounts are usually given as a “titer”, which is the dilution (or inverse dilution) of amount that will minimally do something. “Do something” might mean neutralize virus, or might be some relatively artificial read-out like the ability to change colors in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). For example, you might be able to dilute your plasma 1 to 108 and still see it neutralize a certain amount of virus. </p>
<p>The max readout, of course, depends entirely on the specific test. The FDA guidelines include this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the US, the FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for COVID-19 convalescent plasma, originally from August 2020 and subsequently revised, recommends a neutralizing antibody titer of ≥250 in the Broad Institute’s neutralizing antibody assay, a signal-to-cutoff (S/C) of ≥12 in the Ortho VITROS IgG assay, or a level of ≥1:2880 in the Mount Sinai COVID-19 ELISA IgG Antibody Test; these units are labeled as “High Titer COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma” or “High Titer CCP” [37-39]. Units with lower titers may be labeled as “COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma of Low Titer” and used if high titer units are not available. Prior to August 2020, titers of 1:160 or even 1:80 using a variety of different assays were considered acceptable if higher-titer units were not available [40].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—<a href="https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-convalescent-plasma-and-hyperimmune-globulin" target="_blank">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Convalescent plasma and hyperimmune globulin</a></p>
<p>Since we don’t know which assay you were tested with, we can’t say more than that.  The “max” number is, obviously, entirely artificial.  If it’s saying you can neutralize a certain amount of virus at a dilution of 108, another company could just put a tenth as much virus in there and voila, you’d have a titer of 1080 (simplified). Or they could put twice as much in and you’d have a titer of 54. Doesn’t matter, so long as they’re consistent and know what they’re looking for.</p>
<p><em>edit</em> here’s a nice summary from the <a href="https://ccpp19.org/healthcare_providers/virology/antibodies.html" target="_blank">National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ASSAY RESULTS. </p>
<p>Qualitative Tests. The majority of serologic tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are qualitative, meaning that they provide results as only ‘positive’, ‘negative’ or ‘indeterminate/equivocal’. Although these serologic tests still result in a number (e.g., index value, signal-to-cut-off [S/Co] ratio, etc.), these numbers do not indicate the actual antibody level and should not be reported.</p>
<p>Semi-Quantitative or Quantitative Tests. Increasingly, serologic test manufacturers are developing methods that provide antibody levels in the blood sample.</p>
<p>For these tests, the amount of antibody may be reported as titers, arbitrary units per milliliter (AU/mL) or unit per milliliter (U/mL), among others.</p>
<p>Importantly, because there is no standard against which all such quantitative assays can be compared against, the values generated by one kind of test cannot be compared to another. It must be stated, that the results from qualitative and quantitative assays generally correlate very highly in terms of concordance.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's the general idea. Imagine you had a glass of very red liquid. You take a teaspoon of it and dump it in a swimming pool. Can you see the red? Of course not. However, if you put it in one cup, you probably could. Maybe your could at 2 C. Maybe still at 10 cups. But once you get to 128 cups, you can barely see the red. At 129 C, the red seems gone. You so you call the amount of red 128. You could do the same thing with any red liquid and compare it to that and measure how red it is using the same method. Perhaps its redness is between 30 and 40 red. Since you also tested a 1 to 50, 1 to 60, etc dilution, you can do some fancy math and calculate your estimate of how red it is.</p>
<p>For an antibody titer, you can measure all sorts of things that could correspond to redness. It could be the amount of antibody that literally turns a chemical reaction red, or makes it glow, or inactivates actual virus.</p>
<p>So the question is, where did 120 come from? In my example, you could just arbitrarily call the max redness 100 or 160 or 200 or whatever you want.</p>
<p>In some titer assays, 120 is a true measure of redness measured by some fancier method. For example, the max redness you can measure on your test corresponds to exactly 120 red molecules per teaspoon measured some other way.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what 120 means in this case though. They arbitrarily chose a teaspoon to measure, largely out of convenience. Maybe they simply stopped at 120 cups because it was a nice round number. Maybe that was the largest container they had. Maybe they did some fancy statistics and decided that they could measure more than 120, but not reliable so they chose that cutoff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
