		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine that apps are litte robots in your phone. They are all asleep in little bunk beds. When you launch an app, its robot wakes up and starts talking to you. </p>
<p>When you switch to a new app, the old app’s robot now has nothing to do. On big phones, there could be room for two app robots to be awake at the same time.  On small phones, there’s only enough room for one robot at a time, so the old robot goes back to its bunk bed and goes to sleep.  Even on a big phone, the robot might get bored with no one to talk to and put itself to bed. </p>
<p>When you launch the old app again, its robot wakes up, but it’s forgotten everything it was doing so it has to start all over from the beginning. </p>
<p>But smart robot makers know this makes users sad!  They give their robots a litte notebook, so when they go to sleep they can write down everything they were doing.  That way, when they wake up, they can look at the notebook and remember just what to do to pick up where they left off.</p>
<p>It is a little more trouble for the robot maker to teach the robot how to use a notebook, but it’s so much nicer for everyone if they do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an iOS developer I can tell you the reason for iOS with absolute certainty: apps which use the least memory are killed last by the OS. When your phone needs more memory, it asks every app to free some memory. Those that don't free enough when they're using a lot are terminated.</p>
<p>As a result, some apps stay open indefinitely because they are hardly using any.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about iOS, only Android.</p>
<p>The simplest case is when your phone has enough ram to work with that your previous app can stay open in the background.</p>
<p>Basically what happens is that Android tries to manage your phone's resources (CPU, RAM, battery life etc.) as efficiently as possible. This means that sometimes it has to stop applications that are running in the background to make space for the app that is currently in focus.</p>
<p>Also, Android provides the possibility for apps to not outright close, but to be put into a hibernated state. Think of it like freezing the application and saving it like you would save a file. When you open the app again, the app is defrosted and you can continue where you left off, giving the impression that the app was running in the background all along.</p>
<p>In most cases having this hibernation in an application requires more work from the developers. If they decide not to support it, the app will just close, that is why it takes you back to the start screen.</p>
<p>tl;dr: your phone might have enough ram to have multiple apps running in the background, or the closed app's state is saved to storage, which is loaded again once it comes back to focus</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, this is called Tombstoning, or &quot;&quot;remember the apps last known state.&quot;</p>
<p>The phones provide a means to tombstone (iOS, Android).  However, it's up to each application developer to <em>actually write</em> the code to save, and restore, the state of the app.</p>
<p>Leave a low rating for the app saying as such.  Either you have a good developer, that does this or will listen to ratings.  Or, the app dev doesn't give a frack and does whatever.  It will show you the quality of the app you are using (and makes you wonder what else is wrong with the app).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
