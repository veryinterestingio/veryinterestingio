		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The idea that Shakespeare invented new words wholecloth is a bit oversimplified. What scholars think is more likely is that he used slang and casual language that other writers of the time considered too crude or vulgar to put to their great works, and so the academics had never had to contend with these words in their formal work before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the words credited to Shakespeare are not nonce words. That is to say they are not made up gibberish with no basis. Shakespeare instead would take words that already existed and tweak them a bit. He would take two words or even whole phrases and take them a part and then frankensteinly put them back together. He would also famously turn nouns into verbs instilling the nature of the noun into an action. In the same way i can turn frankenstein into an adverb Shakespeare would turn noun into verbs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>National Geographic explains why so many words are attributed to Shakespeare:</p>
<p>Despite Shakespeare’s apparently considerable contributions to the language, Macrone and other academics are quick to caution that it is almost impossible say with absolutely certainty when a word or phrase was first used—or even whom to credit for creating it. In Shakespeare’s case, many of the words and phrases attributed to him merely debuted in their modern permutations in his writings and can actually be traced back to older forms. Other words and turns of phrase are indeed “original,” insomuch as they are documented in the written record only as far back as Shakespeare.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
