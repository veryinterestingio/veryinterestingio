		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto! Hey Reddit, happy National Robotics Week!</p>
<p>These days, robots are not just fodder for 1980s Styx songs. Nor are they always famously featured in TV shows or movies, like Rosie from The Jetsons.</p>
<p>At the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, robots are the workhorses that help our scientists advance energy storage and bioenergy research.</p>
<p>For example, robotic platforms are integral to helping us investigate and develop materials for energy storage applications to bolster modernization of the nation's grid.  These robotic partners help our scientists do more experiments with significantly lower labor and material costs than if conducted manually. They also allow us to effectively test formulations - literally thousands of them - for the most optimal materials conditions.</p>
<p>In the bioenergy realm, robots housed in our <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/high-throughput-center" target="_blank">High Throughput Center</a> handle routine and repetitive tasks and empower our researchers to investigate materials while accelerating understanding and production of biofuels and bioproducts. With the robots' help, multiple experiments can run in parallel, helping us perform hundreds more experiments than with manual methods.  One catalyst testing instrument can reduce four months of research to just two weeks.  Additionally, one sample preparation robot can produce more than 200 formulations in a single day, something that would take a researcher a full week to do - not to mention keeping track of it all, often with greater accuracy and precision, while avoiding repetitive strain injury.</p>
<p>Our research in grid energy storage and bioenergy is typically supported by the U.S. Department of Energy's <a href="https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity" target="_blank">Office of Electricity</a> and <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/bioenergy" target="_blank">Bioenergy Technologies Office</a>, respectively.</p>
<p>We &quot;bot&quot; you think all this robot talk is cool! We sure do.</p>
<p>Come ask us questions about our cool energy storage and bioenergy breakthroughs and how our robots are helping. We will be back at noon PDT (3 PM ET, 19 UT) to answer your questions!</p>

<p>On a side question I guess for anyone that would like to answer, how realistically is it for a battery in the &quot;near&quot; future, for example that of a phone, to last more than a couple of days at best?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
