		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are genetic markers in DNA known as SNPs (Single nucleotide polymorphisms), essentially single letter changes in DNA. Certain populations and ethnic groups have a makeup of genetic markers that are unique to the ancestry and history of a population. By looking at which markers you have and which markers are shared between you and other people from particular regions we can determine which parts of your DNA are shared by a common ancestor from that region.</p>
<p>EDIT: I am astounded how many people without a firm grasp of population genetics and coalescent theory are weighing in on this saying that is a scam/sham. It's not! It's based on genetics and statistics! There are entire fields of research that focus on the history and demographics of human genetics and they are very rigorous. No technique is 100% accurate, but to say it's a complete sham is completely ignorant of the scientific background. Source: Am a geneticist</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>General gist: Every person is made up of DNA inherited from their parents. As DNA is copied to each new generation, slight changes can occur (mutations). These mutations sometimes get passed on to the next generation (and the next and the next). Until recent times, people didn’t travel far from the place they grew up, marrying people from the same area and having children - eventually many of these children all carry the same mutation. As populations expand, these children marry other people with the same mutation, carrying it further. This means that over time, these slight changes can become indicative of certain populations - we can identify specific patterns (series of mutations) in DNA that can be associated with specific areas of the world. Think of this like a unique fingerprint of people who lived in a specific region.</p>
<p>Through projects like the human genome project, we are able to sequence DNA from people all over the world. Using their self reported data (usually the birthplace of their grandparents), these DNA samples can be grouped together into clusters - for example, you might group together all the people who indicate their four grandparents were all born in France. Then you would compare within the group to see if there is a unique pattern that can be observed in the majority (a statistically significant majority) of those samples.</p>
<p>Once patterns for that group are identified, you would compare against other groups to see if the patterns are unique to a population or shared among other populations. This lets you form a theory (and a computer algorithm that will do future analysis for you) about which DNA fingerprints belong to specific populations. </p>
<p>Then you test this theory using other control samples not from your original research group, to see if your computer algorithm can reliably assign new samples into their correct regional groups. </p>
<p>Your ancestry results show percentages based on how much of your DNA matches these unique regional fingerprints - I encourage people to think of their results as regions and not necessarily ethnicities, because in many cases they use modern country labels that may not be accurate for you (for example someone who receives French/German results might have ancestry in France, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Austria, northern Italy, etc etc - places which were once part of Germanic kingdoms, essentially).</p>
<p>Your DNA sample is analyzed and run through the algorithm over and over again, and your results are based on the average output of the algorithm. So if you get 42% French/German, that doesn’t necessarily mean you are exactly 42% French/German, but what it does mean is that the algorithm is confident based on the matching of DNA patterns that a significant portion (nearly half) of your DNA is from the area defined by the company as being French/German.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>&quot;[They are] not going to tell you every place or every group in the world where people share your DNA. Nor will they necessarily be able to tell you exactly where your ancestors lived or [what race or social group] they identified with. &quot;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>They aren't accurate or precise. They are more for fun. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, they don't determine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group" target="_blank">ethnicity</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An ethnic group or an ethnicity, is a category of people who identify with each other based on similarities such as common ancestry, language, history, society, culture or nation. Ethnicity is usually an inherited status based on the society in which one lives. Membership of an ethnic group tends to be defined by a shared cultural heritage, ancestry, origin myth, history, homeland, language or dialect, symbolic systems such as religion, mythology and ritual, cuisine, dressing style, art or physical appearance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The way these companies abuse the term and the concept in their marketing is one of the problems with them.  That's something to beware in anything they tell you—they're not interested in educating the public, but more than anything in amassing tons of DNA samples to sell to third parties, an second to that, selling their DNA test kits and genealogy services (e.g. &quot;DNA cousins&quot; or whatever they call it, which actually is a better service than their ancestry region estimates).</p>
<p>Setting that aside, a very broad explanation would be this:</p>
<ol>
<li>They take DNA samples from a bunch of people that they call their <strong>reference populations</strong>—people whose genealogy they understand is from a specific location for a few centuries.</li>
<li>They compare your DNA to that of the reference populations and use a statistical model to make an educated guess where your ancestors were from within a certain timescale (up to, say, 300-500 years).</li>
</ol>
<p>It's important to understand that it's an educated guess—they can't  actually tell where your ancestors were from 300 years ago, but they're not pulling it from where the sun don't shine either.  Also:</p>
<ul>
<li>The broader categories (e.g. Africa vs. Europe vs. Asia/Americas) are more reliable than the narrower ones (Senegal, Italy, Japanese).</li>
<li>Categories that show up with very small percentages can be unreliable.</li>
<li>The people from the places their test tells you often show up with significant results from other neighboring areas.</li>
<li>They use DNA from current-day people, not people from 500 years ago. This can throw off results as well; one example I've heard is that so many people fled Ireland in the 19th century that it's likely some DNA that was Irish 500 years ago today only exists outside Ireland.</li>
