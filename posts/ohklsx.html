		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>NumLock and ScrollLock both exist for those people who are spreadsheet <del>Archmages</del> experts</p>
<p>The number pad is by far the fastest way to punch numbers into a spreadsheet repeatedly, that's why it exists.  Having access to arrow keys on the same hand speeds up navigation of nearby cells while access to Home (go to the left-most cell), End (goes to the right-most cell), Page up, and Page down speed up access to distant points on the sheet.</p>
<p>Scroll lock is another key that exists almost solely for navigation of spreadsheets.  If you are in Excel and you turn on ScrollLock you can use the arrow keys to move the screen without losing the cell that you're in so you can pan up and right to see columns/rows you may be missing but still be able to type in your selected cell.  Again, just a key that exists almost solely for improved navigation in spreadsheet programs</p>
<p>So your next thought is, why do we need keys for this?  You can clearly just use the mouse to move around or click on the cell you want</p>
<p>Except for many years you didn't have a mouse.  Back in the before times, a lot of &quot;computers&quot; were terminals that accessed a mainframe and timeshared, LANPAR was a spreadsheet program for Mainframes back in 1969.  Microsoft DOS didn't support a mouse until 1982, and mice were uncommon until around 1985.  That's about 25 years of spreadsheet programs being in common use without mice being in common use.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before touchpads and mice, computers started out with just a keyboard. The number pad was a great way to navigate through a document one-handed.</p>
<p>With num-lock off, the arrow keys could precisely position the text cursor and the page up/down and home/end buttons could do larger movements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to /u/mmmmmmBacon12345's excellent point about spreadsheets, a lot of old games used to use numpad for 8-direction movement.  For quite a few years I played games way more than I punched in numbers so I always had numlock off.  With the advent of WASD as a common control scheme that changed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
