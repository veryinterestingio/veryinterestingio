		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the engine.</p>
<p>If the game is made in a game engine that already supports multiple platforms, then it might be as simple as registering a few new variables and formats.</p>
<p>For other games, it might require new chunks of code to support the different hardware. And if you're unlucky: rewriting large amounts of the game.</p>
<p>No matter how you do it, some of the games code will have to be rewritten to support the consoles format, it's just a question of &quot;how much&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>depends really, nowadays most engines support differnt platforms with a button or change of settings. Easier to let unity or epic deal with the details of each console specifications. Mostly ways that the engine talks to the cpu/gpu.</p>
<p>Fun history back in the ps3 and 360 era.. a game where we primary dev'd on a 360 but also supported ps3 and pc.</p>
<p>Things look dandy on a 360 but look weird and mushy and a bit slower on ps3.  From what some of our devs said, the ps3 as powerful as it was with more ram, the process of getting data to the ram was not as great as the 360 so textures cam out meh.  </p>
<p>Sure a first party dev who had more access to methods to doing so on a ps4 could get past that but just shows the pain of using your own engine on muliple platforms.</p>
<p>We got eaten alive by all those stupid,&quot; compare visuals of each platform&quot; reviews yet the gameplay was the same ....</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Each platform speaks a different language. Many game engines speaks multiple languages. So when you program a game in these engines they will already be able to port them to these different platforms. But like google translate, the engines might not pick up on all the idioms or colloquial phrases so those codes need to be rewritten.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
