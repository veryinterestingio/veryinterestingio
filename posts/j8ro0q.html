		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a culturally acquired thing. </p>
<p>I work around a number of professional market gardeners. They get seriously dirty and sweaty every day. I do not find their body aromas offensive in the least. They take normal care to shower after a day's work in the hot sun. None of them wear deodorant, why bother? They are male and female, makes little difference. They often drink a gallon of water in a day, sweating it all out. </p>
<p>When I bring this up the online reactions range from shock to disgust. You guys haven't even sniffed them yet. The aversion to body aromas is a learned, cultural characteristic. Also a very modern one.  A normal healthy person who is sweating and has normal hygeine smells pretty good, actually. Take an actual sniff of one sometime.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From reading the answers, it sounds like it's a combination of things. One thing to add is that we eat much more meat than necessary, and the body odor of a meat eater <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16891352/" target="_blank">smells a bit worse</a> than a vegetarian's. I noticed this on myself when I was a vegetarian for a couple of years, especially after going back to meat. Earlier I'd had a vegetarian girlfriend and her BO was slight, clean and sexy. That's not to say we should all be vegetarians, but maybe cut back a little on meat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is partly a societal construct and what we consider &quot;offensive&quot; can change. For example the perfumes from the early 1900 were very musky and funky often using whale blubber. They fell out of fashion because of puritanical ideas about smelling of sex being bad.</p>
<p>That led to the whole smelling clean phase and the eventual fresh citrus scents that blew up in the 90s as they mimicked cleaning products.</p>
<p>TLDR: Puritans decided smelling like sex is bad and now we consider BO bad</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
