		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My issue is the following: IV administered IgG mixture does seem to work in animal models and in patients. The question really is: does it work on the lung surface? If it does, how? Any papers I have seen suggested that very little IgG reaches the mucosal surface, as the FcnR transport &quot;outside&quot; is not very effective; IgAs use a different mechanism to reach the surface. Yet it seems like IgG based treatments work.</p>
<p>Do they work by limiting the viral replication outside the lung, leaving the lungs &quot;undefended&quot;? Wouldn't this cause serious problems with inflammation in the lungs? The other idea I can think of is that when these are administered, the integrity of the lung tissue is already compromised, so the IgGs can reach the mucosal membrane reasonably well - but this would mean the treatment is not useful as a preventive measure in mild cases when the patient is in a high-risk group.</p>
<p>Since I cannot find any papers discussing the mechanism of IgG therapy within the lungs I thought I would ask here.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Thank you all for the answers, but the strange thing is that none of the responses here actually addressed my question: namely how does IgG reach the mucosal surface -if it ever does in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>Back in my PhD we did some experiments of FcnR mediated IgG transport with intestinal lining -mucosal surface but not lung- and our results were sub 1%, so this is why I am curious how IgG treatments work.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>IgA is only one layer of defense. It is important in the initial acquisition of an infection because of its action at mucosal surfaces. Although IgG isn't as good at getting to mucosal surfaces, it plays a role in preventing the virus from further replicating and spreading. It is even present in mucosal linings to some extent and helps activate immune cells that line the lung's air sacs (alveolar macrophages);</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>IgG is generally a much more powerful activator of the immune system than IgA.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also, IgA's shelf life in the body is only a few days and IgG is a few weeks.</p>

<p>Is this specifically for COVID? IVIG is pretty commonly used in clinic with positive outcomes. AFAIK, there isn't much data regarding COVID, but the data I've seen have shown promise.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>To find the answer to this, you will need to look at the effector functions of different antibody isotypes. Not only can IgG neutralize the virus by preventing it from binding the receptor, it can also activate complement, aid in opsonization, and interact with a number of FcRs which can modulate both the innate and adaptive immune response (most FcgRs activate immune cells and promote phagocytosis, though FcgRIIB can inhibit certain immune responses as well). I won't get into too much detail, but, basically, neutralization as well as the additional effector functions are what make IgG the isotype of choice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't totally speak to all of your questions, but I work for a company helping develop IgG antibody treatments so I might be able to help provide some insight. However, I'm more on the protein sciences side of things, and some of your questions would be better answered by an immunologist.</p>
<p>First off, most of the IgG treatments being developed (the two at Regeneron and Eli Lilly are probably the furthest along in testing AFAIK) are not meant to drive an immune response against the disease as some others have suggested. They're known as neutralizing antibodies, and they act by high affinity (strong) binding to the virus on specific epitopes (binding sites) that disrupt the virus from binding the ACE-2 protein and/or releasing the viral RNA into the host cell.</p>
<p>With a neutralizing antibody treatment the idea isn't that you'll prevent all instances of viral infection, but that you will slow the progress of infection hopefully enough that the host immune system can develop it's own effective response and take over. So yes, as you mentioned it would not necessarily be combating infection on the surface of the lung, although I won't profess to know much about the mechanism of Ig transport to the lung mucosa.</p>
<p>An effective neutralizing antibody treatment would be just that, a treatment and not a cure. They hopefully will only be of limited use in the next 6-12 months while an effective vaccine is developed. However, if a vaccine cannot be developed, or if SARS-CoV-2 proves to be mutable enough that vaccines need to be redeveloped in the future, having a broad panel of neutralizing antibodies will be hugely important.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s a common misconception that the IVIG is used to fight the virus.</p>
<p>IVIG attaches to virus particles throughout the body, which reduces the amount of virus the body’s own immune system sees. This then has a major role in downregulating the strength of the body’s immune response.</p>
<p>In conditions of hyperinflammatory response, such as the way the immune system goes nuts in the lungs of Covid patients, the theory is that turning the volume of that response down will improve health outcomes.</p>
<p>There’s not great evidence for IVIG in Covid, although it is being tried.</p>
