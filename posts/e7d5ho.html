		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In order to see it, the photons from the campfire just needs to fall on your eyes.
But in order to illuminate it needs to fall on an object and then fall on your eyes.
In the first case it doesn't need much intensity (to reach your eyes directly) but in the second case it needs more intensity because many photons will be directed in random directions after falling on the object, making it less probable to fall into your eyes, and intensity decrease with increase in radius. So u can see campfire from far, but can't see objects far from campfire.
Hope it's clear now</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is light from source and there is light from reflected objects.  Light straight from sources are much brighter than light coming from reflected objects because the objects tend to absorb some of it. This is also why sun is brighter than the moon.</p>
<p>Also, if you move twice as far from the campfire. The brightness decreases 4 times and so it can only illuminate a small area. [The brightness of light as a function of the distance from the light source follows an inverse square relationship.]</p>
<p>But the brightness at the middle of the campfire coming from the source is much higher and hence it is easily visible over longer distances.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trying not to get too complicated (and other answers nailed it) bit in electronic warfare theory it's called the &quot;beaconing effect&quot;</p>
<p>The radar emits a signal (light, like your camp fire) and aircraft can see that emission really far away. The problem is that light needs to bounce off the aircraft and get back to the radar. By that time it's much weaker and has scattered more. </p>
<p>Replace the aircraft with a creepy monster standing in a dark forest. They can see the camp fire. But the light isn't strong enough to hit the monster and come back for your eyes to see it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the same reason that you can't see stars during the day.</p>
<p>Light is measured in lux.  Bright sunlight on snow is about 125,000 lux, and starlight on a clear moonless night is about 0.0002 lux.  You can see both of these levels of light, but not at the same time.  </p>
<p>Instead, eyes settle on a a range of &quot;normal&quot;, and have a hard time detecting light less than 1/2000 as bright as whatever your eyes consider to be painfully bright.</p>
<p>So if you are standing next to a fire, your eyes become sensitive to the very brightest level of the fire, down to about 1/2000 that level.  You see things around the fire because light from the fire reflects back to your eyes.  The amount of firelight that is available to reflect gets rapidly smaller with distance.  Also, surfaces like trees and bushes and dirt don't reflect all of the light.  So things that are not that far from the fire look black simply because they aren't reflecting back enough light for your eyes to see, relative to the brightness of the coals.</p>
<p>If you then walk very far from the fire, and wait, your eyes will adapt - may be to moonlight or even starlight if it's very dark.  Starlight is only about 2/10,000 as bright as a single candle reflecting off a 1 square meter of white surface...  </p>
<p>At that level of light even a candle from half a km away might still be visible on a clear night.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing that I am seeing a lot of comments miss: in psychology there is such thing called “just noticeable difference“ which is the minimum difference between two things (such as a difference in light) that a human can make out. Humans have a very low threshold For light differences, which means literally the fire does not have to be that bright to be seen by human. Especially so because the rest of the environment is very dark. This is why we can see the fire from far away even if object surrounding it are not that bright</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
