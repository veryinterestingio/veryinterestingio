		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wombats.  Juvenile wombats are sweet cuddly little dudes with their mothers/humans who are taking care of orphaned wombats, until they hit sexual maturity and turn into huge buttholes.  They attack their moms/caretakers, and that's the sign that it's time for them to move on to find their own territory, alone.  This makes them easy to rehab compared to many other animals, since they have evolved to be sweet until they're ready to trundle out into the wilds to live independently, and so you can basically just release them.  Once they have their own territory, they chill out a bit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dogs have a teenage phase where they rebel against their owners. As a baby puppy they have nothing but adoration and love for you, as a teenager puppy they'd rather stare at you challengingly instead of obeying, or run away in the park to see how far they get. As an adult they get joy from obeying and making you happy.</p>
<p>It's about finding the boundaries they can operate within. I don't know if it's biologically or sociologically linked to the human teenage phase, but we have labelled this phase in dogs the &quot;teenage&quot; phase.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This is so they can challenge for their place in their social hierarchy and tends to die down as they mature. </p>
<p>From what I remember from my biology courses, this is pretty common in animals that group and have a social hierarchy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
