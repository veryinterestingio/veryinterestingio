		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, insects. You may be thinking of the massive invertebrates of the Carboniferous Period, 300 million years ago. The marquee species are the massive millipede <a href="http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/a/arthropleura.html" target="_blank">Arthropleura</a>, the huge dragonfly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meganeura" target="_blank">Meganeura</a>, and the pants-shittingly giant sea scorpion <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaekelopterus" target="_blank">Jaekelopterus</a>. </p>
<p>The accepted wisdom for a long time is that the atmosphere was saturated with oxygen, and these animals died out when they couldn't passively absorb enough oxygen through their respiratory tubes. However, we know now that insects do force air in and out of their trachae (although I don't think anyone can tell you for a fact how or what effect that has over passive respiration), and we have found giant meganeurids dating from the relatively oxygen-poor Permian, so the story is likely a little more complicated- lack of predators, shifts in food supply, etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>False premise</p>
<p>Birds in the mesozoic were generally small and the largest known mesozoic bird is <em>Gargantuavis</em>, roughly the size of an emu. By far most were much smaller, and the largest mesozoic flying bird were \~2 m wingspan enantiornithines, which only occur in the latest cretaceous and were rare as far as we know.</p>
<p>Insects in the mesozoic weren't generally bigger than today. Titanopterans thrived a bit in the middle Triassic and those were certainly impressive, but the middle Triassic actually had <em>LOW</em> oxygen levels, so don't let people tell you this is because of a strong relationship between oxygen and insect size <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236984356_Rising_oxygen_levels_in_the_Late_Triassic_geological_and_evolutionary_evidence" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236984356\_Rising\_oxygen\_levels\_in\_the\_Late\_Triassic\_geological\_and\_evolutionary\_evidence" target="_blank">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236984356\_Rising\_oxygen\_levels\_in\_the\_Late\_Triassic\_geological\_and\_evolutionary\_evidence</a></a> (Only the late triassic began gaining higher levels of Oxygen and the titanopterans reached large sizes before that). There were some decently large lacewing-like insects in the Middle Jurassic but not larger than the upper insect size limit you see today.</p>
<p>Fish weren't as a whole larger than they are today. There were some very impressive ones such as <em>Leedsichthys</em> but on a whole there is no evidence fishes on average were any larger.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That’s largely survivor bias, combined with media representation.  Fossils are <em>rare</em>.  The smaller the animal the less likely it is to leave a fossil, therefore there is a bias in the record for large organisms and those with heavy/thick bones/shells.  Add to that that it’s a far better story if it’s a giant predatory bird-frog rather than a small, normal brown bird the size of a finch with slightly different toe bones than we are used seeing, and the actual situation gets really skewed in the public view.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you mean the Paleozoic insects, which did reach very large sizes. Arthropods were the first to colonize land apart from plants, large ecological niches which only they could occupy may have driven the evolution of giant forms. The paleozoic also coincides with a period of elevated oxygen (all the plants not bring eaten by herbivores) which may have helped. The atmosphere was also thicker than today which may have made it easier to fly and support larger wing structures. Paleozoic dragonflies had wingspabs of up to a meter or more. Some millipedes may have been larger than 2meter and may flies with wingspabs of 30cm.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I tried to find a thread where this question fits, but no luck. </p>
<p>Would those giant ancient insects be just as gushy when they get squished as modern insects? I'm not into killing bugs or anything, just wondering if little goosh on little bug = big goosh on big bug. </p>
<p>Also, how dense and difficult to break would their exoskeletons be? Would it be like a Creme brulee crust, or more like concrete? </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
