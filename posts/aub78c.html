		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On an ELI5 level...</p>
<p>Conjoined twins are two separate people who are connected by a shared body part or parts, or by connective tissues.</p>
<p>If one of the two twins should die while they are conjoined, the options for the other twin depends upon why the first died, and what parts of their bodies are connected.</p>
<p>For example, two conjoined twins may be joined at the top of their heads with a shared blood supply. It may have been too risky to separate them. </p>
<p>So let's say they were adults and were crossing the street and a car hit them. One was horrifically injured, crushed. The other was not directly injured.</p>
<p>Because they are connected with joint blood supply, the death of one will definitely lead to the death of the other. Because they were only joined by the connected vessels on their head, the safest thing to do is to now do surgery to separate them.</p>
<p>This is only one example. The situation can be quite complex. There may be a situation where they both share a common organ and they cannot live separately. In that case, the death of one (heart attack, old age, stroke, etc.) will lead to the unfortunate death of the other, either immediately or within hours.</p>
<p>As you could likely imagine, that is quite a horrific situation - the person you've been with every moment of your life is now dead and you face certain death within hours or days.</p>
<p>Today, the practice is to separate conjoined twins at a very young age if at all possible. That greatly reduces the chances of this type of situation. But it is not always possible if they share too many vital organs.</p>
<p>Historically, there are famous cases like Chang and Eng Bunker. They were connected at the sternum, and lived famous lives, married, etc. Chang died in his sleep. Eng woke up to find his brother died in sleep, and Eng passed away distraught about three hours later, likely due to the poisons developing in his brother's body (&quot;sepsis&quot;). Today, we believe they were joined by relatively simple cartilage and a few blood vessels and could be safely separated after birth using modern medical techniques.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every case of Siamese twins are different. So you can not say anything generic about this. They share different organs and their blood circulation is connected differently. So it is up to the doctors and the patients or their next of kin to select the best approach in every serious situation. It is possible that Siamese twins that were not separated before as it was risky or impossible would be able to choose this option if things change. However as Siamese twins are so connected it is often the case that whatever kills one of them also kills the other one within a short time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Daisy and Violet Hilton were conjoined twins stars in the Vaudeville era. After they fell from fame they started working at a grocery store as a cashier. They didn’t show up for shifts and when they looked to investigate, they found them dead. Daisy died between 2-4 days before Violet. Violet couldn’t drag Daisy’s body to the phone to call for help. Very tragic story.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The primary concern is blood flow and sepsis (infection). In most cases, blood flow passes to each other at the connection. When one dies, the blood stops, and the living twin will lose blood to the deceased twin, as well as receive &quot;stale&quot; blood from the deceased. Inevitably, the other dies from the complication. Blood infections are very serious, even if you are not a Conjoined Twin. A surgeon would have to near immediately remove the deceased twin, and hope above hopes that not only are there no complications from the death, but that the living twin's systems can handle the shock of removal.</p>
<p>And please use Conjoined Twins. Siamese is not a pleasant term to refer to this situation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
