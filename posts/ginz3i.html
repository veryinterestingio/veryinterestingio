<p>Lots of articles talk about how polar caps are important for reflecting incoming sunlight back into space. I was wondering how some of the technologies and materials we place outside affect the net thermal energy captured by the planet.</p>
<p>So controlling other variables (weather, greenhouse gases, etc.) what impact do these types of materials have on warming the planet? In the extreme, would a planet completely covered in solar panels be a different temperature than one that does not?</p>
<p>Edit: Thank you everyone for your detailed and informative responses! Tons of great information and additional topics to research. I hope others found this interesting as well.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great question.   Solar panels are quite absorbing (of course), so they have a low &quot;albedo&quot;, ie low reflectance of sunlight back to outer space.   The energy they absorb, unlike the blacktop of a parking lot, gets used for useful things like powering my laptop, but ultimately does get dissipated as heat on the earth's surface, because all the energy my laptop uses really just turns into heat.</p>
<p>That's not to say that solar panels are a bad thing;  plenty of the earth's surface (blacktop, water, etc) is low albedo, so if you build solar farms on top of those you've got an immediate win.   And of course if the alternative power source is fossil fuels and emits CO2, then you're avoiding the effect of that.  <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/solar-at-home/the-albedo-effect/" target="_blank">This scientific american article</a> estimates the breakeven, in terms of climate forcing comparing the albedo of your solar panels to the gain from avoiding CO2 emissions, to break even at 3 years of solar panel use.</p>
<p>But getting to your final question, yes, a planet with all its land and ice areas covered in solar panels would be hotter than one with them not covered, but not as hot as one that used fossil fuels to generate the same electricity as that &quot;solar panel covered&quot; world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are correct, solar cells do get a bit cooler (well, less hot at least) when they are in use!</p>
<p>The other comments do a great job explaining the physical reasons for this, but I wanted to chime in with a practical use for this effect: when you have a roof full of solar panels and you suspect at least one of them isn't functioning correctly, a quick way to test this is to look at the panels with an infrared camera. If any panels are malfunctioning, they will be hotter than the ones that are working correctly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm an electrical engineer with some background in semiconductors and have worked on many solar farms (primarily the HV systems, but you pick up details about the panels as you go).</p>
<p>Most commercial panels are very thin, literally just an aluminium frame around 2 sheets of glass with some silicon and wiring inside it, with a small box on the back to connect to the supply or daisy-chain up with other panels. They're fairly translucent, so they will allow a lot of light to transfer through. Some have a slightly opaque backboard but you can still see light though it. There's talk of new designs that absorb on both sides, to catch light reflecting back up off the ground - there are probably even some of these out there in the wild already.</p>
<p>From a semiconductor physics side of it, a silicon p-n junction will only absorb wavelengths of between about 400-1100nm. Wavelengths longer than 1100nm, that is most of the infra red spectrum, are transparent to the material. Thus most of the heating effect will pass through to the ground. </p>
<p>Ultimately, conservation of energy demands that whatever energy is absorbed by the panels will be lost to the ground beneath it. However, there is something to be said for the wind-shielding effect of the panels - the bulk of the prevailing winds across the field will now hit the panels, leaving the air underneath a little more stagnant.</p>
<p>Overheating is a big problem with solar panels, for a start the efficiency of solar panels reduces the hotter they get, but more significantly the wiring can overheat and catch fire on particularly hot days. Much of this is due to poor design - a lot of solar farms were thrown up by the cheapest teams available, many of whom didn't really know what they were doing. Some of it is down to the fact that the solar farm industry was relatively young, it's now a bit more mature so those in the industry know what's required and things to look out for in new builds.</p>
<p>Grass will happily grow underneath solar panels. In fact, many land owners with solar farms let their sheep graze inside the fence rather than having it mowed. Got to make sure all the cabling is tucked out of the way, though, as they apparently like to chew through the DC lines between the panels.</p>
<p>Edit: Just noticed your final question, in terms of warming the planet the effect will be little if any. The total amount of reflective area in a solar farm is relatively very small on the scale of almost any geological feature.</p>
<p>If you took it all the way to the extreme, with a planet almost or even completely covered in solar panels, there might be some temperature difference due to the reflection of the panels. I'd imagine they'd still be less reflective per m^2 than polar ice, however. The exact overall difference would depend on how reflective the panels are compared to the original ground and ice (they're perhaps more reflective than most of the ground, less reflective than ice), and the proportion of ice coverage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
