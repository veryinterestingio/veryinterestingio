		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no universally agreed on scientific answer, but the best theory I've heard is that lactose has a different permeability (ability to go through the various types of membranes/walls that surround cells and exist in cells themselves).</p>
<p>This difference in their ability to go through membranes allows for:<br />
a. A more easy-flowing and water-rich liquid.</p>
<p>b. Less complicated breast tissue (it's less complicated to evolve milk-producing structures than it would be to create cells that can store and secrete glucose fluid).</p>
<p>c. Because of the nature of lactose this allows it to be stored in a safer way, so that it's easier for the immune system to keep out bad bacteria while still being able to produce (and excrete) quite large amounts of fluid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Possible that it is similar to the same reason plants do not use glucose. Glucose and most other monosaccharides are chemically reactive due to their terminal carboxygens, known as &quot;reducing sugars&quot;. When you stick two of them together like lactose in mammals or sucrose in plants, those ends are stuck to each other and it's much more chemically stable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ah yes, that fateful day in every proud parent's life when their 5 year old finally asks about the purpose of various sugars in the metabolic process. Just tugs at the heart strings. :')</p>
<p>Sadly there's not really a concrete answer to this that I'm aware of. However, one benefit of diversifying sugars is to maximize nutritional benefit. By utilizing galactose as well as glucose you have multiple potential sources for glucose should one fail or be insufficient. It also metabolizes slower due to being slightly more complex. It's possible that the process of lactase breaking down lactose could be developmentally beneficial for the pancreas and liver.</p>
<p>Or it might just be a complete accident that serves no real purpose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My ELI5: momma mammals make milk with a special sugar that only babies can use as food.  This happened because all the momma mammals that didn’t use this special kind of sugar either got all the milk used for people who weren’t babies, or eaten by bad little bugs.</p>
<p>Sidenote: what a cool question to pose to students new to evolution!  It’s in the same vein as, “why doesn’t milk turn to bone if the calcium is so high?”</p>
<p>Sidenote 2: mammals are weird!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
