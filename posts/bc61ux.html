		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Non-permanent markers differ from the permanent ones due to them being mixed in with a polymer that acts as a buffer between the marker &quot;ink&quot; and the surface they are applied to.</p>
<p>That polymer doesn't stick to the surface or dry as easily as the &quot;ink&quot; would, thus allowing you to wipe it away.</p>
<p>EDIT: Another interesting thing about the difference between the two is that the non-permanent markers are better for coloring or drawing on paper or similar material, they coat the paper better and don't leave uneven color or streaks like permanent markers do. This one is a courtesy of my SO, she is into art and told me this fact when we discussed this exact topic in the past.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Found an article that explains a bit more:</p>

<p>And this related topic could be of interest to you as well (removing permanent marker ink with a dry erase marker) :</p>

Permanent markers use inks that are not soluble in polar solvents like water, so it doesnt wash off with water. But those inks are usually still soluble in acetone or ethanol</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Markers like sharpies typicaly have a solvent in them (toluene, Xylene)</p>
<p>Solvents have an evaporation rate that is favorable for markers because it helps keep the &quot;ink&quot; in liquid form until it evaporates off and dries.</p>
<p>It is very similar to paint. Heating up the &quot;ink&quot; will help bake it to just about any surface, as you heat up the mixture, the solvent evaporates quicker, forcing the structure of the &quot;ink&quot; to harden.</p>
<p>Cohesion also plays a big factor, some solvents act like water in a sense they can be polar.</p>
<p>I make Industrial paint for a living.</p>
<p>EDIT: Alot of big markers and e aerosols (Spray paint) do not feature Xylene or toluene anymore because that is the solvent people use to &quot;get high&quot; when they huff paint or markers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some good answers here.</p>
<p>It all has to do with the pigment being used. The molecular bonds and viscosity of it when the solvent dries off.</p>
<p>Sharpies and Dry Erase Markers (Not the Low Odor ones though.) both use EDIT: Alcohols as a solvent, 1-Propanol is most common I found and can replace the others.</p>
<p>What differs is the pigment used. Dry erase markers use a pigment that does not bond well and lies on the surface of what they mark. Making it easy to wipe off. Sharpes on the other hand bond together better and also will seep into what they are written on to form a tighter bond. This is why when you mark with a sharpie on a piece of paper it will go through the paper. Now some products like metal or solid plastics the sharpie ink will not readily penetrate, some of these you can just rub off, some though has slight penetration and the bonds of the pigment to each other makes it still permanent.</p>
<p>The fact that both sharpies and Dry Erase (Not the low odor ones) use 1-Propanol is why you can take a Dry Erase and go over a sharpie mark and erase it. The 1-Propanol will dissolve the pigment again and will mix with the Dry Erase Pigment and you can wipe it off.</p>
<p>I also keep around a bottle of 1-Propanol also called n-propanol and n-propyl Alcohol.</p>
<p>For two reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>Sharpes and Dry Erase tend to dry out pretty quick and a small injection of 1-Propanol will reactivate them. It is cost efficient but it is not being about cheap.It is about being able to use the Marker when you need to. You don't grab a Permanent Marker or Dry Erase too often so a lot of times when you do need them it has a good chance of being dry. You can't just have a backup on hand as they will dry up too. Having the 1-Propanol on hand means that I can grab the  Marker and if it has dried out I don't have to wait or go out to a store immediately and buy a new one. inject some 1-Propanol in the marker wait 10 minutes and use.</li>
</ol>
<p>Second is that if you douse a paper towel with 1-Propanol you can go over a sharpie mark on plastic metal or glass and it will remove it as it will dissolve the pigment again and be taken up by the paper towel which will absorb it which the dissolved pigment likes better than sitting on a non absorbent surface. Same principle of the Dry Erase to do that but quicker.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
