		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer - our big stupid brains</p>
<p>Longer answer - It is the price we pay for being significantly smarter than pretty much everything on this ball of rock and mud.  We evolved to have large brains, but also be bipedal.  So women are stuck pushing out something fairly large (the human brain) through a relatively narrow opening (their hips).  </p>
<p>Humans spend about as long as they can in the womb to develop as much as possible but we have to get them out before they are even finished growing because if they stay in there much longer they'll kill the mother on the way out.  That is why babies are so useless when they pop out - they are basically half formed.  The brain and organs are functional, but we have an enormous amount of post birth development to get there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At least some animals have an even more difficult time with childbirth. Spotted hyenas come to mind. The common thread is that natural selection has pushed both hyenas and us towards a trade-off that balances offspring survival with mom’s survival. The details of that trade off may have to do with offspring size, mother size, social system offspring find themselves in... you know, ecology stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have correctly mentioned big dumb brains being part of it. But another thing is our aggressive placenta. There are only a handful of other mammals with placenta like us, and conversely they experience menses as well. The placenta of humans drains a lot more out of us than with other animals and has an aggressive response to our immune system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just studied this in Embryology!</p>
<p>There are two types of placenta in mammals: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Deciduous placenta:
In this type the cells of the uterus participate in formation of the placenta by being a part of it and establishing a strong intimate connection with the embryo; so when it’s time to leave the uterus in childbirth, it’s more hurtful and painful because you’re literally ripping off the child from the wall of the uterus which causes hemorrhage, damage the uterus and other painful conditions. Which is the case in Humans. </p>
</li>
<li>Non-deciduous placenta:
Where the cells of the uterus don’t participate in placenta formation, the cells of the embryo just stick to the wall of the uterus; when it’s time to leave, it’s so easier to just slip through the uterus. In this case no hemorrhage or any damage to the uterus occurs! Which is the case in pigs and other mammals. </li>
</ol>
<p>Edit: Now to argue that the size of the fetus is the sole reason for this pain is completely wrong, because even when a procedure is carried (C-section) to deliver the baby from a cut in the abdomen, the mother also go through the whole conditions of hemorrhage and painful uterus damage. </p>
<p>Hope it helped.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
