		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I'm Dr. Cindy M.P. Duke, a Johns Hopkins and Yale-trained physician scientist and entrepreneur who's board certified in gynecology and obstetrics, and fellowship-trained in reproductive endocrinology and infertility (REI). I also have a PhD in virology. As America's only dual-accredited women's health fertility expert and virologist, I'm the physician founder and medical and lab director of the <a href="https://fertilitynevada.com/about-us-2/" target="_blank">Nevada Fertility Institute</a> in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.</p>
<p>My extracurricular work includes outreach to women and girls to encourage and foster their continued interest in careers in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). I'm the host and producer of the 'Girl Powered Success &amp; Survival International' aka <a href="https://gripssi.libsyn.com/" target="_blank">GriPSSI Podcast</a>, which is aimed at highlighting the work and dynamic career paths of women and girls around the globe. I'm also the producer of informative online programs aimed at debunking myths surrounding fertility and infertility among men and women in the diaspora and those within the LGBT community. I'm also actively creating and curating information about COVID-19 for the general public. Recently, Dr. Aimee and I were featured in the NOVA PBS documentary &quot;<a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/video/fighting-for-fertility/" target="_blank">Fighting for Fertility</a>,&quot; which premiered on May 12 and can be <a href="https://youtu.be/TqJ9sp1_Tsk" target="_blank">streamed on YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>As a Physician Executive, I've served on a number of hospital boards. I'm also a contributor and member of the Women's Health Advisory Council (WHAC) for <a href="https://www.healthywomen.org/" target="_blank">Healthywomen.org</a>, a Medical Advisor for Proov, a member of the Medical and Scientific Advisory board for CONFIRMD by Buddy Cheque, and a member of the Forbes Business Council. I'm also the current Leader of the Las Vegas Chapter of the Society of Physician Entrepreneurs. Throughout my career I've been - and continue to be - the beneficiary of many outstanding mentors and role models. As a result, outside of my clinical work and research, I understand the value of giving back to my community, which I view as the global village. My hobbies include gardening, photography, baking, and writing poetry.</p>
<p>Hi, Reddit! I'm <a href="https://draimee.org/about" target="_blank">Dr. Aimee Eyvazzadeh</a>, a fertility specialist with my own practice in the San Francisco Bay Area. I specialize in IVF and have vast experience helping women over 35 realize their dreams of becoming a mother.</p>
<p>I graduated from UCLA School of Medicine and completed my residency in Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology at Harvard Medical School. I also completed a fellowship in Reproductive Endocrinology &amp; Infertility and hold a Master's in Public Health Management and Policy from the University of Michigan.</p>
<p>A large part of my public health mission is to educate people about their fertility potential and remove the veil of mystery surrounding reproductive medicine and technologies. In the nearly 20 years since I completed my medical training in 2001, I've become well-known for my innovative approach to fertility care that begins with diagnosis before treatment. I've met many women in their 30s and 40s who have struggled with their fertility and wished they had known more about it when they were younger. In 2012, a patient inspired me to launch The Egg Whisperer, a three-step plan for fertility testing, consultation, and tracking. Then in 2014, I extended my mission to help educate and empower young people in their 20s and 30s about their fertility and better plan for their future families by starting her now well-known &quot;<a href="https://eggfreezingparty.com/" target="_blank">Egg Freezing Parties</a>&quot; in San Francisco. Fertility can be a heavy topic, so I wanted to create a lighthearted and fun approach to fertility education and understanding fertility preservation options.</p>
<p>We'll be here at 4 PM ET (20 UT), ask us anything about our work in fertility, involvement in STEM advocacy work, or our involvement with &quot;Fighting for Fertility&quot;!</p>

<p>Dr. Duke, can you talk about how you combine your expertise in virology and REI? Those seem like two very interesting but different fields!</p>
<p>Dr. Eyvazzadeh, you mention that a lot of women wish theyâ€™d had info on their fertility when they were younger. What sort of things should people know? What topics do you wish were discussed more?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
