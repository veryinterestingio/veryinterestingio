<p>&quot;Left/right&quot; has no physical sense or experience associated with it, ever.</p>
<p>With that in mind, do people with only one arm from birth confuse left/right less? I bet they do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Up and Down mean away from the earth / gravity pull and towards it.</p>
<p>Left and right have no such meaning.  There's nothing to distinguish left from right except a convention.</p>
<p>If you doubt this, try to explain what &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right&quot; mean with a definition that works in all instances, all headings, all locations.</p>
<p>It's like when you try to use &quot;up/down&quot; once in space... there is no up or down, and which one you choose to call which is largely arbitrary.</p>
<p>An alien would no more understand left/right than East/West or up/down out in space.</p>
<p>But at least when standing on a planet with a gravitational field, up/down have an obvious and measurable meaning for all viewpoints and all locations, and it's only determining the polarity of that direction (i.e. is up towards the gravity source or away?) that needs to be agreed on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We're bilaterally symmetric in left and right so if we draw a line from the top of our head downwards along our front, both sides are mirror images of each other for our visible, exterior parts.</p>
<p>Plus, the world is pretty symmetrical in left and right. Take a landscape photo and mirror it left to right. It's hard to tell which is correct unless you've visited that location. Now mirror the original up to down and it's pretty obvious it's upside down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
