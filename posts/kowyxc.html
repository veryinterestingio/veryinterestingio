		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Resolution (how many pixels you see) is not the only factor that determines video quality. Compression (how much information is lost in favor of smaller size) and related bitrate (how much information is displayed per second) is sometimes as much or even more important.</p>
<p>When you are watching 4K video on a 1080p display your computer is still using the high bitrate of the 4K video to play the file.</p>
<p>Some people also mentioned that many 1080p videos are not really 1080p because of how the particular codec (compression algorithm) works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, if we're talking streaming video here, when they encode the video for 1080p they'll compress it far more than they do the 4K one, simply because they can--people aren't going to notice loss of detail due to compression artifacts as easily on 1080p as they are 4K. So, the 4K video will have fewer such artifacts and will generally be higher quality.</p>
<p>Same applies on Youtube or the like--viewing a 1080p video on a 720p display will generally look better than viewing the same video at 720p on the same display.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another reason why video may look clearer - it is shot with a modern high end camera and is processed on a high end gear in highest resolution possible. The better the uncompressed master video is - the better the video will look even in compressed form when you stream it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>4K video looks better on 1080p display because theoretically that's what supposed to happen. </p>
<p>Images and Videos are down-sampled and compressed significantly because at end of the day it's all about how it looks to human eyes. If multifolds of reduction in size can be achieved by compromising few percentage in quantity, it is wise thing to do. </p>
<p>Each pixel in display has Red, Green and Blue LEDs. So each image need three distinct value of intensity of LEDs for each pixel. But these intensities of each pixel of Images and Videos are generally stored in three different variables called Y,Cb, and Cr. It is converted to intensities of RGB LEDs while displaying it on the screen. The reason to use three different variables is that human eyes are more sensitive to Y variables and less sensitive to Cb and Cr. So in most of the cases, each pixel has individual Y value but four adjacent pixels have the same Cb and Cr value. Again, the reason is to decrease the file size. </p>
<p>4K display has four times the pixels than 1080p. So while displaying 4K on 1080p, Along with Y, each pixel has separate Cb and Cr value as well. So Image or video seems more clearer.</p>
<p>We are obviously oversimplifying because compression and Codec of the video files are not considered. But this is the general theory behind observed improvement in video quality while displaying it on screen with lesser resolution.</p>
<p>TLDR; Images and Videos are down-sampled and compressed to reduce the file size while having some but not substantial compromise in quality. So while displaying them on screens with lesser resolution, effects of the down-sampling and compression reduces and quality is improved. But the improvement in quality is not that substantial and again it proves the legitimacy and ingenuity of down-sampling and compression methods.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I do video transcoding and rendering for a living. You see, 4K videos are filmed using 4K cameras with much more expensive low-noise sensors and usually a better lens. This improves 50% of the video quality that you watch. The 30% the quality improvement is the fact that you're playing the 4K video with higher bitrates than a 1080p video. Higher bitrates mean better quality, more colors and less pixelated motions.</p>
<p>Other Redditors touch on another real point on pixel format that videos are transcoded in. This is the last 20% of the quality improvement. Videos are transcoded with high emphasis on pixel brightness but not colors, so that they can compress the video size down by half or so. They call it chroma subsampling. Imagine the screen first showing a grayscale image of real 1080p pixels. But then they might paint only 540p worth of colors on top of it. It's 1080p but the colors seem to bleed out, making it a bit blurry. Now if you play 4K video, the player will decode into 1080p grayscale and then paint 1080p worth of colors on top of it, so you see everything in real resolutions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
