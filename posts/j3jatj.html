		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reposting my comment because autobot didn’t like one of my links. TL;DR at the bottom.</p>
<p>There are two types of pulp as described by the citrus processing industry — “sinking” (or “spindown”) and “floating.” Of course, lemons and limes will have both types. </p>
<p>Spindown pulp is made up of the smaller/finer pulp particles that will eventually form a sediment on their own since they are slightly more dense than the juice itself.</p>
<p>Floating pulp is made up of the course membrane material, or juice sacs, of the processed fruit. They are often removed from the juice product and washed to keep as much flavor in the product as possible, but they can also be added back into the juice in controlled amounts to fine-tune the “mouth feel” of the final product.</p>
<p>In addition to the actual pulp material, another contributing factor is the “juice cloud” that results from mashing up the fruits, and the cloud adds opacity and viscosity to the juice. It’s a colloidal mixture made up of proteins, pectin, and other things. There is a tightly-linked interplay between the suspended cloud material and the spindown pulp, with each one having a big effect on the other.</p>
<p>See chapter 7 of <a href="https://twin.sci-hub.se/6054/3fcd1e349258b4f561d3d0e78d67218a/kimball1991.pdf" target="_blank">this book</a> for a technical discussion on citrus pulp, and chapter 8 for a technical discussion of the juice cloud.</p>
<p><a href="https://dacemirror.sci-hub.se/journal-article/2087e475c5e213092bc7442744034d3b/rouse1978.pdf" target="_blank">This publication</a> and <a href="https://www.walltrac-itn.eu/content/download/3287/34113/version/2/file/Presentation-Journées+Scientifiques+VENAM+Oct+2012_Merve.pdf" target="_blank">this work</a> (see the results section) both show that limes were found to have the highest pectin content of all of the tested fruits. In addition, it’s well-known that limes are the most acidic of the citrus fruits.</p>
<p>From the Wiki on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pectin#Chemistry" target="_blank">pectin chemistry</a>, pectins are classified as high- vs. low-methoxy pectins (short HM-pectins vs. LM-pectins). HM-pectins are known to form a gel under acidic conditions in the presence of high sugar concentrations. LM-pectins can do the same, but in the presence of divalent cations.</p>
<p>From the results of <a href="https://cyber.sci-hub.se/MTAuMTAxNi9qLmZvb2RjaGVtLjIwMTguMTEuMDY3/rodsamran2019.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a>, we can see that lime pectins are classified as HM-pectin having a rapid-set gel formation.</p>
<p>So, given the high acidity of limes and the quantity/constitution of their pectins, we should expect a large degree of interplay between the juice cloud and the amount of spindown pulp. It’s also likely that the floating pulp of lime juice, compared to lemon juice, is simply removed and not re-added later given that lemon juice is the more commercially-accepted drink product (and we know from above that the amount of floating pulp is manually controlled since you can use it to tune for mouth feel). So I think, aside from the science and engineering, that the ultimate answer is that the floating pulp of limes is just not commercially desirable and is thus removed, giving you the impression that it is absent compared to lemon juice.</p>
<p>TL;DR — Sinking pulp and floating pulp are present in the manufacturing of both lemon juice and lime juice. Limes are more acidic and contain more pectins (including HM-pectins) relative to lemons, and the HM-pectins form a gel in a high acidity/high sugar environment. This effect impacts the behavior of the sinking pulp, likely leading to increased settlement in lime juice vs. lemon juice. Finally, the amount of floating pulp is highly controlled for mouth-feel, an important factor in the drinkable juices. Lemon juice is commercially more accepted as a drinkable juice compared to lime juice, so it’s likely that more of the floating pulp is added back in, adding to your perception of a difference between the behavior of the juices.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
