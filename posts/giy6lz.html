		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's down to what's at the other end of the space elevator, and where it is.</p>
<p>The tether would need to be attached to a satellite at geostationary orbit.  In this orbit, the satellite would remain directly over the same point on earth all the time.  And this orbit can only exist directly over the equator.</p>
<p>The tether, therefore, would also need to be attached at the equator, for two reasons:</p>
<p>- it's the shortest distance to the satellite</p>
<p>- if it's not on the equator and is, say, 100km North then the tether would be exerting a small sideways force on the satellite, trying to pull it out of the orbit a small bit.  If the satellite were to be pulled out of the geostationary orbit then it would enter a geosynchronous orbit -- it's still over the same line of longitude, but from a viewpoint on earth would move slightly north and south in the sky.  The tether isn't going to let it move south and remain at the same altitude, so it would then start to get out of sync with it's own orbit.  This wouldn't be good.</p>
<p>In short, if the tether was not on (or very close to) the equator then the satellite's orbit could become somewhat chaotic.</p>
<p>Having some boosters on the satellite would help, but only for so long.  Satellites in geostationary orbit still need to use boosters on occasion in order to fix their orbit if they start to wander.  But having to over fix it because of the tether would use up more fuel.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, the &quot;satellite&quot; here would be something massive anyway, like an asteroid -- nothing man made.  Also, in order to keep it in balance there would need to be something on the other side stretching out into space, with the same mass as the tether.  But these are just nitty-gritty details...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>lets take it to the extreme and go to the north pole. there, the forces acting on the elevator are:</p>
<p>- Gravity</p>
<p>And when we're at the equator, we've got </p>
<p>- Gravity</p>
<p>+ Centrifugal force from earths spin</p>
<p>So for that reason, the closer to the equator we are, the more balanced the two forces are and the less tension is on the majority of the structure.</p>
<p>Edit: stop telling me centrifugal force is not real. I don't care. It's a tool and it works. </p>
<p>Edit 2: people have given up on replying to this comment and are DM'ing me about it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If something orbits the earth it has to keep the center of the earth in the middle of the orbit. If it's at the equator it can stay over the same latitude. If it is at the right distance it can stay over the same point.</p>
<p>If it's going to be anywhere other than over the equator at any time it is going to have to be at a sloped angle compared to the Earth's rotation. It will then go north and South like the Sun does in the sky but much faster.</p>
<p>If you are suggesting having the cable at an angle that could add a 1000 miles to it's length and not only is that much harder but the orbit would be harder maintain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
