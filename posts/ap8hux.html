		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Body does; brain doesn't *enough*.</p>
<p>We're (well neurophysiologists and neuropsychlogists) still learning how important sleep really is. From things like deeply imprinting memories into long term memory (dreaming is likely a side effect of this process) and flushing out waste chemicals and replenishing the levels of others in your your brain. This is one of the reasons not sleeping can make you feel so crappy, it gets overwhelmed with waste products...also why insomnia can eventually be fatal. There's also likely numerous other processes we don't know about yet.</p>
<p>Every  day there's new discoveries about how important sleep is, Depression, Schizophrenia, Alzheimers, Heart disease, stroke are all associated with poor sleep (note associated, not caused by...it's super hard to define causation in this sort of thing).</p>
<p>However much we'd like to believe it, the brain isn't a computer, it needs constant maintenance to perform at an optimal level and sleep is when those critical processes are performed.  </p>
<p>For the NUMEROUS 'well my dreams mean something' comments...Sorry but modern psychology suggests dreams don't mean ANYTHING other than your brain is really good at  fleshing out random bits of information with stories (Gestalt)...they  may  *seem* to mean something as they're formed from your existing  memories...sorry!   </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it does rest,
it is important to lay still every once in a while and not be in a constant state of motion</p>
<p>but it doesn't accomplish ALL the biological functions that need to take place - and some of them depend on the body entering a sleep state</p>
<p>i'm not an expert on WHAT all of these functions are, what I can tell you is that the reason that the body &quot;requires&quot; a sleep state, is because otherwise it is implicitly &quot;assumed&quot; that your body needs to be ready at any moment to leap into action and start running or fighting or whatever.</p>
<p>Sleep basically &quot;shuts down&quot; (or lowers the intensity of) some of the systems which enable you to be so highly alert &amp; ready,  and initiates other systems and mechanisms which consume the now-available energy </p>
<p>in particular - your BRAIN has a lot of its systems &quot;shut down&quot; and this allows for greater expenditure of energy towards things like &quot;fixing&quot; your body - removing waste, repairing or replacing broken tissue, doing some long-term metabolism etc.</p>
<p>if your body were to do these things while awake, there wouldn't be enough energy to maintain proper brain function that is necessary for wakefulness</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>While awake throughout the day, you drain your battery. Resting doesn't drain so much battery, but it doesn't charge, either. Sleeping charges your battery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body might get some rest. Muscle fibers are certainly getting repaired and such, your eyes get a break from the constant light exposure they get throughout the day. Your brain, however, doesn't get any rest when you're still awake. Your brain activity is significantly higher while you're awake, even if you're not actively performing any mental tasks.</p>
<p>You still get sleepy at the end of the day even if you didn't move your body at all, after all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't shed any light on the mechanisms, but there are some pretty significant physiological differences when you're asleep.</p>
<ul>
<li>Heart rate and blood pressure drop</li>
<li>Body temperature drops</li>
<li>Blood contents change (sugar, oxygen, co2 levels etc.)</li>
<li>Brain activity changes
etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, your entire body is in a much different state just by being awake so it's not surprising that it can't perform all the &quot;recovery&quot; functions that are possible during a sleep state.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
