		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a large issue NASA has had to deal with. It is an international law that all spacecraft must be cleaned to avoid contamination. </p>
<p>They use a variety of compounds and radiation to kill microbes and bacteria but the unfortunate thing is some microbes are very, very hardy. Some bacteria love radiation and NASA even found that a bacteria was surviving in one of their clean rooms by consuming one of their own cleaning products. It is virtually impossible to remove all life from the surface of an object. </p>
<p>Current NASA standards are up to 300,000 spores from the exposed surface of a landed spacecraft and a maximum density of 300 spores/m^2. There are also zones on mars that are quarantined from all spacecraft and extraterrestrial life to avoid contamination.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a role in NASA called the Planetary Protection Officer (the job is actually going at the moment - <a href="https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/careers-employment/nasa-hq-planetary-protection-officer/" target="_blank"><a href="https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/careers-employment/nasa-hq-planetary-protection-officer/" target="_blank">https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/careers-employment/nasa-hq-planetary-protection-officer/</a></a>) who is responsible for minimising contamination for missions.  They oversee that all components on a spacecraft (literally every nut and bolt) are thoroughly sterilised according to NASAs guidelines (based on international law)</p>
<p>There is are several international treaties concerning the organic contamination of space which most countries space agencies follow strictly.  However, there is a growing concern that as more commercial flights are planned by private companies (or government agencies that do not follow the treaties as well as they could), that this could be a bigger risk as they may not follow them as stringently in order to save costs.   Already some steps are being taken to counteract this, such as Perseverance taking and storing samples (as excellently explained by u/The_RealKeyserSoze).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a very difficult problem, but one that scientists are acutely aware of as others have said.</p>
<p>No-one has yet mentioned this but its the primary reason the Cassini spacecraft was crashed into Saturn at the end of it's mission - along with the useful science data obtained about Saturn's internal structure - to avoid contaminating sites like Titan and Enceladus for future study.</p>
<p>> What if we do, and the microorganisms essentially become invasive species?</p>
<p>If life were found on another body in our solar system, perhaps the most straight forward reason why contamination would be a problem is in muddying the question of a single genesis of life. The possibility of Earth life overwhelming or at least altering another ecosystem is very real, but it would certainly confuse origins evidence. That is, if one could prove any life found was not brought from Earth in the first place, which is itself doubtful in the case of common origins. A totally different genesis of life would presumably be more easy to identify, once alien life was identified, but the real challenges would be if there are some similarities in that life - how would be know the difference between the same solutions to evolutionary problems appearing in two places versus common ancestors? Scientists would rather avoid this quagmire of confusion by doing everything they can to avoid contamination in the first place. Although there's no guarantee that Mars is not already contaminated by the several successful lander/rover missions.</p>
<p>> If thats the case, then how would we tell the difference between an  organism from Earth and an organism that had its origins on the  celestial body we’re studying?</p>
<p>Because we lack direct evidence of life's progenitors, we have to study the traces they left behind in the genome's of modern-day organisms, via 3-4 billion years of inheritance.  A key way these origin questions are studied is via genome analysis, bioinformatics or computational biology.</p>
<p>In recent years a significant part of this work has become a statistical and computational process as sequencing technology has improved. Basically you can take a bucket of water from a pond, and sequence all the genetic material in it, and classify that material by some taxonomy. Every time scientists do this they makes discoveries. You can do it at the organism level, but you can also do it at the gene level, and that's what biologists do. This can show interesting relationships between seemingly unrelated organisms and is used to reason about common ancestors or horizontal gene transfer.</p>
<p>Truly alien life - not based on RNA/DNA - would not be immediately recognisable to this technology, and it's hard to imagine general purpose instruments for detecting alien life of the like that could be attached to a rover. Certainly we can guess at signs of life, based on study of uniquely organic processes on Earth, and design those sorts of instruments, but ultimately retrieving samples for analysis in a fully-featured lab is the optimal strategy.</p>
<p>The first step to identify alien life would be chemical analysis and there are many techniques. Essentially complex molecules would be readily apparent, and it would go from there. A discovery of a new domain of life would immediately spark a huge field of study.</p>
<p>But a really interesting case would be if it *were* RNA or DNA based. Then genome analysis would provide fascinating insights into the history and genesis of that life, but probably also the history and genesis of life on Earth as well. For example, if the life shared any genes with some archaic form of Earth life, that would be huge. If the life were cellular, that would also have enormous implications. If the life were RNA or DNA like but no shared genes could be found, that would be equally massive.</p>
<p>No-one can really predict what would happen when alien life met Earth life, but it's bound to be dramatic for one or both forms. It's virtually guaranteed that parasitic life, such as viruses, would be first to take advantage of the new hosts, and some believe it's guaranteed that any form of life will host it's own parasitic forms. In my view the intersection of two distinct forms of life would spark a wave of evolution seen maybe only once or twice in Earth's history, and lasting tens of millions of years. It would ultimately result in hybrid forms of life that we can't imagine. Frankly it's not something you want to be happening on Earth, so I think in the future, the risk of returning exosamples to Earth will be one that comes up in the discussion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
