		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm Will Armentrout, an astronomer at the Green Bank Observatory (<a href="https://greenbankobservatory.org" target="_blank">https://greenbankobservatory.org</a>) in West Virginia. The Observatory is within the United States National Radio Quiet Zone, a 13,000 square mile area of the Appalachian mountains where radio transmissions are limited by federal and state law. These protections become more restrictive as you move closer to Green Bank, so since I live on observatory grounds, I go about my daily life with no cell phone, no microwave, no wifi, no wireless headphones...</p>
<p>The Green Bank Telescope (GBT) is the largest movable structure anywhere on land, sitting at 485 feet tall and 17 million pounds. The radio telescope has a diameter of 100 meters (~300 feet) -- you could easily fit two football fields on the telescope's surface. The GBT is used to observe a huge variety of astrophysical phenomena, from active star forming regions, to pulsars and fast radio bursts, to galaxies billions of light years away, and more.</p>
<p>My position involves a mix of my own scientific research and the chance to work with astronomers from across the world who want to use the GBT. I also coordinate our student research programs and observer training workshops. My scientific research focuses on how the Milky Way Galaxy conspires to produce high-mass star (masses greater than ~10 times that of our Sun). We use these high-mass star forming regions as probes for studying the structure of the Milky Way and how the environment around the Sun compares with other regions of our Galaxy. I'm particularly interested in an extremely distant spiral arm, known as the Outer Scutum-Centaurus Arms, which seems to be the outermost limit for high-mass star formation in our Galaxy about 20 kpc (or 70,000 light years) from the Earth.</p>
<p>I'm originally from Ford City, Pennsylvania and went to Ford City High School. I graduated from Westminster College in 2012 with a BS in Physics and finished my PhD in Physics at West Virginia University in 2018. I started a postdoctoral position at the Green Bank Observatory right after graduate school, and was hired onto the permanent scientific staff earlier this year. Outside of work, I keep busy hiking in the Appalachians, keeping track of a small flock chickens, and renovating a huge century old building in my hometown with my siblings (any leads on old planetarium equipment?).</p>
<p>I'll be on at 1 pm EDT (17 UT) on Wednesday, July 22nd, ask me anything!</p>
