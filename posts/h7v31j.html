<p>Your belly button is the artifact left behind of your umbilical cord. Once you are birthed, they snip the cord a few inches off the base. After a few days it drys up and falls off because no nutrients are being received. </p>
<p>The inside part of the cord is connected to the bladder, the gut, and the main vein that goes to the heart called the Vena Cava. Since your body has no need for those structures, they just get broken down by the body. Sometimes, they aren’t fully broken down and can cause a cyst or a full on opening such as a Meckel’s diverticulum or Patent Urachus. Usually these need to be closed or removed surgically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It connects to:
Your liver, via what's called the falciform ligament.  While you're still a fetus this is where arterial (oxygenated) blood comes in from Mom and venous (deoxygenated) blood from the fetus goes back to Mom.  Those vessels close off shortly after birth.  In most adults, this ends up as a cord-like structure, mostly fatty, that connects the bellybutton to the groove between the right and left lobes of the liver.  In people with cirrhosis, as the liver gets more scarred and the resistance to blood flow in veins increases, huge veins can open up inside this ligament, and eventually to the abdominal wall itself.  This is known as Caput Medusa.</p>
<p>Your bladder, via what are called the urachal ligaments.  This is how urine from the fetus is returned to Mom for excretion.  Again, these close off shortly after birth, and in adults are just these 2 cord-like structures that run from the bellybutton down to the bladder.  They don't do much of anything.  Rarely, these don't fully close off and you can develop a cyst (fluid-filled sac), at any point between the bladder and the belly button.  Very rarely, it doesn't close off at all and you can pee through your belly button, which I imagine would be a hit at parties.</p>
<p>A Meckel's diverticulum is a little different.  It results when a structure called the vitelline duct, which is only supposed to be around for the first 8 weeks or so in fetal development, fails to close.  This can result in a little pouch of tissue (kind of like a sock) that protrudes from the wall of the small intestine, usually within about 2 feet of where it connects to the large intestine.  These can bleed, perforate, get infected, or do nothing at all.  They don't connect to the belly button.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve done quick search for this, in short it forms into a bunch of ligaments inside the abdomen and remain inside it, a portion of it is connected to the lever while other portions of it just hang on the inside doing pretty much nothing. One portion of it also is connected to the bladder, the part responsible for urinating (kinda?) when a person was still a fetus.</p>
<p>Found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nP0PSrjDxoo" target="_blank">this video</a> taking about it, in its description there are more references as well. Cheers!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I asked the nurses the same question when my first kid was born in 2010, and they didn’t know. They came back to me a few hours later with a big huge medical encyclopedia. It had illustrations of how veins, arteries, food, waste, etc. moved through the belly and down into the liver.</p>
<p>Looking online even today, it is difficult to find information on it. I found <a href="https://www.journalofnaturalmedicine.com/what-is-the-belly-button-connected-to/" target="_blank">this article</a> that shows it okay.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
