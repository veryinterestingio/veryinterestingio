		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just curious if we know if/what changes may be permanent.  Obviously there are short term changes, or changes that take place while a person is actively taking antidepressants, but is there any evidence of changes beneficial, toxic, or otherwise from long term use that persist even after you stop?  Examples could be personality changes, enlargement or shrinking of brain structures, neurogenesis or neurotoxicity, whatever.</p>
<p>My understanding is that there are probably beneficial changes that come from relieving the physical stress on the brain caused by depression - anything else?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a very interesting topic that is extremely complex not well understood. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/mp201557" target="_blank">A 2016 study</a> of nearly 2000 individuals found that expression of 129 genes was significantly different between individuals with and without depression. People that had recovered from depression displayed a shift in gene expression towards the control (never depressed) group. Another <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3491115/" target="_blank">study</a> found that genes associated with synaptic function were also affected by depression. Research is now indicating that antidepressants are effective partly through indirectly impacting gene expression which should have lasting effects even after someone has stopped taking them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you are roughly on target that there may be some slight long term benefit from not being depressed. You can prevent long term damage by getting good nights sleep and not being on edge all the time. But you have to weigh this against any damage anti-depressants may have.</p>
<p>The tolerance mechanisms means that in the short term your body is usually more susceptible to depression when you stop treatment. Depending on the drug these changes to your body could be short term or long term.  Some anti-depressants often have effects that can easily last years other might be forever. Some may cause longer term changes in the brain. Some may damage receptors if used in high doses, withbad combinations or for long periods.</p>
<p>You also need to bear in mind how we are still kind of medieval ages when it comes to anti-depressants. If you are mentally ill, do we do a brain scan to check for any issues with the structure and how it reacts to control questions? Do we check your dopamine or serotonin levels? How do we select the correct treatment? How likely are you also to be on another pill to counter the side effects of the first. Most of your serotonin receptors are in your gut, what impact does the pill have on them? What impact do they have on your microbiome? What effect does your gut(neurons &amp; microbiome) have on depressions? Are there many studies on the long term impact of anti-depressants on the brain? I think it's more than reasonable to be cautious about negative long term effects of anti-depressants. The gold standard to treating depression on the long term is simply a good diet and regular exercise. If you need pills in the short terms that fine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have always had depression issues but atypical symptoms and have struggled to find a medication that does anything beneficial. I tried lexapro 15 years ago and it worked I started to take care of some issues that I had been neglecting and this meant doing 10 days in the county jail. Even though they had told me medication would not be a problem it was, they refused to give me the lexapro and I went into withdrawal. even now <strong>15 years later</strong> I experience rare shocks like a jolt from my brain to my extremities. the worst part was that the lexapro stopped working when I went back on... I found an alternative solution for the majority of my symptoms that aren't improved by exercise but am still a bit salty at pima county for deceiving me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
