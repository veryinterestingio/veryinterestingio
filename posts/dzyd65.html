There is only two companies in the US that we get flims from that I know of. Those hard drives can have multiple versions of the movie on them ranging from your standard 2D to 3D and also 5.1 sound and 7.1 sound. I've seen one hard drive for a kids movie contain 10 versions the movie. I've seen some movies take 200 GBs of hard drive space. Just a little bit of info from my experience working at a theater.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>TLDR</strong> VERY large digital files   </p>
<p>A <strong>Digital Cinema Package</strong> (<strong>DCP</strong>) is a collection of digital files used to store and convey <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_cinema" target="_blank">digital cinema</a> (DC) audio, image, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_stream" target="_blank">data streams</a>. </p>
<p>The term was popularized by Digital Cinema Initiatives, LLC in its original recommendation<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Cinema_Package#cite_note-1" target="_blank">[1]</a>  for packaging DC contents. However, the industry tends to apply the  term to the structure more formally known as the Composition.  (&quot;You  PLAY a Composition, You do NOT play a Digital Cinema Package&quot;.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Cinema_Package#cite_note-2" target="_blank">[2]</a>) A DCP is a “packing crate” for Compositions,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Cinema_Package#cite_note-Cinepedia-3" target="_blank">[3]</a>  a hierarchical file structure that represents a title version. The DCP  may carry a partial Composition (e.g. not a complete set of files), a  single complete Composition, or multiple and complete Compositions.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Cinema_Package#cite_note-Cinepedia-3" target="_blank">[3]</a> </p>
<p>The Composition consists of a Composition Playlist (in XML  format) that defines the playback sequence of a set of Track Files.  Track Files carry the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essence_(media)" target="_blank">essence</a>, which is wrapped using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_Exchange_Format" target="_blank">Material eXchange Format</a> (MXF). Two track files at a minimum must be present in every Composition (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Motion_Picture_and_Television_Engineers" target="_blank">SMPTE</a> ST429-2 D-Cinema Packaging - DCP Constraints, or Cinepedia<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Cinema_Package#cite_note-4" target="_blank">[4]</a>):   a track file carrying picture essence, and a track file carrying audio  essence. The Composition, consisting of a Composition Playlist and  associated track files, are distributed as a Digital Cinema Package  (DCP).  It must be underscored that a Composition is a complete  representation of a title version, while the DCP need not carry a full  Composition.  However, as already noted, it is commonplace in the  industry to discuss the title in terms of a DCP, as that is the  deliverable to the cinema. </p>
<p><strong>The Picture Track File essence is compressed using</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_2000" target="_blank"><strong>JPEG 2000</strong></a> <strong>and the Audio Track File carries a 24-bit linear</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation" target="_blank"><strong>PCM</strong></a>  <strong>uncompressed multichannel WAV file.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Movies - DCP (Digital Cinema Package) on a hard drive. Usually a CRU - a specific drive housing that fits into a dock on the server, but smaller distributors often send them on a typical USB drive that you can buy at OfficeWorks.</p>
<p>Trailers - DCP on a USB stick, and increasingly becoming available either from cloud storage services, or automatic digital delivery systems.</p>
<p>Both of these, you copy onto a server, which you can then use to make up a playlist. For example, opening tags, ads, trailers, movie. You can also attach automation cues at various points on the playlist, for curtains, masking, lights, etc.</p>
<p>From there, you schedule the playlist to play over the course of the week at the correct times. Then you can pretty much just sit back and let them do their thing.</p>
<p>Film is still a thing in a few rare circumstances. Mainly with older movies at cinemas who care about the format, but occasionally new releases too, in the right circumstances. Joker received a 70mm release here, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood received a 35mm release here, etc. I’m pretty passionate about film, so I run film using traditional techniques in private theatre in my spare time, and am in the process of reinstalling film projection equipment at my cinema.</p>
<p>Happy to answer any further questions about any of it. Talking about this stuff makes me happy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I own a drive-in theatre here in Tennessee.  While its a &quot;drive-in&quot;, what we have in the projection booth is identical to our indoor counterparts with the exception of the sound processors.   We converted from 35mm to digital projection in March of 2013.  We have two screens, and our projection booths are identically equipped with Barco DP2K-23B projectors, GDC SX2000AR servers, and USL JSD-60 sound processors.  These 3 components are the heart of our projection systems.</p>
<p>Our GDC servers have a removable CRU sled drive slot that we previously used to ingest the movies from the studios.  The hard drives for the movies would come in on a CRU removable hard drive (shipped either by UPS or FedEx) and the content on the hard drives are encrypted.   We would take the hard drive, insert it into the projection server CRU slot and copy the DCP package for the movie onto the projection server.   The way our system is setup, we have an IMB (Internal Media Block) that is installed in the side of the projector that &quot;decrypts&quot; the movie files &quot;on the fly&quot;.   The movie files as they are stored on the hard drives are encrypted.  The movie files as they reside on the server are encrypted.  The digital pathway between the server and projector is encrypted.   The actual &quot;decryption&quot; takes place inside the projector in real time as the movie is being played.   There is no way for us to watch the movie on a video monitor.  The only way we can watch a movie is out the front of the projector on the screen.</p>
<p>The &quot;decryption keys&quot; for the movies are sent out by the studios usually 2-3 days before we are scheduled to play the movie.  The decryption keys are written specifically for our theatre.  They are coded in such a way that they are only specific to our server and IMB with its own unique serial number.  They are also time coded and date coded as well.  A typical key will be coded for the specific movie file, in the specific format compatible with our specific hardware ( Closed Captioned, Open Captioned, 5.1 stereo sound, 7.1 stereo sound, Dolby ATMOS, 3D, Laser, etc.), and the decryption key will only be valid for X number of days, beginning at a specified time of day and ending at a specified time of day.</p>
<p>With all of that being said, we no longer use removable CRU sled drives at our theatre.  In May of 2018, we installed a DCDC satellite delivery system.   Now all of our movie files, trailers, etc. come in via satellite and are stored on a big mass storage NAS which currently sits in our Screen 2 projection room.   The satellite downloads all of our media content and stores it on a Kencast server.   The Kencast server is tied in to our &quot;Projection Media Network&quot; which is accessible to both projection rooms.   It is my understanding that the satellite downloads EVERYTHING available from the studios in current release, but only the film titles we have currently booked are visible to us on our end.   When we book a title, we will receive an email from the studios a day or two later that lets us know that the title has been published to our satellite server and is available to ingest on to our projection servers.   I simply go to the projection server and using the touch screen monitor on the rack, I navigate the ingest point to the DCDC server and copy the files on to the specific projection server.    Once that's completed (takes about 10-15 minutes), I check my email and download the decryption keys on to a thumbdrive and copy them on to the projection server and IMB.</p>
<p>The projection server IS the playback device.   When I build a show, I choose which policy trailers to use, which movie trailers to use, and arrange the order of the content how I want it to play.  Once I build the playlist and insert our automation cues, I schedule the playlist to start at a specified time on the specific days we are playing it.   If we try to run the playlist anytime outside of the active window of the decryption keys, the only thing that will play is the policy trailers and movie preview trailers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Cinemark would transport film reels by ground Thursday night to be 'built up' for showings the following day. When I was leaving, they were transitioning to digital. At the time, they sent flashdrives with the movie loaded and some trailers. Plug it in an set the timer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
