How does this not cause problems when it enters the blood stream? Do needles not work that way?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In some ways it's better to think of a needle as a knife, not a punch. It has a beveled end, and a newly uncapped needle is <strong>sharp</strong>. In fact, in surgeries we sometimes use small (e.g. 30ga) needles as microknives, just to cut something without ever intending to punch into it.</p>
<p>So ideally the needle splits the skin and enters the desired tissue &quot;clean&quot;. You can also help this process, when necessary, by applying slight positive pressure to the syringe that is on the back end of the needle; this pushes material away and stops anything from plugging the tip. This technique is used, for example, in a related kind of procedure called whole-cell recording (where the &quot;needle&quot; is actually a pulled glass pipette, with a subcellular sized tip).</p>
<p>Edit: fixed minor typos. Also, it's worth mentioning that needles commonly are not bare metal, but have an ultrathin coating that reduces friction, thereby also lessening the chance of material getting stuck to the tip.</p>
<p>Also, while I'm on a roll, there can be a <em>huge</em> decrease in effectiveness after a needle is first used. They are not meant to be reused.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As you can see the angle of the hole in the needle means that the skin is pierced by the pointy bit before it ever really comes into contact with the hole.</p>

<p>Pierced. Therefore, not hole punched.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Needles like that are slanted, and only one part of that slanted needle is actually sharp. The other end is comparatively dull. So, the sharp part cuts a small slice in the skin, then the dull end just pushes it out of the way, like a flap. Imagine the hole as a U shape, but you are putting a rod through it. The rod will just move the U flap out of the way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So this is generally not a huge issue for needling vessels, when trying to make bigger holes or going through tougher tissues it can be a problem. In addition to positive pressure and needle tip design, for some procedures, such as spinal procedures you may well have an obturator, which is essentially something which fills the needle lumen to the tip to prevent this problem.</p>
<p>Even with such things, it still happens that tissue does block the orifice to the needle, or indeed blood does. It is super annoying. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
