<p>The professor had put up two pictures: One was the famous Song Dynasty paintingÂ Along the River During the Qingming Festival, full of fine, rich details; the other was a photograph of the sky on a sunny day, the deep blue expanse broken only by a wisp of a cloud ... The photograph's information content - its entropy- exceeded the painting's by one or two orders of magnitude.</p>
<p><em>Cixin Liu, The Three Body Problem (fiction)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I've attended some lectures on entropy, but not being a physicist and never having to apply the concept, the counterintuitive parts of it always just escape my brain's long-term comprehension.</p>
<p>Is this passage correct, and what's the explanation that someone with a PhD in a lowly subject like biology could follow?</p>
<p>(I've found <a href="https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/41592/does-a-simple-photograph-contain-more-information-than-a-complex-painting" target="_blank">this attempt at a discussion</a>, but the top explanation jumps straight to algebra, and none of the others are very fluent. Link also includes the painting in question.)</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mathematically, entropy is related to the amount of information I gain when I make small measurements of the system repeatedly.  If it is easy to gain information from repeated measurements, then the system has low entropy (it isn't that complicated to understand how it is built from it's parts).  If it is difficult to do this, it has high entropy.</p>
<p>If I take two small samples from the painting, due to the high level of detail, it should be trivial for me to determine whether or not they are adjacent in the painting.  This is far more difficult for the picture of blank sky.</p>
<p>Note that a pure blue (single tone) picture made in say, MS paint with auto fill has very low entropy, because any two small pieces that are the same shape <em>will be the same information</em> and hence you will readily identify them as the same (every time I look at this I see the same thing - this picture is just blue #325).  With the blue sky, there is subtle, random variation in color tone that makes it complex.</p>
<p>It may also help to note that an image having exactly 200 different colors and shades across the spectrum is not more complicated than an image that contains 201 different shades of blue painted in the same way.  Different shades are different colors in a formal <em>wavelength of light</em> sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As another biology PhD (hey! Don't sell us short!), my first suspicion is that this has olfactory cues suggestive of  adult bovine fecal matter.</p>
<p>Maybe the blue sky picture has more information in the sense of more pixels of different value. However, this trivial possible point is dwarfed by what it says about the definition of information and information value. </p>
<p>A picture of eight-bit Mario conveys more information to a human brain than a HD picture of blue sky where most of the pixels could be switched around and it would still tell our monkey brain &quot;that's a blue sky&quot;. </p>
<p>So if anything it displays the difference between information value and information content. But in what seems like a poor way unless it came with more explanation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think I know what he was getting at (not that I agree completely or partially).</p>
<p>The definition of entropy is not well understood or even entirely agreed upon in all contexts by most people. You seem to have (or the professor has) connected it directly to information content, which isn't really a holistic definition unless you have an extremely strong understanding of what information means in physics.</p>
<p>Entropy, in one sense (and one I prefer for basic explanations), can be thought of as an measure of the likelihood of a system being in that state (thus, it increases as the universe trends towards its most likely state over essentially infinite &quot;random&quot; interactions, although technically it's probably a closed system with an unchanging overall entropy). I think this is what the professor is getting at; one contains many &quot;random&quot; details distributed somewhat evenly and the other is extremely &quot;ordered&quot;.</p>
<p>It's not a great analogy imo, but it does succeed in challenging preconceived notions about entropy, which is very important. It's most applicable to the most basic systems (gas diffusing in a space, for example). A mixed system has higher entropy than a system where all the blue particles are bunched up. Like I said, pretty basic silly analogy.</p>
<p>Either that or he's getting into information content vs information value, which he might have a stronger point on but isn't equivalent to greater entropy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can only think of two reasons the sky might have more entropy then the painting.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>First, the painting, being a painting and not a photograph might have fewer unique colors within it. There painting is detailed, but has only a few shades that likely have a smaller gradient range. The sky has only blue... but it might be more finely graduated such that there are more shades of blue in the sky then shades of color in the painting.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Second, the painting includes structures that have definite shape... the building, benches, and all those things... while the sky has no definite shapes. In the painting any pixel within a definite object is much more likely to be similiar to surrounding pixels then in the sky... in the sky a cloud can start or stop on any pixel.. clouds have no definite shape so there is no relation between nearby pixels.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So, in the end... the sky might have more unique colors with less object similarity between pixels then the painting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<blockquote>
<p>The photograph's information content - its entropy</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)" target="_blank">Information-theoretic entropy</a> is the expected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_content" target="_blank">surprisal</a>.  The surprisal is the information content (the negative log probability) of an events.  A photograph is an outcome, which is possibly an event.</p>
<p>You cannot have a surprisal without a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_space" target="_blank">probability space</a>, which includes a mapping from events to probabilities.  In this case, you need a statistical model that maps photographs to probabilities.  Absent a model, the surprisal of any two photographs (with the same size and colors depth) is equal.</p>
<p>If you have a great model of what blue skies look like, then a photograph of a blue sky can have low surprisal.  If you have a great model of paintings, then photographs of those can have low surprisal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
