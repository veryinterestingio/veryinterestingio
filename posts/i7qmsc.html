		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The music of the most accomplished 18th century (to early 19th century in Beethoven's case) composers have stood the test of time and are still highly regarded 200+ years later. </p>
<p>If in 200+ years, if people are still listening to Johannson or Goransson (or The Beatles or Beyonc√© or whatever), then they'll get lumped in with historical greats like Bach or Beethoven. </p>
<p>Remember there were a LOT of composers from Bach and Beethoven's time that are totally forgotten because their music didn't stand the test of time. </p>
<p>Also, music evolves. Orchestral music isn't popular as it was 200-250 years ago. Heck, it's not even as popular as it was 75 years ago. Most people only hear it as background music in films (which is where Johannson and Goransson have done most of their work), and don't listen to it <em>by itself</em> for pleasure. So it's less likely to get recognition outside of a small market. </p>
<p>Frankly, Goransson is more likely to go down in history for producing Childish Gambino's &quot;This is America&quot; and other songs, than as an orchestral composer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quality is subjective, but fame isn't, and what's popular changes over time. </p>
<p>Beethoven and Bach became famous by composing types of music that is no longer popular. You won't hear a sonata on the top 40 countdown (if those even still exist? I'm old). In 2020, no matter how much skill you have, composing orchestral music will not make you famous like Kanye. </p>
<p>The &quot;best&quot; jazz trumpeter ever might be playing now, but they'll never be as famous as Louis Armstrong or Miles Davis. The &quot;best&quot; psychedelic/prog rock band ever might be playing now, but they'll never be as famous as Pink Floyd.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, they are not only good, they were brilliant groundbreaking innovators too (Beethoven more than Bach imo)! </p>
<p>And I think some modern composers are quite highly regarded today, albeit in smaller circle, esp. people like Pierre Henry, Pierre Boulez, Arvo Part, Schaeffer, Xenakis, Stockhausen, Rautavaara... </p>
<p>And well, Bach hasn't always been as popular as today, maybe Johann Johannson will become popular when he will be rediscovered in the next millenium :D but to be honest, I'm not sure he's as revolutionnary as Mozart or Beethoven were in their own time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Music is subjective, but in all art I think public consensus says whoever did it first did it best. New composers usually have a samey sound because a lot of it is used for movie scores and most movies are also kind of samey in tone and visual. Then you have modern composers like John Williams, who I'm pretty sure has taught his music to more people than Beethoven or Bach thanks to the popularity of Star Wars. His music is very well composed, but it is popular because of its exposure in pop culture. So I think that is they key here. Classical artists where popular in their time because they were the first to write music like that. They became the archetype. If you're not impressed by new music it's because: </p>
<ol>
<li>It's unoriginal or sounds derivative.</li>
<li>It's honestly low quality.</li>
<li>Nobody has given it a listen because it has low exposure.</li>
