		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>COPPA is a law, intended to protect children under 13 from people gathering their personal information without parental permission. Violating the law allows the FTC to sue the violator for up to \~$40,000 per offence.</p>
<p>The FTC have decided to treat channel operators on Youtube like they were running a website on a host. Since Youtube collects data of viewers and serves ads based on that data, if a person who's making content for children doesn't mark the content as for children, those children's personal data is being collected without parental permission. The FTC is treating Youtube as offering a service to the channel owner.</p>
<p>It's a very legally dubious stance that came out of a settlement between Youtube and the FTC, passing the buck for most of the responsibility to channel owners.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well coppa doesn't give people fines. It is the rule. The people who give the fines are the FTC. They can give fines because they are the police for this type of situation. </p>
<p>The rule is to protect kids from big companies taking notes on what they do and watch to try to make them think or buy certain things while the kids are still too young to determine the truth of situations. </p>
<p>Its important for youtube because they have so many people making videos for them, they have to make sure there is a way to not collect this information if the videos are made for kids. This means they have to trust their video makers and/or use a computer to see if the videos are for kids.</p>
<p>This is all good so far, the reason it's a problem is the people making these videos make less money because the ad companies pay more money for ads on non kid videos because they have more information on what those people might buy. These kids videos are also more difficult to find. So you make less money per viewer and you get fewer viewers on each video. So to get around this some people are not marking kids videos to make more money which is when they get fined. </p>
<p>Most people are too worried about the fines, but in reality the only fines that will be given, will be for people actually breaking the rule. The only real issue will be from youtube. They use computer programs instead of people and already don't do a good job following these rules and punish video makers who did nothing wrong. </p>
<p>Basically you shouldn't worry about the FTC, you should worry about youtube messing up another computer program used to find the people breaking the rule.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>youtube got caught red handed, admitting that they knew minors under 13 used the website. and were having their browsing data sold to companies just like 33 year olds.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Youtube paid a RIDICULOUS fine.  hundreds of millions of dollars.   and after the settlement was done, they washed their hands of all responsibility, saying that going forward, content creators are responsible for marking their videos for kids, or not for kids.  and they gave absolutely no groundwork or explanation as to what would be considered for, or not.  they said that they legally could not say.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. It's grossly outdated and ridiculous. The tldr is from my understanding, if your video is deemed at any point to be &quot;for children&quot; which is a wide scope of things including video games, animation, the word yah(yes seriously, this is considered a kids word according to the law), bright colours etc and youve marked your video as &quot;not for kids&quot; then you will get fined 42k PER video.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What I don't fully understand in all of this, is why is it okay for TV stations that are aimed at kids to have adverts that target kids, but as it's on YouTube it's not okay? Obviously I don't condone YouTube collect kids data, but isn't it kinda the same thing? Can anyone explain why it's different?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
