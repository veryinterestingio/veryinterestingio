		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thing is. The liver doesn't really grow back. I mean, it grows back...but it doesn't grow back as it was. A liver transplant takes 1-2 lobes of liver (out of the 4 you got) and the remaining lobes will regrow to the same livermass. But they're still two lobes (only primitive lifeforms have true regeneration. Unlocking true regeneration for humans is like the holy grail of transplant science).</p>
<p>This growing back is a crucial part of the livers function, because it will be continually damaged throughout your lifetime by various toxic byproducts. But whenever it grows back it will not grow back perfect, slight imperfections and scar tissue for every regenerative cycle...and eventually those scars impede the livers function. Kind of like an analog recording of a recording. The small flaws build up over each iteration.</p>
<p>With alcoholics this is due to various reactive byproducts from heavy alcohol use (and it usually takes years of alcohol abuse to become a problem), but in other forms of cirrhosis (liver scarring) it can be due to different poisons or viral infection or because there is some sort of regenerative flaw (like replacing damaged livertissue with fat).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The same way that when you get a big wound, even after the skin heals (skin is even more regenerative than the liver ofc), it still doesn’t look quite the same. The answer is, more or less, scarring. When there is enough damage, normal tissue is replaced by scar tissue, and the tissue in that area permanently loses its ability to grow back into healthy tissue. And because alcohol hits the liver slowly and all over, you can’t really lop off a chunk and let the healthy tissue grow back over it</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The big difference is the timing, removing half a liver happens all at once and presumably the liver was healthy to start with and will be healthy after. When you drink excessively you exceed the bodies ability to heal the liver, so basically it's breaking down faster than it can repair itself. It's so focused on breaking down alcohol that it's overwhelmed. Also the byproducts of alcohol breakdown are slightly toxic to the liver and in high enough amounts add to the damage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Roughly speaking, liver is made by two different kind of cells/parts: funcional liver cells <em>(haepatocytes)</em> and structural cells and fibers. The formers &quot;do the job&quot;, the others build the <em>connective tissue</em> that gives liver its structure.</p>
<p>When liver suffers a single damaging event, like cutting out a chunk of it for organ transplant, after the event, all cells have plenty of time to replicate in a coordinated way, properly rebuilding the same amount of liver that was cut away.</p>
<p>When liver suffers chemical or metabolic damage, the funcional part is much more affected than the structural part, because the former is the one directly involved in the chemical break-up of toxins like alcohol. If the damage is not a single event, but it's a daily habit, the damage will also hit the very cells that are trying to replicate to replace the damaged ones. Keep it going long enough, and the voids will eventually be filled with easyer to build structural parts: in a word, <em>scars.</em> And since voids will be filled, functional cells will no longer have a place to growh, and eventually not even the &quot;chemical signals&quot; that multiplying is even needed. The end result is a liver that is actually bigger to compensate for the loss of function, but eventually made mostly by &quot;scar&quot;, non-functional components.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
