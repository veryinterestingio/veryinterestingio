		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First,  sorry I missed the AMA (UK based so time zone issues) hopefully someone can comment. My question: We have all heard the quoted 95% for e.g Pfizer and 70% effective for Oxford vaccines.  But it looked to me like the underlying study outputs and processes make those numbers completely incomparable. For example,  Pfizer only tested to confirm  (by PCR)  symptomatic patients,  whilst Oxford tested (at least in the UK cohort) weekly regardless of symptoms,  and as a result picked up a huge number of asymptomatic infections (almost half of the UK infections seen in the study) and included those in calculating its 70% figure.  Surely this means that on a comparable basis the Pfizer efficacy would be much lower? How can we compare them?</p>
<p>EDIT: a number of commenters have pointed out that my question was in fact based on a misunderstanding (I think based on the UK study report alone and not the pooled data article),  and that the Oxford efficacy calculation  appears to have only looked at the symptomatic cases so they are actually more comparable than I had realised. </p>
<p>Thanks to those commenters.</p>
<p>The quote from the Lancet article in the results section is that:
&quot;The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine against NAAT-confirmed COVID-19. The primary outcome was virologically confirmed, symptomatic COVID-19, defined as a NAAT-positive swab combined with at least one qualifying symptom (fever ≥37·8°C, cough, shortness of breath, or anosmia or ageusia).&quot;</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>In theory</em>, efficacy is efficacy (in this context; the expected <del>reduction in virus spread</del><em>reduction effect on some criteria associated with the virus</em>), so, being one and the same, it should be perfectly comparable.</p>
<p><strong>But</strong>, as you correctly pointed out, if people use different methods to determine that efficacy, by applying different criteria and essentially define efficacy itself differently (i.e. 'determining all cases' vs 'only determining cases where patients <strong>suffer</strong> from negative consequences of an infection'), then it's not accurate to compare them as they're two different metrics.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to have Oxford rerun their data with the same application of Pfizer's criteria (the reverse might not be possible, since Pfizer inherently excluded data from being gathered), to produce a comparable result (though it's fair to debate which of the methods is more accurate / appropriate).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;The primary efficacy analysis included <strong>symptomatic</strong> COVID-19 in seronegative participants with a nucleic acid amplification test-positive swab more than 14 days after a second dose of vaccine.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You’re 100% on track. Clinical trials are designed with internal validity in mind- how well does this vaccine work versus placebo in this specific study design (endpoint as you’ve mentioned, but also the specific populations which are variable by their inclusion criteria, patients offered enrollment, rates of testing or propensity to utilize acute care, ongoing prevalence of the virus, etc). External comparisons therefore become very challenging. Also, if there’s an interaction between vaccine efficacy with some other characteristic (say, degree of exposure to COVID or emergence of new strains), the comparisons could get impacted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It definitely seems like the bar is variable.</p>
<p>SinoVac for example, was deemed 51% effective because Brazil was very strict about “effectiveness”, so because some people tested positive and had very light symptoms like a headache, those were included against efficacy. Yet Johnson &amp; Johnson’s “66% effectiveness” wasn’t questioned, even though they explicitly said “66% effective against moderate and severe illness”.</p>
<p>The important thing is, not a single vaccine so far has failed to prevent or significantly reduce death and hospitalization, which is the goal</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
