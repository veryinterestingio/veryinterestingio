		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ugur Sahin, founder of BioNTech, which is putting out the mRNA vaccines with Pfizer, has spoken on this recently in the German media.</p>
<p>On the topic of the new UK variant:
&quot;We looked at the mutation of the virus variant.  There are several mutations there at the docking site of the virus.  We do not know what functional effects these mutations will have.  We know that our vaccine attacks the virus in many different places.  We now have two mechanisms: on the one hand, there are so-called antibody responses, and on the other, so-called T cell responses.  And we also know - we have already checked this - that the antibodies that we induce and also the T cells that we induce can also dock on many other parts of the virus that are not now mutated.  Accordingly, we are initially confident that immune responses caused by our vaccine may be able to neutralize this virus as well.  We have shown this in the past for other virus variants as well.  But we will carry out appropriate experiments and also communicate the results.&quot;

<p>On the topic of any new future mutations:
“If the vaccine doesn't work, however, it can be adapted relatively easily“ purely technologically ”, which would take maybe six weeks.  The question is whether the regulatory authorities would continue to accept the already proven effectiveness and safety in this case - otherwise a new study with tens of thousands of test persons would be necessary.
This is from a <a href="https://m.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/unternehmen/biontech-chef-wundert-sich-ueber-zoegerliche-eu-bestellung-17126235.html" target="_blank">Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung article</a> referring to an interview he gave in Der Spiegel, which is behind a paywall.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The advantage of the Pfizer/Moderna approach is that it can be tailored pretty rapidly toward the new strains - in 6-8 weeks would be my guess - but that's just the design part. Once designed, it would still need to be tested again, but as this would have the benefit of having data from similar vaccines in larger groups, the trials needed will be designed in a more specific manner, with a smaller population. In short, it will need to be tested, but that shouldn't take more than a few months.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This one was already easy to make! What's amazing about the technology is that the vaccine was actually produced only days (Jan 13 2020) after the genetic sequence for the virus was published (Jan 11 2020). The roll-out has been about demonstrating efficacy and safety -- and it's hard for me to see why the timeline for those things would change.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This strain and variant stuff is getting out of control. I urge everyone to please listen to the scientists rather than the politicians. Mutations are exceedingly common, especially with novel viruses who are just “settling in” to their new hosts. There will be lots of mutations/variants arising, there is very little reason to panic at this point.</p>
<p>All of the evidence about more infectious/more virulent is pretty much anecdotal and not peer reviewed at this really early stage. We all have to be safe, but politicians are causing people to panic unnecessarily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
