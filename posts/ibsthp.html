		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read somewhere that it's a primal response that hearkens back to our caveman days. If we heard the howling of wolves approaching, it triggered the fight or flight alarm and our hair stood on end. The idea is that some types of music can trigger that same response today.</p>
<p>I get chills all the time listening to music. My wife laughs because it doesn't happen to her at all.</p>
<p>For some reason music affects me more than the average person. Sometimes it makes me cry just listening to something beautiful. Not a sad song per se, but just music itself that's so beautiful that the tears well up in my eyes, I can't stop it. I feel ridiculous but they just stream down my cheeks, I can't seem to help it, it's just so beautiful it hurts. Fortunately that doesn't happen very often, and it's mostly when I'm alone, with headphones and no distractions.</p>
<p>But what does happen more often is that music makes my hair stand on end. I mean it <em>really</em> stands on end. It usually happens in response to a change in the music, like a chord change or progression, or the intensity or volume increasing, all of which would make total sense with the wolf howl theory.</p>
<p>I'll be driving along with my hand on the steering wheel, listening to music, and suddenly she'll notice that my arm hair is standing straight up. &quot;There you go again&quot; she says and laughs as she watches to see how long it takes until it comes back down. I'm glad she finds it amusing.</p>
<p>When it happens, it comes over me like a wave or a flush that accompanies the swell in the music. It starts from my torso and travels up my back with the hairs progressively rising, spreading out to my arms then up the back of my neck and then my face and beard. The strongest reaction is on my forearms, but if I feel even my cheek hairs get tingly then I know it's going to last longer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here:</p>
<p>Frisson, also known as aesthetic chills or musical chills, is a psychophysiological response to rewarding auditory and/or visual stimuli that often induces a pleasurable or otherwise positively-valenced affective state and transient paresthesia, sometimes along with piloerection and mydriasis. The sensation commonly occurs as a mildly to moderately pleasurable emotional response to music with skin tingling; piloerection and pupil dilation do not necessarily occur in all cases. The psychological component and physiological components of the response are mediated by the reward system and sympathetic nervous system, respectively. The stimuli that produce this response are unique to each individual. Frisson is of short duration, lasting only a few seconds. Typical stimuli include loud passages of music and passages—such as appoggiaturas and sudden modulation—that violate some level of musical expectation.Wikipedia</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s less that it’s from the great song as much as it is certain memories or feelings which the song evokes either through affiliation to life events or through emotion of the instrumentation or the impact of the lyrics.</p>
<p>The chills you are talking about is most likely the little shiver you get when you do things like turn down a loud radio or move from hot air to cold or the other way around. This sensation is the body basically resetting its senses because there was a drastic shift in the surroundings that you literally went into momentary sensory overload. This can be evoked on occasion through music both because the song itself is being experienced through a sense as well as the body’s tendency to relate physical sensation to non physical occurrence and vice versa.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s always difficult to say what the purpose of such responses are at all, or why it occur. But for the Frisson, it most likely is the same response furry/hairy animals adapted and use to make themselves look bigger when encountering or expect to be met with a larger more power animal.
In that sense, this response is related to awe, as it is triggered when our brain perceives something greater than our current self. With this in mind and as a neuropsychological fundament, the Frisson seems to be triggered by art or profoundly great music; in which we perceive as great. </p>
<p>The frisson also seem to trigger more frequently or more easily in people who are good visualisers. As they can for instance imagine, or make up if you will, scenes of themselves performing the music. Thus encountering a version of themselves that is greater than their current self, and therefore trigger the frisson.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>
