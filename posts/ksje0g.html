		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Birds chirp all the time when they are awake.</p>
<p>It's how they communicate a lot of things.</p>
<p>According to this article they wake up but the light is still too dark to do any flying around and eating so they have nothing better to do.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I've read, the dawn chorus, as it's called, is heard in most avian environments. However, there are shifts in the timing and frequency of bird songs and calls in urban/human-centric environments. This is likely due to the fact that the bird sounds have less human-induced competition for air space during the morning hours. Birds are especially good at finding environmental niches, including acoustic niches.</p>
<p>Note: this is not the sole reason for birds calling in the morning, just in addition to the other comments/explanations already posted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Birds chirp for all sorts of reasons. At dawn or dusk there will be a lot of singing, and some of them get very creative in their musicality. Other times they might be having conversations about who knows what.</p>
<p>The idea that birds chirp just to advertise themselves is just a simple answer humans have made up. Certainly they use their voice to attract mates, and creatively so, just like us. But that's just one of many things going on in bird life.</p>
<p>Birds are intelligent, creative and very aware. They will probably chirp for all the reasons we like to make sounds.</p>
<p>I'm not a bird scientist or anything. But I spend a good amount of time in nature, and I love listening to birdsong. I love to just lie down in my tent and listen to their song in the evening/morning. I also love to sit on a rock and listen to their conversations during the day.</p>
<p>If a human attracts another human with their guitar playing, is mating the reason they're playing the guitar?</p>
<p>Maybe they sing at dusk to say goodbye to the sun and maybe they are welcoming it back at dawn? Or maybe it's both social and ritualistic?</p>
<p>Personally, I like to think these birds are sun worshippers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a science radio show in Canada called Quirks and Quarks, and they had someone on to talk about this.  (I don’t remember the episode unfortunately.)  Basically they said that a bird’s song can be very complicated so for the first few hours of being awake a bird will be warming up much like an opera singer before a performance.  The songs start relatively simple and get more and more complicated as the day goes on, as usually the more complicated the song the more attractive it is to the opposite sex.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
