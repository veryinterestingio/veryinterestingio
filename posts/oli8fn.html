<p>If you can fully delete them, are the files actually destroyed in a sense?</p></div></div>

<p>When you donâ€™t need the movie anymore, you just remove the label. No one in your house think there is something in the tape, no one plays it, and you have the entire tape on which you can record something again.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like a massive whiteboard with writing all over the place.  People claim bits of the whiteboard and that part is protected - no one else is allowed to write on their section.  When you need to write something, you just claim a bit of unclaimed space. </p>
<p>When someone is done with a section, they just say, &quot;Hey, I'm not using this part of the whiteboard anymore.  Anyone is free to use it.&quot;  They don't erase what they wrote, but anyone can come along and erase/reuse that part if they need to.</p>
<p>That is how your harddrive works.  When a file is 'deleted' all that is done is harddrive says that area is available to be written.  The data is still there until something comes along and writes over it.</p>
<p>There are ways to <em>truly</em> delete the files - you can write over that section with new data multiple times.  If you do <strong>that</strong> the file is truly gone, and this 'secure delete' is used for sensitive files.  Most of the time, though, it is unnecessary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Deleting a file is like crossing it out on a books table of contents and saying you can rewrite on that page again. The data is still there and can now be overwritten since it's reference is gone. Over time those pages do get used partially by other things which is why when you try to undelete stuff you sometimes get half of an image etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your computer keeps track of its files via a <em>file system</em>. The exact details vary, but basically, it's a system that keeps track of which files are where. When you want to save a new text document, the file system takes that command from your text editor and says &quot;OK, I need to allocate 200 kB for this text document. Where's the best place to do that?&quot; Once it picks a place to save the file, it takes the information and puts it on the storage device (like, a tiny physical piece of the hard drive or other storage the information will reside on). It keeps a record that file <x> is located at position <y>. When you want to open that file again, your text editor tells the file system &quot;hey, I want this text document&quot; and the file system looks in its record book to see where that's located, and tells the storage to return the information stored there. If you add up the sizes of all the files that are written down in that record book, that's how much disk space you're using.</p>
<p>When you delete a file through a normal way (like the OS delete interface), it doesn't generally actually go back and erase the information stored on the physical hard drive. There's no need to do that, and it would take time - a lot of time for big files. Instead, all it does is tell the file system to erase the record of where that file is stored. That means that in the future, the file system doesn't know there's information there and can pick that area to store other information - a new file. This is much faster. But it does mean that until and unless a new file is written to that physical location, the information is still there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
