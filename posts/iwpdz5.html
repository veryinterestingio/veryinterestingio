		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's too complicated.</p>
<p>Blood is made of live cells:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Red cells handle the transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide, and they do this by reacting, one atom or molecule at a time, and taking the oxygen and/or carbon dioxide inside the cell, to transport it.  Oxygen specifically it's very reactive, it rusts materials, it burns them, it reacts very easily, so the red cells use complicated organic chemistry to &quot;transport it safely&quot; and deliver it to the cells in your body.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>White cells deal with intruders and infections, detecting all sorts of foreign bacteria, and eating them, and otherwise identifying the cells in your body correctly, and not hurting them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blood has platelets and other organic compounds that make it clot, when you get a cut the blood clots / hardens, blocking the cut and more blood from seeping out.</p>
</li>
<li>Blood transports hormones, nutrients from your digestive system, byproducts of digestion to be taken out by your kidneys, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's just too complex; we don't have chemistry that's complex enough to handle all these functions with just chemicals, and we don't have the biology that's advanced enough to create designer blood cells to handle these functions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most cells are incredibly complex nano-machines. Or rather, an incredibly complex micro-machine made up of nano-machines.</p>
<p>Human engineering of nano-scale technology is in its infancy right now. Most of the things we're constructing are based on a single principle or function in a natural process of biology.</p>
<p>In order to build a blood cell that could even match up to our own, we would need to build something that can function for 100-120 days of circulation and constant use, without failure.</p>
<p>And hemoglobin alone is a complex chemical. In order to perform its function, it has to hold onto O^(2), but not too tightly. It's essentially the only molecule that can do the job in the human body that we know of, because we've never used anything else. In order to create it, we need to actually understand how the body does so, and that is one hell of a process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hemoglobin (Hb) is synthesized in a complex series of steps. The heme part is synthesized in a series of steps in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondria" target="_blank">mitochondria</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosol" target="_blank">cytosol</a> of immature red blood cells, while the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globin" target="_blank">globin</a> protein parts are synthesized by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome" target="_blank">ribosomes</a> in the cytosol.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin#cite_note-36" target="_blank">[36]</a> Production of Hb continues in the cell throughout its early development from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proerythroblast" target="_blank">proerythroblast</a> to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticulocyte" target="_blank">reticulocyte</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow" target="_blank">bone marrow</a>. At this point, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus" target="_blank">nucleus</a> is lost in mammalian red blood cells, but not in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" target="_blank">birds</a> and many other species. Even after the loss of the nucleus in mammals, residual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_RNA" target="_blank">ribosomal RNA</a> allows further synthesis of Hb until the reticulocyte loses its RNA soon after entering the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system" target="_blank">vasculature</a> (this hemoglobin-synthetic RNA in fact gives the reticulocyte its reticulated appearance and name).<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin#cite_note-Burka_-_RNA_degradation-37" target="_blank">[37]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suffice it to say, we're a long way from building anything like this in mass quantities.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
