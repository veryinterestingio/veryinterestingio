		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The French used to play a game called jeu de paume, which was like tennis but with the palms of their hands.</p>
<p>The courts were 90 feet long, so each player had 45 feet to play in.
When the player got a point they were allowed to move up the court - the first time 15 feet, the second another 15 (to 30 feet), and finally 10 feet (to 40 feet) so there was still a 5 foot gap from the player to the net.
The scores still follow this pattern. They could have changed it I suppose, so it would go &quot;15, 30, 45&quot;, but 45 is harder to say than 40</p>
<p>L'oeuf means egg in French, representing zero, so this is a plausible explanation forLove,15,30,40.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Love&quot; is usually (read: what I have seen a couple of places) taken to be a bastardisation of &quot;l'oeuf&quot;, the French for &quot;the egg&quot;. Because this is what a 0 looks like.</p>
<p>Incidentally, similar reason why a batsman getting 0 in an innings in cricket has scored a duck: short for &quot;duck's egg&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So far I've seen 2 different theories posted in this thread with statements saying they are unproven. I have a third one that up until now I always assumed was just the actual known answer. It must be another unproven theory, so I'll add it in...</p>
<p>The one I heard is that the scoring system comes from a game similar to tennis that was played by British naval officers in India in the 19th century. When firing a salute the ship's fist deck would fire it's 15 pound cannon, then the second deck would fire it's 30 pound cannon, and last the third deck would fire it's 40 pound cannon. They would supposedly use those poundage numbers for scoring their game.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
