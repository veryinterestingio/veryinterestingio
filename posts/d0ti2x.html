		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Used to work for a manufacturer of those fuzzy blankets. Most of the time, they lose softness because they are washed incorrectly. If you have a fuzzy blanket, wash it all by itself on cold. Then, tumble dry (again by itself) with no heat or air dry it. Most issues are caused by fabric rubbing against the blanket or by people tumble drying regular. Most super fuzzy blankets are polyester and it will melt in the dryer - usually not so bad so you notice right away, but over time, the combo is enough to cause serious issues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So most items of clothing and especially tableware/bedding has what is called “sizing” applied as the last step of manufacture.</p>
<p>This is a coating or a wash of various chemicals, that make the fabric feel whatever way they want it to.  Super soft, or crinkly, or a finish that makes clothing not wrinkle before sale, or smoothing the fibres, etc.  It’s all to make the items more appealing in store.  When you wash your items, the sizing chemicals are washed off.</p>
<p>Sizing is the main reason everyone is very strongly encouraged to wash items you buy before using or wearing them, yet no one does (and you really really should, because a huge amount is made in China which doesn’t have the best industrial track record when it comes to poisonous chemicals on clothing).</p>
<p>You can use fabric conditioner to soften again.  It’s actually bad for textiles long term, but it is effective.  Vinegar also quite good.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Roughening of fabric occurs  because magnesium and calcium salts from detergent are deposited on it.  In addition, if the water is hard, then limescale forms. </p>
<p>The softest is the rain water and the water after the snow melting. But we use the one that flows in the water conduit. ))  This water can be softened by adding table vinegar in a proportion of 100-200 ml per 10 liters of water. A solution of vinegar can be poured into the compartment of the air conditioning device.  It is also necessary to use better detergents. Mostly liquid and gel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
