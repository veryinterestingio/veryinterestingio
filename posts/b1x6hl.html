		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called <strong><em>Globus Pharyngeus</em></strong> and is the sensation that the throat is partly blocked when it is actually not. The causes are speculated about but it's generally just inflammation of the larynx/hypopharynx and is painless.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Causes suggested include cricopharyngeal spasm, lingual tonsil, cervical osteophytosis, hiatus hernia, gastro-oesophageal reflux, sinusitis, post-nasal drip, goitre, foreign body, anxiety, and, very rarely, hypopharyngeal cancer.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4582871/#b2" target="_blank">2</a></p>
<p>Psychological factors may also play a role. There is increased reporting of stressful life events prior to development of symptoms and research suggests that as many as 96% of patients with globus sensation report an exacerbation of symptoms during times of emotional intensity.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4582871/#b3" target="_blank">3</a> Questions on symptoms of globus pharyngeus are included in diagnostic questionnaires for somatisation, panic, and generalised anxiety disorders.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4582871/#b2" target="_blank">2</a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called Globus Pharyngeus, the globus sensation is a feeling often referred to a lump in the throat people some people describe it as scratchy, throbbing, tense or if they have a pill stuck in their throat it's not painful but it is annoying. The difference between it and other throat issues is that there is no actual lump in the throat when someone experiences the globus sensation. It's different from dysphagia which is difficulty swallowing however people sometimes report difficulty swallowing or feel anxious that swallowing will cause choking</p>
<p>The causes of it is the throat muscles and mucous membranes can feel strained when the throat is dry, causing feelings that something is stuck in the throat. Medications and some medical conditions may cause dry throat and one of the most common causes of a dry throat is frequent swallowing due to anxiety. Since some people respond to the globus sensation by swallowing more frequently, anxiety about the globus sensation can make symptoms worse.</p>
<p>TL;DR When your anxious or upset you tend to swallow more frequently which dries the throat and strains it thus giving you that feeling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There certainly is a biological answer to this I’m sure, and a more scientific one. However, these are not the only modalities for looking at the world. One explanation for this phenomenon is that the emotions you feel when you are upset or anxious often trigger you to want to cry out, yell, make a variety of different noises. This is not often an acceptable way of appearing in public or even in private and so your body is tightening up and suppressing yourself from doing these things. If you want to get a full on hippie dippy about this, often those emotions are actually being stored in some form or another in the muscles surrounding your hyoid bone. Anecdotally, I have witnessed people release these emotions and make small noises or start crying when this area of the body is worked on during therapeutic massage. Those people who are comfortable enough to share actually expressed that they suddenly experienced a rush of emotion and sometimes had an associated memory pop up in their head as well. Again, this is not well researched and based on scientific studies, but rather my anecdotal experiences as a one time practitioner of complementary medicine</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
