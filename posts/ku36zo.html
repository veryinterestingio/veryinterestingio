<p>There are a few specific theories, of course, but I'll speak in general. </p>
<p>In general, halogens are extremely unstable. They REALLY... REALLY want an extra electron. Because of this, it makes them extremely reactive, which means they react with... just about anything. Now, when this happens on a bacterial cell, it will often disrupt processes that allow the cell to survive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a difference between chlorine and chloride, same as iodine and iodide. The ine is for the elemental form, which in the case of the halogens can be pretty nasty. The ide is the solvated ion, which doesn't mean it's all dissociated from everything, just that it's in an equilibrium likely in aqueous solution.</p>
<p>An atoms reactivity is affected by what's in proximity so for the case of the diatomic halogen there's two pretty negative charged atoms wiggling about, these have applications in chemistry for halogenating things.
In the case of a chloride or iodide solution there's not so much of this through bond interaction so you can think of it as a load of spherical negative charges floating about in solution. At weak concentrations that's not very interesting to us, we need these ions for cellular functions, it's why we need a small amount of salt in our diet.
Another form of chloride is HCl, which has a bad rap. In its gaseous form it's pretty nasty and will dissolve onto wet surfaces to form hydrochloric acid. The nasty part of that is mostly the H+. If you dilute the solution you go from an irritant/corrosive to a pretty benign solution. Same stuff, just altered concentrations of H+ (or H3O+).</p>
<p>In the form of iodide is kind of like chloride in that it's an ion that's found naturally in the body, but in lower concentrations. For a bacteria or a human cell there's a lot of very useful proteins and other thingys sliding about, a lot of their functions are dependent on ion movements which can be viewed as the transfer of energy through a carrier. They're very specific and a lot of cellular machinery is made for very tight fits with the exact amount of energy needed to release an ion again being determined by the competing nature's of all the atoms in a protein and it's solution environment. Alas if you introduce a chunky boy iodide where it's not meant to be it's going to mess stuff up. Unfortunately there's no specific mechanism of destruction as iodide can interact with so much of the cellular machinery. Proteins of different types, DNA/RNA, cell membranes all use careful balances of ions to tune their effects.</p>
<p>The human cell is susceptible to this too. However the loss of a couple of cells on the surface of the skin to purge the bacteria is a good trade. The digestive system is good at filtering specific ions out too, so it's likely able to make good use of the iodide it needs and pass out the rest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As some other commenters have already mentioned, iodine doesn't, strictly speaking, purify (remove unwanted things from) water like a filter or adsorbent resin would.  What 'water purifier' iodine tablets do is sterilise (kill living, harmful organisms in) water that may have harmful bacteria or other organisms in it.  Municipal water supplies often use chlorine, another halogen element, either by itself or in the form of more stable molecules like chloramine, to prevent bacteria growing in your tap water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
