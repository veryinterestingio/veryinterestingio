		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We often call the process of &quot;speaking&quot; a language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_production" target="_blank">language production</a>. It's way more than just speaking.</p>
<p>The first thing to keep in mind is that using language keeps your brain very busy. If you ever thought that the whole &quot;10% of your brain&quot; thing had even conditional truth to it, go take a look at fMRIs of people doing simple linguistic tasks — real talking uses most parts of your brain, as you're generally engaging spatial, quantitative, emotional, and all sorts of other reasoning on the fly as you're conjuring up words and orchestrating your various meat-flaps to represent them.</p>
<p>When you're understanding a language, the number of steps you have to do is cut down dramatically. Your ear picks up acoustic signal; you bucket into phonemes, which if you're proficient is going to be sensitive to the language you're listening for; you build those sound-idea strings into morphological segments, which you gradually slot into phrases and sentences; and then, in normal listening, as you <em>infer</em> enough, you're pretty much done—you get the idea and it's just refining. There's time in there to do some quick spot-translations, to do some on-the-fly word order swaps, and other touch-up work, especially if the speaker isn't going at all-out max speed at you.</p>
<p>Contrast that to language production. Hoo boy. First you have an idea; Sapir-Wharf debates notwithstanding, the very early concepts of what you're trying to say are at least <em>unspecialized</em> to a language's specific quirks. From the idea, you have to create a sentence structure around it. Maybe you normally use SOV ordering but you're trying to make an SVO sentence. That's a cognitive overhead tax on you. Then you start trying to find the right words. More overhead. Now you're trying to recall the right sounds to go along with it; more tax. Finally, while you're generally still trying to juggle all of that, you're trying to orchestrate those meat-flaps to make the unfamiliar sounds. More tax. It adds up! Without practice, it's just too much to do at full speed. And practice, in the meaningful sense, is an extremely contextual thing; replying to the questions and answers fixed to a topic in your textbook is going to only have a small crossover with the highly-inferred, highly chaotic banter you get in a real, typical conversation.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, there's an extra sociolinguistic aspect that kicks in where the self-awareness of speaking &quot;indirectly&quot; levies yet more of a cognitive hit, which helps explain why some people will objectively speak a language better when they're a bit drunk.</p>
<p>So, tl;Dr? &quot;Speaking&quot; is a whole lot more than speaking, and it's hard work until you've done a lot of it in very representative environments—listening has many fewer and much more predictable difficulty variables in the speed and complexity, while production is just way more nuanced and complicated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another thing to keep in mind with language is that practice makes perfect. He isn't practicing his Arabic speaking, so it isn't getting any easier for his brain to process it, but he still practices listening. Doing this for a long enough time would create a gap between his and your speaking abilities. All he has to do is start speaking Arabic more and he'll quickly be able to speak it as well as you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Language can be broken up in many ways, but for the sake of this discussion I'll talk about two parts- expressive language and receptive language. When you actively attend to someone who is talking and apply meaning to what they are saying, you are building on your receptive language skills, or the language input skills. That can be through writing or through auditory processing. And just like any skill, the more you practice a skill, the stronger the communication between neural pathways becomes. So if you ACTIVELY practice comprehending, then you will become better at that area. So if you wanted to become better at speaking, you would need to practice speaking in that language, and the neural connections would strengthen in that area. </p>
<p>What typically occurs is that there are more ways to practice listening then speaking. For example, on language learning apps, there is a lot of reading and responding that occurs. This is the same when listening to music or podcasts to practice. The other element is that when practicing speaking with others, it is beneficial to have strong receptive language skills in that language in order to generate a response to a conversational partner. The other thing to consider is the general anxiety that can impact an individual's ability to speak in a new language. Stress can inhibit processing speed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you are translating rather than directly associating. Let’s say you speak English and the language in question is Spanish. To you Hola=Hello. To them hola is the word used to greet someone. So for you, there’s an extra step. You think of the word then have to remember the word it translates to. There isn’t a direct link between the word and what you want to communicate. So the extra time it takes you to think of the words to translate makes it impossible to keep up with in conversation. It’s easy to translate from the language back to english because the words are associated with the translation, and is like added vocabulary words. You can recall the definition and understand what those words mean, but when it comes to constructing a sentence you have to think of what you want to say in the original language, and then figure out the translation. It’s also easier to guess words you don’t know yet based on context when understanding. It’s pretty much like comparing me asking you to tell me the meaning of words or guess the meaning of one used in a sentence, as opposed to me giving you a definition or synonym and you having to guess the a word I’m thinking of. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
