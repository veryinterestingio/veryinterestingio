		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The “Sputnik” COVID vaccine is a fairly standard approach to modern vaccines. It consists of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, in replication-defective recombinant adenoviruses. They used a slightly novel approach by using two different adenoviruses, human Ad26 and Ad5. </p>
<p>This is a very generic approach. Replication-defective adenoviruses are very well understood and have been used in many different contexts in humans. One disadvantage is that the wild viruses are very common in humans and there’s widespread immunity to them, so there’s the potential that immunity will block the vaccine carrier. A Chinese COVID vaccine using Ad5 as a carrier found this may be a concern since responses were lower in Ad5-immune people. The AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine uses a similar approach but uses a chimpanzee adenovirus that humans aren’t immune to, to avoid this problem. The Sputnik approach is to use two different adenoviruses instead. </p>
<p>So it’s a pretty well understood approach, and what we’ve seen with COVID vaccines so far is that they aren’t a real challenge - it’s quite easy to get good, durable immunity against SARS-CoV-2 using many different approaches. </p>
<p>The reason it’s controversial is that the Russians haven’t been at all forthcoming about the data. They’ve released some small scale data (<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(20\)31866-3/fulltext" target="_blank">Safety and immunogenicity of an rAd26 and rAd5 vector-based heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccine in two formulations: two open, non-randomised phase 1/2 studies from Russia</a>) but no large scale safety data.  What’s more, the official announcements have seemed to jump directly from small trials to widespread deployment, without waiting for large Phase 3 trials. </p>
<p>(Also, there were questions about the quality of the data in the Phase 1/2 trials, but I won’t get into that.)</p>
<p>There’s no particular reason to <em>expect</em> this to be anything but safe, but vaccines need to be tested. These vaccines <em>are</em> undergoing Phase 3 clinical trials involving several tens of thousands of people:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The researchers launched clinical trials in June. On Aug. 11, President Vladimir V. Putin announced that a Russian health care regulator had approved the vaccine, renamed Sputnik V, before Phase 3 trials had even begun. Vaccine experts decried the move as risky, and Russia later walked back the announcement, saying that the approval was a “conditional registration certificate,” which would depend on positive results from Phase 3 trials. Those trials, initially planned for just 2,000 volunteers, were expanded to 40,000. In addition to Russia, volunteers were recruited in Belarus, the United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela. On Oct. 17, a Phase 2/3 trial was launched in India.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html" target="_blank">Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker</a></p>
<p>But there are also ethical questions about those trials:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Against this backdrop, the phase 3 trials of Sputnik V have already begun. However, the required 40 000 volunteers stirred a political and human rights debate. Some Russian media reports cite the Federation contemplating to roll out a mass vaccination programme for Sputnik V. The head of a trade union for physicians, Anastasia Vasilieva (The Doctors’ Alliance, Moscow), who exposed the flaws in Russia's COVID-19 numbers, questions the plans for mass vaccination and mandating volunteering as a “real sabotage”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So bottom line, there’s nothing clearly <em>wrong</em> with the vaccine, the principles are solid and well understood, but the overall political approach to this has left people concerned that the politics may have pushed the science instead of the other way around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>General lack of transparency (no public protocols, etc)</li>
<li>Not following widely accepted trial practices</li>
<li>Claiming success (safety and efficacy) based on far too few participants (initially just 20)</li>
<li>Vaccinating people (outside of trials) before initial endpoints of phase III are met</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32156-5/fulltext" target="_blank">Concerns</a> about vaccine type. This alone does not mean it is an unsafe vaccine, but it is an additional source of scrutiny.</li>
