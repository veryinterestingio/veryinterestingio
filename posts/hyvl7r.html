		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's one of those reflexes we've retained from the days when we had fur.</p>
<p>Intense experiences activate a part of our nervous system that's known as the <em>sympathetic nervous system</em>. When this is activated, our body responds with a number of different things that are supposed to make us ready to fight and/or flee, or ready to face any challenging environment. This includes an increased heart rate, mobilization of our energy stores to keep our muscles well supplied, as well as a host of other biological reflexes. Basically, the sympathetic nervous system is responsible for all those things that we associate with an adrenaline rush in everyday speech (in fact, adrenaline is a key component of the sympathetic nervous system).</p>
<p>This part of the nervous system isn't controlled by us consciously, and operates by itself (called <em>autonomously</em> in medical language). All the hairs on your skin have tiny muscles connected to them called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrector_pili_muscle" target="_blank"><em>arrector pili</em> muscles</a>. When the sympathetic nervous system is activated, it also activates these muscles. They make the hairs on the skin stand up, which in furred animals traps air between the hairs and increases insulation (which makes them better equipped to face the cold).</p>
<p>Although we've evolved to lose our dense fur, we still have some hair and arrector pili muscles - and whenever your body experiences something intense enough to make it think it's about to fight, it activates these age old reflexes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Idk about the fur/reflex thing. Might be correct. As I understood it though, some people hear the music, differently. A slight difference in the brain processing what you're hearing. Also, not everyone has this <em>ability</em> if you will.  That is why you feel goosebumps/chills.</p>
