		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no such thing as a zero resistance conductor outside of superconductors. Resistance means the electrons are slowed down as they move through the wire or component, almost like friction, and that generates heat. The more electricity you try to pass through a thing, the more heat is generated. At some point, the temperature will be above the failure point of the component and it will get damaged.</p>
<p>CPUs and GPUs have what is called a <em>clock speed</em>. Think of a string of binary code, that might be something like 0101100101. How does the computer know that it's two 1s or two 0s in a row? What if there are three, or four, or five 1s or 0s in a row? How does the computer know when one 1 stops and the next 1 begins? There is a clock that only ever goes 10101010... Each digit is a flip that drives the rest of the chip. The faster that clock goes, the faster everything else goes, too.</p>
<p>But making the clock go faster means pushing more electricity through the chip. If your clock speed is too high, you generate too much heat and your chip is damaged and stops working. Built into your computer are two limiters. One of them is a thermostat that will limit your clock speed when the computer gets too hot. This is called thermal throttling. The other is like a governor on your clock speed that the manufacturer says is the maximum safe clock speed. You can tell the computer to have a higher default clock speed above that preset maximum, but it may not be stable because it will spike the temperatures up faster than it can be reliably throttled down and cause problems.</p>
<p>If you keep your computer cooler with better cooling devices, like bigger, better heat sinks and fans, water cooling blocks, liquid nitrogen, or even liquid helium, you can increase the clock speed that your chip runs at without the chip overheating and becoming damaged or unstable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many motherboards will decrease CPU and GPU performance when it gets too hot. This is to prevent damaging the chip. Also, heat will wear the microcomponents inside the chip. However, heat really won't affect the performance of the chip, not regarding the motherboard's automatic underclocking and decrease of using resources.</p>
<p>This is also why if you would like to overclock, you need to make sure you have good cooling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of great in-depth information in this thread, but the short, simple response is that they <em>don't</em> perform significantly better when cool. However, sustained high temperatures will shorten the lifespan of the semiconductors, and extremely high temperatures will damage them rapidly. Running faster generates more heat, so better cooling allows that heat to be taken away more effectively, meaning they can reach higher speeds without climbing to harmful temperatures.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR genuine ELI5:</strong> It's not that running cool helps them perform better; it's that running fast makes heat, running hot is bad for them, and better cooling makes it possible for them to run faster without breaking from getting too hot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>as a rule, electrical resistance increases with temperature, which decreases performance. </p>
<p>however, most computers are programmed to throttle performance in response to heat in order to protect itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They have an internal mechanism that keeps them from burning up. It works by throttling back when the chip gets too hot. So if you keep it cool you keep it running at the max speed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
