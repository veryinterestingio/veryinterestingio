		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is likely that horses/ponys were domesticated multiple times throughout human history. So the biological variances between the species started out as regional differences.</p>
<p>One interesting historical example of this was seen with the Mongol conquest of Asia. Mongols are known as the greatest horsemen in history. However, it is interesting to see in the secret histories that they were extremely impressed by the quality of Middle-Eastern and Eastern Europen horses. They historically rode small ponies into battle. But as they conquered, the quality of their mounts increased dramatically as they gained access to new gene pools and better horses.</p>
<p>But otherwise, the phenotypic equestrian traits are manipulated like any other domestic animal. In the same way that selective breeding has produced the hundreds of varieties of dogs we see today. Horses are bred for a purpose. Quarter horses and draft horses are the same species. But years of selective breeding has molded horses into the most useful forms. It's all about purposeful breeding for selection of desired characteristics.</p>
<p>However, as with dogs, genetically they are still the same species. And the very obvious phenotypic differences between breeds are not really as obvious at the genetic level. That is to say a German Shepherd and a Chihuahua are 99.9% the same genetically. They can still interbreed, but you would never guess that just by looking at them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, I did a research paper for college last year about the origins and effects if horse domestication last year. It's a fascinating subject.</p>
<p>So fair warning this is mostly history, but these things all had direct effects on the physiology of horses over time.</p>
<p>The first thing to know is that original wild horses were smaller. Much smaller,  so a full grown man could theoretically ride one for a short distance, but they were mostly used similar to pack animals like Donkeys for a while. This is why the chariot was invented. Because using 2+ horses to pull a chariot doesn't require a larger horse.</p>
<p>Now, when did horses get big enough to ride? This is still kind of a mystery. The ancient Greeks have a treatise on training cavalry horses. But from there it's a several hundred year jump back in time to when we see evidence of people trying it. Namely remains of bridles, which were originally leather and wood etc so the remains are scarce at this point. But metal ones came along during the early Bronze age. That said even though horses were <em>larger</em> and big enough to carry a man, they still weren't <em>mounted cavalry</em> as we think of today. The horse mostly served to get a soldier to and from the battlefield because they weren't large enough to carry a fully armed and armored soldier for extended periods of time.</p>
<p>So the biggest physiological change in the early years was size. Horses got much, much larger.</p>
<p>Second, the original species of domesticated horse no longer exists. To compare it to dogs, it would be like wolves not existing because every single wolf was captured for domestication. There is one just one remains species of wild horse called the Przwalski horse, which recent DNA evidence has indicated may not be totally wild anymore. As an example, all the wild horses in the americas are feral horses descended from escaped horses brought over from Europe, mostly by the Spanish.</p>
<p>So, it's generally assumed that the original horses looked much like the przwalski horses. So compare those to a modern horse. That should give you a pretty good idea of how dramatically horses have changed over the years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's kind of crazy that despite breeding, nutrition and modern pharmaceuticals (theres a lot of diff steroids meant for horses) the world record largest draft horse was born in 1846. One would assume they would have bred a larger one by now even if just for show, but nope it's been nearly 200 years.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends a great deal on what sport they’ve been selectively bred for, not to mention what breeds they evolved from. Arabians and draft horses have very different origin stories.</p>
<p>A lot are more docile, less flighty (spooky), more likely to trust, and generally easier going. We’ve tried to breed their fight or flight tendencies out, because although they are necessary in the wild, they’re a PITA when someone pops an umbrella open 5’ from the show ring and you find yourself halfway to Kansas 30 seconds later.</p>
<p>But it’s hard to draw the line on what other features were there from the beginning, and which ones have been a by product of selective breeding — especially with the first Arabians being tamed around 3500 BC.</p>
