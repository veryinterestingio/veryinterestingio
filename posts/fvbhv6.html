		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you smoke weed, it releases the &quot;reward&quot; hormone, serotonin or dopamine or whatever. This is why stoners can be unmotivated, they don't get the reward in the brain for completing tasks, they get it from weed. So when quitting, it's normal to become mildly depressed and apathetic for a couple of days as your body gets used to releasing these chemicals without the help of weed. Trouble falling asleep is the most normal effect of quitting, and can be a real bitch. Also the appetite can really take a hit and this might last for weeks before feeling normal again, but then it's often better than when smoking every day. As mentioned, you also start dreaming pretty heavily as you don't dream when smoking. Sweaty hands and sweating while sleeping is also normal. I've had all these symptoms when quitting, but have also experienced way less other times I quit. It's individual, but I find it really weird I'm the first one to say there are effects, while other comments claim there are none. If there were none there wouldn't be so many stoners.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are kind of three drop offs. Obviously, the last time you smoke, you are high like normal. Then you come down like normal, this is step one.</p>
<p>Step two: it actually takes 1-3 days after the last smoke for the very faint hangover/lingering thc to leave the brain. it's super mild, but it's there.</p>
<p>Step 3: 14-60 days for the thc to leave the fat cells where it is stored - this depends on a lot of stuff, don't assume it's &quot;how much fat you have.&quot; this is why it takes so long for you to have clean pee.</p>
<p>like all drugs, cannabis kind of replaces natural chemicals (endocannabinoids) your body makes, so even the trickle being releases by your fat cells for 2-8 weeks after will reduce your body's need to make its own. </p>
<p>this is a long way of saying cannabis's recovery period is mild but very slow</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
