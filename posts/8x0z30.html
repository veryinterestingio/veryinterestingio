		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe this has to do with an effect known as &quot;the uncanny valley&quot;. See, humans aren't particulsrly more difficult than animals to animate, but we as humans notice slight errors in animated humans fsr better than other things. Thus, what you call a photorealistic animal likely has some distinct differences from an actual film of that animal, but our brain is not keyed to detect that. However, if an animated human has a similar amount of difference, our brain picks up on it much, much easier and we think it looks &quot;off&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it is mostly a problem with the audience not the animation itself.</p>
<p>An astonishingly big part of the human brain is tasked with looking at, recognizing and parsing information from human faces. We are evolutionary optimized fro that sort of thing.</p>
<p>If grass looks vaguely like grass that is good enough in most cases. A human face however is something we pay a lot more attention to. We can recognize something as a face if it is just hinted at with two dots and a line :) or greatly stylized as a smiley: 😀</p>
<p>But we are so focused on looking at faces for information vital to our survival that we can recognize that something is not quite right with a face, even if it is almost photorealistic.</p>
<p>Even if we can't put it into words we know that something is wrong with a face and parts of us that have evolved over a really long time will cry out in the back of our minds urging us to that something is not right here. This is when you get the uncanny valley effect. Close enough to the real thing to be almost mistaken for it but still not quite good enough to pass as it.</p>
<p>So making an almost photorealistic background is easy enough. With humans you either make them purposefully not quite realistic or you have to put a ton of extra effort into it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's about how much attention we pay to things. If something is on the table, looks vaguely like a vase, and has flowers in it, then I will glance at it, mark it as a vase in my mind, then dismiss it from my thoughts as unimportant. Human faces are different. We look at them in detail and watch the tiny movements as we try to gauge the person's current mood. Because we look in such great detail, we will notice any tiny little thing that seems &quot;off&quot; with the vision, even though we couldn't possibly explain in detail exactly what it was that doesn't seem quite right. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not entirely sure because I'm not an animator, but I would think complexity has a good bit to do with it. Like take grass, it's really just a some tapered triangles with a clothlike texture and boom grass is done. But humans are so much more complex than that. We have pores, hair everywhere, a whole bunch of muscles that move slightly, imperfections ect.</p>
<p>On top of that, humans are really good at recognizing faces. That's why we see faces in everyday objects. So I'd imagine the brain is particularly good at figuring out what a real face is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The uncanny valley is definitely a factor in this, but take it from someone who works in the animation industry—the real answer is money. 2D BGs are paintings and generally have minimal interaction with the characters moving on top of them. This allows them to mostly be still images, which means that BG artist can spend the time to paint them since their complicated artwork won’t have to be animated. It’s why in old cartoons like Scooby Doo you could always tell that one trash can that was going to be interacted with, because it was drawn more simply than the painted ones around it. Animating even simple humans is hard as it is—walk cycles are incredibly complex, and the more realistic the human the more time and effort it takes to animate a second of your content. Why pay all the extra money to do that when you can design a character more simplistically and it won’t be a detriment to your audiences connection to them?</p>
<p>TL;DR: Simple designs don’t have to worry about the uncanny valley, but serve a dual purpose because they are also cheaper to animate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
