		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is almost entirely a modern day myth. There were systems in place to ensure the town's water supply wasn't contaminated and drinking water in most of the world was perfectly fine. They even had a system where tanners and blacksmiths and such would be fined if their cast offs made it into the water supply and they were only allowed to operate in certain areas of town to keep the water supply clean. </p>
<p>The laborer's DID drink a lot of ale and beer while working but it was because the alcohol content was so low that it kept them hydrated and helped give them calories to keep up their energy. It was more like medieval Gatorade than actual alcohol as we think of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Their alcoholic drinks were WAYYY less strong than today’s. A plain beer in history might only be 2-3% alcohol, with modern day beers 4-5% is standard on the low end, some get up to 8%.</p>
<p>So, the dehydrating effects of their drinks really weren’t as serious. Also, in most cases, people still drank water, it was only really rare situations where the water wasn’t trusted in cities/urban areas. But even then, take Ancient Rome*, they built massive infrastructure (aqueducts) to bring water into their cities and into their fountains, fountains that people did drink out of. The idea that people never drank water is a fallacy.</p>
<p>Edit: Rome not room</p>
<p>Edit 2: there are many beers above 8%, I based my point on the most common brands I see, and maybe that’s skewed for me cuz I’m a poor American student who only gets Cheaper light beer. Also to those Belgians who told me that that’s Kiddo beer I’d love to try whatever y’all got goin on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you think of the kind of beer that people would drink all day, it’s nowhere near the alcohol volume that you’d expect from beer today - small beer back then was more like 1% abv.  Many cultures that drank wine would dilute the wine with water to make it less harsh.  So there were a lot of ways to minimize the amount of alcohol taken in while still using it to make water potable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can sustain your water hydration with a 5% beer easily if that is all you drink. Your liver won't like it, your kidneys won't like it, probably your stomach and digestive system but you can sustain off beer for at least 10 years so far....</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
