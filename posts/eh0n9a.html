I would think they train the same way but the muscle size is so different.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Question: are you sure that the women really have very thick legs, or is it just that they seem thick because they’re so much thicker than the upper half of their body? Most elite runners I know are pretty damn skinny. The less excess body fat, the less weight they have to drag along with them in the race. However, women genetically have more body fat in their thighs and hips than men do. This will be present in women no matter how slender they are, unless they get so skinny that they are unhealthy, which would make them slower and then they wouldn’t be elite runners. But these same women won’t have excess body fat in their upper body—there’s not the same genetic predisposition for that. They also will have less muscle than a man in their upper body. The net result is that elite women runners will have thinner upper bodies than elite men, and larger hips and thighs than elite men, making their legs looks relatively thicker than elite men’s legs, and even disproportionate as compared with thin women who are not athletes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Women naturally carry more weight in their thighs and hips than men. Therefore most non-elite marathon female runners will be carrying their excess weight there vs. men who tend to carry it in their gut and upper body. But at the world class elite level, both men and women are essentially twigs in their legs along with the rest of their bodies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
