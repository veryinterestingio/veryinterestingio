		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With the news of US President Donald Trump's impeachment by Congress likely to be prominent in the news cycle for the coming weeks/months, we feel it is important to share a reminder of some of our rules, particularly the nuances of Rule 2.  Please be sure that you have read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/wiki/detailed_rules" target="_blank">the detailed rules</a> before posting.</p>
<ul>
<li>ELI5 is not for <strong>current events</strong>.  Questions regarding the currently-developing news are not permitted.</li>
<li>ELI5 is not for <strong>soapboxing</strong>.  Do not post a question which is really your opinion in disguise, or which is designed to attract arguments.</li>
<li>ELI5 is not for <strong>straightforward questions</strong>.  &quot;What is impeachment?&quot; &quot;Has anyone been impeached before?&quot; - These have very simple one-sentence answers.</li>
<li>ELI5 is not for <strong>legal questions</strong>.  &quot;Why was the vote conducted this way?&quot; &quot;What will happen next?&quot; &quot;Why is impeachment a thing?&quot; - These are questions based on the law.</li>
<li>ELI5 is not for <strong>speculation or subjective questions</strong>.  &quot;What are the chances of removal from office?&quot; &quot;How will people react?&quot; - There is no way to answer these objectively and factually.</li>
<li>ELI5 is not for <strong>loaded questions and false premises</strong>.  Be sure that your question is objective and not couched in certain assumptions or opinions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please also remember to <strong>search before posting</strong>.  Here are a couple impeachment-related questions which have already been answered:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5n7zbn/eli5_how_does_impeachment_actually_work_in_the_us/" target="_blank">How does Impeachment actually work in the US?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/6d220z/eli5_if_a_president_is_impeached_how_can_the_vice/" target="_blank">If a president is impeached, how can the Vice President step up to become president?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When leaving comments, please keep in mind to <strong>be civil</strong> and that <strong>top-level comments must be an objective explanation of the question</strong>.  As always, if you see a rule-breaking post or comment, please report it rather than replying to it.</p>
<p>Posts and comments violating these rules will not be tolerated.</p>
