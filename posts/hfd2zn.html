<p>Edit: Thank you, everybody for your very informative answers. TLDR: clones are essentially as normal as if they were naturally born. There is a very fine balance between healthy cell repair and cancer, and we haven't quite figured out how to control it reliably yet.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>No</strong>. Studies have shown that clones are perfectly healthy. There is a lot of misinformation and confusion surrounding the premature death of Dolly the sheep, but this was due to cancer caused by a retrovirus not from cloning (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_(sheep)" target="_blank">source</a>).</p>
<p>Cloning works through a process called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_cell_nuclear_transfer" target="_blank">somatic cell nuclear transfer</a> in which the nucleus from one cell is added to an egg from another animal thus resulting in a clone with identical DNA. </p>
<p>You would expect shortened telomeres to cause problems but cells early in development can turn on genes and repair mechanisms normally silenced later in life. Telomeres can be repaired and overall old DNA doesnâ€™t contain that many mutations, DNA repair mechanisms and apoptosis are surprisingly effective. </p>

<p>Since DNA degrades as we age</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to clarify this point because it's not entirely accurate.</p>
<p>DNA doesn't &quot;degrade&quot; in the sense of being broken down. As we age, cells have more time to accumulate harmful mutation either through errors in DNA replication or things like UV light exposure causing DNA bases to dimerize. DNA is maintained through an aptly names &quot;proofreading&quot; system. But more time and more cell replications increases the chances for errors because like any proofreader, this system isn't perfect.</p>
<p>Another major aspect of this is telomere length. Telomeres are long repetitive sequences at the end of each chromosome. Think of them like the taped end of a shoelace - they're a protective end cap that prevents any damage at the ends from reaching the important information in the DNA. Telomeres shorten each time a cell replicates (just because of the mechanisms of how DNA replicates), unless they are re-elongated by telomerase.</p>
<p>Telomeres have a critical point where, when they get too short they trigger cellular senesces. Basically a series of proteins are made that prevent the cell from replicating and it either sits there or dies (I mean, eventually it dies). This process is more likely to be responsible for short life in cloned organisms than the random mutation mentioned above.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

My thought is that maybe one day medicine will have advanced enough to repair dna errors if you have a good copy of your code to compare it with. Or have the option to clone myself with youthful DNA.</p>
<p>I figure worse case scenario I lose a few hundred bucks. Anyone think I have anything solid for this?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
