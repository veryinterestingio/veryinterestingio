		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey. I’m posting because 8 hours later I still don’t see the correct answer. I’m an astrophysicist. </p>
<p>Stars form out of collapsing clouds of gas. The gas clouds have some net rotation, which is enhanced as it collapses because angular momentum is conserved. This means that gas and dust particles preferentially collide and cancel out their vertical velocities, but not their rotational velocities. So the gas forms a disk circling the protostar. Friction within the disk bleeds off momentum from the gas and dust and it falls onto the star over millions of years. </p>
<p>Once the gas has fallen onto the star, it is supported by the outward pressure of the heat and light coming from the energy produced by nuclear fusion in the star’s core. This resists further collapse. The star is therefore spherical because this outward pressure is the same in all directions. Even after the star runs out of fuel and becomes an inert core, it will still be spherical because it will be supported by electron degeneracy pressure (if a white dwarf) or neutron degeneracy pressure (if a neutron star); basically these subatomic particles resist being squeezed too much unless the pressure is large enough to change their fundamental state. Note that stars do rotate, which actually means they are ellipsoidal, not perfectly spherical, because centrifugal force stretches them out a bit depending on the rotation speed. </p>
<p>Planets form from the accretion disk around the protostar. There’s some debate about how planets form exactly, but regardless of the mechanism(s), we end up with material that is mostly spherical once it is large enough. The reason is that surface gravity increases as the protoplanet grows, and so irregular/non spherical features will tend to fall “downhill”. On earth we have mountains, but if you made the mountains taller, they would erode faster. So earth remains mostly spherical. Gas planets are smoother since there’s less resistance to reaching this “hydrostatic equilibrium”. Note that planets are also often ellipsoidal because they can bulge from their rotation. This is extreme on Jupiter which is about 10% wider than it is tall. </p>
<p>Galaxies are completely difference beasts because they are mostly empty space. The most common theory of Galaxy formation says that dark matter clumps grew through gravity creating spherical “halos” that are dense in the center and less dense on the outsides. Dark matter is mysterious but we understand that it feels and produces gravity but NOT the electromagnetic force; this means that dark matter cannot collide with anything. As a result, DM halos are a whirl of dark matter flying every which way.</p>
<p>So why then are (some) galaxies disks? The answer is that you are focusing on the visible stuff. The milky way’s DM halo is mostly spherical. But the baryons are concentrated in a disk for the same reason as in the case of the protostar: gas preferentially collides and cancels out its velocity vertically, leaving it in a disk plane, where collisions are minimized due to the ordered motion. Stars form out of clouds that collapse within the densest regions of gas in the disk plane, and therefore the galaxy’s stars are found in this flat(ish) plane. But, unlike the gas, once stars are formed there’s nothing to hold them in the plane. So over billions of years, random gravitational perturbations from other stars, gas clouds, or galactic collisions will “puff up” a stellar population. Newly formed stars (&lt; about 1 billion years old) are usually found very close to the galactic plane where they were born (“thin disk stars”) whereas older ones are found in the “thick disk”, like the Sun (4.6 billion years old). </p>
<p>But if galaxies encounter other big galaxies they can undergo major mergers that end up dynamically exciting all the stars, and driving the gas inwards, or outwards, or just heating it up. When this happens, you can get an elliptical galaxy, which is often not very flat. Because there is no longer ordered motion, gas can’t concentrate enough to collapse to form stars; it’s too “hot”. And so these older galaxies, often found in galaxy clusters where mergers are common, are said to have “quenched” (ended) star formation. They look redder in color, because essentially the only blue stars in galaxies are young ones. We often call old galaxies “red and dead.”</p>
