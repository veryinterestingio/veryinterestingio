		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. Depends. But yes. </p>
<p>Most places treat the water so that it is clean enough to drink* and dump it back into the watershed. This is because people tend to get upset about the idea of drinking toilet water, regardless of how much it has been cleaned. </p>
<p>A few places where water is becoming scarce, like parts of California, are recycling cleaned water directly back into reservoirs for use. People are not entirely happy about it but hey, drought. Deal with it. </p>
<p>Ultimately, though, all water is recycled. That's kind of the whole water cycle thing. Water used upstream gets used again downstream. Water in the ocean evaporates and ends up back upstream.</p>
<p>Edit: u/garysai made a good point. I should have said that the water isn't made clean enough to drink, it's made as clean or cleaner than it was when it was pulled from the watershed to be used the first time. So, if you're getting your water from a river, the water going back into the river is at least that clean.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify, several of the posts say wastewater plants clean up water to drinking water quality.  That is usually not the case. Discharge limits are typically set so that the there is minimal, non-detrimental impact to the receiving waters but the discharge would not meet drinking water standards.  In some areas where water supplies are extremely limited, there have been wastewater plants set up to produce drinking water, Singapore for example.  Source-40 years in water treatment in US.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on where you live to how the sewage is treated, if at all.</p>
<p>But yeah, generally speaking sewage treatment plants will pump out cleaner water than they take in and it <em>can be</em> used as drinking water or for use in agriculture etc. Most commonly it'll go into a river, lake or the ocean though I guess and the waste product can be used a fuel, fertilizer or go to landfill.</p>
<p>It's filtered and chemically treated, sometimes disinfected with UV lights and chlorine etc.</p>
<p>Some states don't allow reclaimed water to be used for drinking water or for recreation like swimming pools etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but typically not in your own home. Used water flows out of your house and into the wild, then into a reservoir of water treatment. The water is first treated by a chemical process that filters out big chunks of waste and causes them to clot together, then the water gets filtered for smaller things. The water then gets disinfected which kills bacteria in it. This water then goes to be stored in towers etc and is reused for other peoples drinking water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
