		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Difficult to say. A character could have thousands of moving points, all working together through calculations. There could be quite a few reasons why those calculations don’t add up at that point. </p>
<p>Maybe there’s an undividable number for some reason, some programming languages have floating point errors (weird bug where the result of a calculation is actually incorrect), but also simple human errors. </p>
<p>Especially in an open world where literally everything can influence the character’s movement, it’s impossible to cover every single thing. It’s also impossible to test every single thing, because very often it’s not a single action that causes a bug, but a string of subsequent actions.</p>
<p>For simplification, imagine having 10 buttons, and 10 times you can press any button. That gives you 10^10 = 10 billion possibilities. That’s just 10 buttons and 10 actions. A game can have thousands of ‘buttons’ (things to interact with) and in theory an unlimited amount of subsequent actions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are lots of possible causes, but one is called an &quot;inverse kinematics&quot; glitch, the program is supposed to put someone's foot in the right place, and work out on the fly how to make everything else move so that it ends up working. But if it gets that starting place <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prJUQ3O95Go" target="_blank">wrong</a>, then it can treat the parts of their body not like a real body, but like clouds surrounding bones that are like links of a chain that it's trying to tidy up into a line, even though there's not enough room to do that properly. So they end up overlapping with themselves and looking weird.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Long story short is that somehow somewhere a mistake is made.</p>
<p>Typically it involves some failure for the model of the character and the math that determines how it behaves to cooperate.</p>
<p>Most of these are some form of collision error.  Basically things touching in ways they aren't supposed to.</p>
<p>If it's falling through the floor that is either the floor not realizing it is supposed to be keeping the player out or the player character not realizing there is a solid surface beneath it.  Similar with walls.  Many things can cause this but the most common is some form of oversight where the floor isn't as whole as it should be.</p>
<p>The vibration thing is probably two different positions sort of 'arguing' where the character is meant to stand.  In certain situations a character can be in a position they aren't supposed to be and the game cannot get them out, sort of forcing the game to bounce them between the play area and out of bounds</p>
<p>As for the weird stretching that is probably the game having issues where different parts of the character model being in different places than intended.  The character is a bunch of number points so when the points aren't where they are supposed to be anything attached to them becomes warped.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Programmers usually program rules for how things act and move instead of programming every little detail.</p>
<p>If there's even small inaccuracies in the rules, our human brains notice pretty quickly. If they're not too bad, they usually aren't high enough priority to fix before the game goes out the door and that's when we see them</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
