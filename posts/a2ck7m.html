		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR - listening to microbiology podcast episode, microbiologist+podcaster mentioned [bad] microbes being originally believed to be supernatural/demons [with no knowledge of good microbes, or microbes at all], I recalled that microevolution is observable, people deny macroevolution for lack of contemporary observability, supernatural belief is generally pitted against macro scale evolution (stating that we &quot;can't observe&quot; it), our body has a microbiome which contributes to certain fundamental biological aspects/functions,etc., this sounds to me like potential observable evidence of evolution in humans+other animals.</p>
<p>â€¢</p>
<p>I was just thinking about this listening to the microbiology episode of the <a href="https://play.google.com/music/m/Do5qkvw4zqharivbytrogrxzjqu?t=Microbiology_GUT_BIOME_with_Elaine_Hsiao_-_Ologies" target="_blank">Ologies podcast</a> and it got me thinking about our understanding of evolution starting at the micro scale in relation to supernatural beliefs. Bare with me.</p>
<p>Specifically, I was thinking about how she mentioned that the English word &quot;bug&quot; (in reference to bacteria/microbial bugs) comes from a Welsh word for ghost or evil spirit. It reminded me of a few weeks ago when I was listening to Joe Rogan speaking to someone (I think it was Elon Musk) and they were mentioning how we have the problem of making new antibiotics and vaccines every year because microbial bugs continue to adapt to the treatments and evolve into newer, stronger bugs. I.e., some of them &quot;superbugs&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Edit: the microbiologist she was interviewing also spoke about how changing the gut bacteria in mice (among other animals) made them behave differently. Would that possibly indicate something in relation to humans?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Edit 2: Also was reminded that up to 90% of our serotonin is produced by gut bacteria, so the state of our microbiome obviously plays an integral role in our general state of being and our behavior.</strong></p>
<p>An example I think about all the time, for those who don't know, is saying the phrase &quot;bless you&quot; or &quot;God bless you&quot; after a person sneezes which stems from people once believing that sneezing was our soul getting rid of evil spirits/demons in our body, or another origin stating that a Pope thought people were dying (or something of the likes) when they coughed and sneezed so this short blessing would protect them. And centuries later, even tho we understand allergies and inhaling dust and mucus production and the common cold, etc. is not demons or deadly, most people still say &quot;[God] bless you&quot; after a person sneezes.</p>
<p>And if anyone here happens to have played God of War you might remember when Sindri tells you that Freya discovered &quot;little beasties&quot; (microbes/bacteria) on everything lol, and said they were responsible for human sickness. Just a funny reference to how people once did believe microbes and their effects on us was a supernatural matter.</p>
<p><strong>My point in emphasizing our understanding, or lackthereof, during that part of history is that supernatural beliefs are generally pitted against biological evolution. But the irony is that what once was considered a supernatural phenomenon by those fundamentally against evolution, now seems to serve as clear <em>evidence</em> of evolution.</strong></p>
<p>It seems like people subconsciously think less objectively, or less overall, about the matter or just deny whatever they're told, but somehow many people will still consciously accept what we've learned from the matter.</p></div></div>

<p>up to 90% of our serotonin is produced by gut bacteria, so the state of our microbiome obviously plays an integral role in our general state of being and our behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our gut produces serotonin naturally (enterochromaffin cells), even without bacteria. The function of this serotonin is only to stimulate peristalsis (smooth muscle contraction) to move bolus along the digestive tract. It does not affect our behavior. Serotonin cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, therefore it cannot affect our brain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I recalled that microevolution is observable, people deny macroevolution for lack of contemporary observability,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My understanding from reading <a href="https://www.icr.org/" target="_blank">The Institute for Creation Research</a> is that creationists fall into two camps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Those who acknowledge microevolution, but consider it &quot;devolution&quot;. In other words, genetic mutations can only reduce the fitness of an organism, or produce disease. It cannot functionally improve an organism.</p>
</li>
<li>Those who deny microevolution. They claim that antibiotic-resistant bacteria have always existed (which is probably <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/presspacs/2013/acs-presspac-march-6-2013/resurrection-of-3-billion-year-old-antibiotic-resistance-proteins.html" target="_blank">true</a>), and is only becoming more common lately because we are killing the non-resistant bacteria, thus opening up the habitat for resistant bacteria to proliferate.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The term microevolution come from creationist thinking in order to explain the variance we see while keeping the genesis story intact.  Most scientists will just use the term evolution because there is no difference in mechanism between &quot;micro&quot; and &quot;macro&quot; evolution.  Only scale. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have observed microevolution in a variety of contexts, including in the gut of various animals (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2664199/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2664199/</a>). This depends on a lot of different factors but diet, availability, etc. are partial driving influences. But this may be a difficult argument to use with people that don't believe in evolution because there is no &quot;large&quot; change. That is, that a bacteria permanently adapts it's enzymatic processes for the type of resources that are available is a bit of an abstract idea that some people might not understand or think is relevant.</p>
<p>I like using Darwin's finches as an observable example. They are very similar birds that have very different beaks. Some to break shells and nuts, some to dig and burrow, some for insects. It's easy to see and to interpret.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
