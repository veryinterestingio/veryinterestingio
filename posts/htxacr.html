		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most helicopters have gas turbine engines (some smaller ones have piston engines, though).  In a gas turbine engine, the hot parts of the engine are always hot and the cold parts always cold while the engine is running.  For the parts of the engine that get hot when running, they wear out fastest, and need to be checked for damage and replaced/repaired most often.  Two factors are important in the lifetime of the hot parts of the engine: total running time, and number of cold-hot-cold cycles.  When the part goes from cold to hot it expands, and repeated expansion-contraction cycles can cause cracks to form.  An engine will have a certain number of start-stop cycles between major servicing, and by keeping the engine running for short stops, you are not using up an additional start-stop cycle in the engine component life.  It uses more fuel, but is overall cheaper because servicing the engine is expensive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wear on a piston engine is basically a matter of how many hours it's been operated. Wear on a turbine engine depends on that, <em>and</em> the number of on/off cycles.</p>
<p>You really see this in cropdusting aircraft, which may make a dozen flights a day...you sometimes see them refueling and reloading with the engine running.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On the ground at flat pitch, negligible amount of lift is being produced. Yea it's going to be windy, but not knock you down windy. Most will also have the option to take the engine(s) to idle to help save on fuel a little bit. </p>
<p>Depending on the helicopter, there's no danger getting in and out since the rotor system is high enough it won't hit most people, unless they do something stupid like raise their arms up or something.</p>
<p>And lastly, the amount of time it takes to load/unload is usually less time than it takes to do an engine shutdown and restart.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've seen a lot of good points here, but there are a few more that haven't been brought up yet:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The rotor blades are rather large and heavy, and moving quite quickly. Spinning them up in the first place takes considerable energy/fuel and 5-10 minutes time. Often it is more efficient to leave the helicopter idling then it is to stop the blades entirely and then restart them. </p>
</li>
<li><strong>The most dangerous time to be around a helicopter is when it is starting up or shutting down.</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>If you have ever seen a helicopter sitting parked you will notice that the blades kind of droop down when it is sitting parked.
When the blades are fully stopped they are safe. When they are fully spun up they are potentially dangerous but predictable because they stay up and out of the way (you should still duck to be safe). When the blades are being spun up or down, they can actually move above the top of the rotor and below the fully drooped position and they can do so seemingly randomly. They will easily cut through anything that gets in their way; human or otherwise.</p>
