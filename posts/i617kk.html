		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's something else to consider:</p>
<p>You're only locked out if you're trying your password on the live application, but there's no concept of being &quot;locked out&quot; if someone manages to dump a copy of the database where your password resides.</p>
<p>If an attacker manages to do that, they can try as many times as they want, as fast as they want, to crack your password, and it's under this circumstance that a cryptographically complex password will help save you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR: Hackers are actively stealing password databases to use in attacks. The simpler your password, the more likely it is to end up in the common databases.</p>
<p>The simplest way to guess passwords is to use a Brute Force Attack, you write a program that tries every single combination A, B, C, ... , AA, AB, ... etc</p>
<p>Lockouts slow down those types of attacks so much as to make them impractical.</p>
<p>Hackers today don't use Brute Force attacks anymore because they aren't efficient and too many defenses are in place. Instead they tend to rely on what are called Rainbow Tables.</p>
<p>A Rainbow Table is a pre-generated list of commonly used passwords. That narrows down the list from Billions of combinations down to just a few million.</p>
<p>They also use automated systems to perform the attacks, so called botnets. That allows the attacker to try thousands of username and password combination a minute against multiple systems simultaneously, and from different source IPs. When you attack thousands of systems simultaneously and use random combinations of known usernames + Rainbow Table Passwords sooner or later you'll get a successful hit, it's only a matter of time.</p>
<p>The catch with the Rainbow Tables is that they are generated by reverse engineering password databases stolen from big websites like Yahoo, and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Passwords are stored in website using 1 way encryption called hashing. You can't 'decrypt' a hash, you have to brute force it. You have to run combinations of possible passwords through the hashing algorithm and compare the output to the database to see if you get a successful hit. When you do you add that password to the Rainbow Table.</p>
<p>Hackers use Video card GPUs to Brute Force thousands of possible passwords against the hashing algorithm a second. This works when you have the database on your desktop, but it's impractical to use such a technique against a website.</p>
<p>Basically the simpler your password, the more likely it will end up on a Rainbow Table. Even though hackers have had databases from Yahoo and LinkedIn for years now they still haven't come close to trying every possible combination, so a lot of the most complex passwords in that database haven't been cracked yet.</p>
<p>Meanwhile things like 'password' and '12345' were cracked in the first 10 seconds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so, I see lots of answers here not addressing the OP...</p>
<p>Basically, a 4 digit PIN is easy to brute force. Like stupid easy.</p>
<p>The reasons that a lockout happens is to prevent this.. you get 3 out of 10k possibilities, which is really bad odds.</p>
<p>The complex password is there as a backup because once you get through your initial failures, it changes to &quot;as many tries as you want at the hard password&quot;, but the hard password can be really hard. (See &quot;diceware&quot;).</p>
<p>Essentially, it is to protect the relative &quot;weakness&quot; of the pin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
