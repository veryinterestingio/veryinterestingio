All skin is opaque to UV, but darker-skinned people have more of a chemical called melanin that absorbs UV instead of the other biological molecules located in the skin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The damage is caused by invisible light in the ultraviolet range. The melanin in the skin is really good at absorbing UV which stops its harmful effects. The darkening in the visible range is only a side effect and serves no purpose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>so to answer your question i have to first explain about melanin</p>
<p>Melanin is a chemical compound which gives a human being their colour ..........its produced so we can defend ourselves from the harmful uv rays of the sun</p>
<p>Darker tonned people have a lot of Melanin so thereby more protection from the uv rays </p>
<p>Lighter tonned people have very less melanin so thereby less protection from the uv rays</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The lightness of the skin doesn't really protect all that much, as you don't reflect a lot, especially in the UV spectrum. People with darker skin have more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanin" target="_blank">Melanin</a> which accumulates in special parts around the skin cells and has the special property of being able to block out UV light (which is actually what damages your cells).</p>
<p>It does have downsides though: with darker skin you heat up more, and your body can synthesize less Vitamin D.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's actually a fascinating correlation between darker skinned people living closer to the equator and lighter skinned people living further away from it.</p>
<p>Dark skin resists sun damage better than light skin, so people with darker skin can better survive in the sunniest climates, but in cloudier regions to the north where there's less sunlight, people with darker skin can't synthesize as much vitamin D as lighter skin people can.</p>
<p>Dark skin vs light skin serves a totally logical purpose and is a natural adaptation to climate. It's insane how humans get so heated about something that makes perfect sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
