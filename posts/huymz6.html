When you vent youâ€™re putting it into words AND getting emotional support, so your higher cognitive function is getting more active.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not from a medical or scientific background but I am from a therapy and counselling background.</p>
<p>The sense of relief is the negative emotions that were affecting you being processed through you talking about and experiencing our emotions.</p>
<p>To put it more simply, when we experience our emotions instead of running away from them, they usually go away by themselves.</p>
<p>Sure anxiety might be a component, especially if it's something you're holding in because you're ashamed of being depressed, but with your wordings I don't think shame and guilt are the key components that are stopping you from experiencing your emotions.</p>
<p>That's why talking about your feelings (whether with understanding friends or therapists) help so much. The alternative is to experience those emotions alone through asking yourself what you're feeling and experiencing the bodily sensations that come with said emotions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another part of the answer comes from neurobiology. Our right brain hemisphere records emotions: how we felt because of an event, everything your body and senses recorded. </p>
<p>But not the explanation of the experience. Only the left brain hemisphere can interpret and make sens of it. By talking, by using language and telling someone about it, you literally put words to it, allowing the left brain to reconcile the experience with the left brain.</p>
<p>Once both memories, the implicit (right, emotions) and explicit (left, language), are in sych, you have processed the memory and this allows you to move on.</p>
<p>Many forms of counseling is based on that principle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't give you the biology but muscles store tension over stress. That's where back issues come from the most part. Anyway, you're tapping in to the tense part within your body, which your mind pairs with a specific stressor. If you gave that stressor instead of running from it then typically your nervous system will release the tension stored.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
