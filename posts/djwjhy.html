	<title>When the end of a garden hose is oscillated, the water will make curves in the air. If a laser pointer oscillated fast enough and you had a camera quick enough, would the resulting image show the light behaving similar to the water?</title>

The velocity of the light from the laser cannot surpass C, but (assuming light as a particle?) will the direction of the protruding light follow the direction of the sum of the velocity of light and the translational velocity of the laser pointer? This is similar to the 'Turn your headlights on while driving near light-speed' question, but I think different because the velocity added is perpendicular rather than in the same direction.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The water flying through the air isn't actually curving.  You're just looking at a bunch of individual bits of water moving at their own trajectory which creates the shape of a curve.  If you track one section of water you will see it fly out in a line straight from where the hose ejected it while falling to the ground.</p>
<p>Your laser pointer would act the same way.  You would get the same appearance of a curvy wave of light (assuming there are particles along the way for the light to bounce off of and reflect back to you,) but if you looked at the path of an single section you would see it moving out (at c) in a straight line from where the pointer emitted it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The effect is known as the <em>aberration of light</em> or <em>relativistic beaming</em>. The apparent direction of light will change due to relative motion of the source and viewer, resulting in the apparent position of the light source changing.</p>
<p>(By the principle of relativity, it doesn't matter whether you regard yourself as stationary and the light source as moving, or vice versa).</p>
<p>Earth's orbital motion around the Sun is fast enough to produce a measurable shift in the apparent positions of the stars, of around 20 arc seconds. (This is much greater than stellar parallax.) This is how the effect was first discovered.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>you would have to oscillate at an incredibly high rate or see things from an extremely large (cosmic) scale.  Lateral displacement would have to be quicker than the time for light to cover the distance of view.  Otherwise, there would be no apparent bending to the line (the &quot;particle&quot; would be out of frame before any trailing particles would seem to be out of alignment).</p>
<p>The waveform only appears because particles in transit are not in a straight line.  New &quot;particles&quot; have to enter the stream before the early particles are gone for that non-linearity (continuous lateral displacement) to be evident.  Light moves too fast over short distances to allow that to happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
