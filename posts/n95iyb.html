		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a psychological condition where a person uncontrollably imagines things. This can be sounds (they might hear people telling them things even when there's nobody around, or when nobody's talking to them), sights (they might hallucinate things that aren't really there, or things which <em>are</em> there but which... aren't the way everyone else sees them). It might affect a person's ability to speak and communicate - a person can have a speaking disorder, or they might speak in really flowery, bombastic ways that people don't normally talk in (but their message is clear, just strange), or they might speak in absolute nonsense to those around them.</p>
<p>Sometimes it results in violent tendencies - a person might think they're being chased by someone or some<em>thing</em> and act out in defense, but... they're acting out against this perceived thing, not a real thing. </p>
<p>A person with schizophrenia might also show behaviors common to other disorders like clinical depression (neglecting personal hygiene, losing interest in things they used to care about), they might get agitated really easily or act erratically. </p>
<p>It's not something that can be cured, but it can be managed with therapy and medication.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Schizophrenia is essentially a serious condition where people experience their imagination as real.</p>
<p>As a result they may see or hear things that aren't there (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs that have no basis in reality (delusions), this makes them very frightened, mistrusting (paranoid), socially isolated, open to abuse and discrimination.</p>
<p>There are other things that come with  schizophrenia, like a person may not be able to move their body properly (ataxia) or be able to talk properly (their words become scrambled) in extreme cases they may stop moving and talking altogether.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief schizophrenics are not dangerous. Schizophrenia is also manageable, with proper medication and proper support schizophrenics can often lead normal, happy, productive lives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the simplest explanation is a mental illness where people are unable to distinguish between reality and fantasy. They often have internal experiences (visual and/or auditory hallucinations, etc.) that seem quite real to them.</p>
<p>There are also other symptoms that go along with it, but this is the simplest explanation.</p>
<p>The prefix &quot;schizo&quot; (think schism) means break, as in break from reality.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Schizophrenia is a brain disorder that most often presents as paranoid delusions and auditory hallucinations. The cause/s are still somewhat unknown, although I recently read a paper that suggested it had something to do with the brain ‘stuttering’ and creating a sort of positive feedback loop when presented with stimuli. </p>
<p>In other words, if you see a shadow on the periphery of your vision, a healthy brain will recognize the stimuli, quickly process it as a shadow/blob/unknown object of no concern, and move on to processing other stimuli. You will probably not even notice it. A schizophrenic brain will recognize the stimuli, process the blob, process it again, process it again, and each time the stimuli can become more distorted as the brain gets caught up on trying to figure out what it is. This is why it can be so easy to think a shadow is a person when it’s just a shadow, especially at night or if you’re already stressed. This happens to everyone (ever watched a horror movie and then every normal noise you hear that night is a potential home intruder?) because making sense of stimuli is your brains job, but in schizophrenic people it can go so far as to create things that aren’t there because the brain over processes the stimuli. </p>
<p>You can be schizophrenic and have mostly benign symptoms, but for some people schizophrenia can be very disabling, especially if they lose the ability to separate hallucinations from reality. </p>
<p>My doctor suggested I may be schizophrenic because I have auditory hallucinations and my narcolepsy study came back negative, but other than being a bit jumpy, having a stupid fear of the dark, and benign auditory hallucinations, it doesn’t cause me any suffering if I do. Many people with schizophrenia or who are at risk for it probably don’t even know it because media has told us that all schizophrenic people are crazy or dangerous, and that’s not true at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
