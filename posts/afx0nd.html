<p>A flu shot is a vaccine, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the reason for this</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CDC has addressed some misconceptions:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What about people who get a seasonal flu vaccine and still get sick with flu symptoms?</p>
<p>There are several reasons why someone might get a flu symptoms, even after they have been vaccinated against flu.</p>
<ul>
<li>One reason is that some people can become ill from other respiratory viruses besides flu such as rhinoviruses, which are associated with the common cold, cause symptoms similar to flu, and also spread and cause illness during the flu season. The flu vaccine only protects against influenza, not other illnesses.</li>
<li>Another explanation is that it is possible to be exposed to influenza viruses, which cause the flu, shortly before getting vaccinated or during the two-week period after vaccination that it takes the body to develop immune protection. This exposure may result in a person becoming ill with flu before protection from the vaccine takes effect.</li>
<li>A third reason why some people may experience flu like symptoms despite getting vaccinated is that they may have been exposed to a flu virus that is very different from the viruses the vaccine is designed to protect against. The ability of a flu vaccine to protect a person depends largely on the similarity or “match” between the viruses selected to make the vaccine and those spreading and causing illness. There are many different flu viruses that spread and cause illness among people. For more information, see Influenza (Flu) Viruses.</li>
<li>The final explanation for experiencing flu symptoms after vaccination is that the flu vaccine can vary in how well it works and some people who get vaccinated may still get sick.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>are flu shots really that important?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the flu vs flu shot answers this the best:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Is it better to get the flu than the flu vaccine?</p>
<p>No. Flu can be a serious disease, particularly among young children, older adults, and people with certain chronic health conditions, such as asthma, heart disease or diabetes. Any flu infection can carry a risk of serious complications, hospitalization or death, even among otherwise healthy children and adults. Therefore, getting vaccinated is a safer choice than risking illness to obtain immune protection.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, the flu vaccine is not guaranteed to contain the strains that happen to infect you. The vaccine contains the strains that are predicted to be most prevalent in that year, and work on these predictions begins the previous flu season and that process is complicated stuff that's probably beyond the scope of what you care to know. This means that these predictions are for a year out, and in that year new mutations may occur, so getting the flu shot does not guarantee you don't get the flu.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, you should still get the shot each year, because although the shot doesn't guarantee protection against every strain you may encounter, it does give you a good chance. Also, if you get the vaccine and still get the flu, the illness is briefer and less severe than you would have suffered otherwise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
