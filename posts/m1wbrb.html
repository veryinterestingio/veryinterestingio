<p>As I understand it, after the vaccine is administered, the body produces antibodies. So why is one vaccine 60% effective and another 98% effective? Does this mean that after the administration of the former vaccine, only 60% of the patients produce antibodies? </p>
<p>If so, does checking the antibody test at the appropriate time after the vaccine confirm that the person is protected and that they are in the right percentage of vaccine efficacy?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let’s say you have two different vaccine formulations; Vaccine X and Vaccine Y, and you want to test how effective they are. </p>
<p>To test the vaccines, you give 1000 people vaccine X, another 1000 people Vaccine Y, and another 1000 people a placebo. The placebo is just salt water, it does nothing. </p>
<p>You follow the 3000 test subjects for a period of 6 months, and you count how many in each group get infected during that period of time.</p>
<p>Of the 1000 people who got the placebo, which does nothing, 100 of them eventually get infected with the virus. This forms the baseline against which you measure effectiveness of the vaccines. </p>
<p>Of the 1000 people who got Vaccine X, only 5 of them get infected. 5 instead of 100 is a 95% reduction in new infections compared to placebo. So the vaccine is “95% effective at preventing infection”.</p>
<p>Of the 1000 people who got Vaccine Y, only 40 of them got infected. 40 instead of 100 is a 60% reduction in new infections compared to placebo. So the vaccine is “60% effective at preventing infection”.</p>
<p>Both vaccines are clearly effective at reducing the chance that a person will get infected, but Vaccine X has proven to be more effective than Vaccine Y.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't fully understand the &quot;why&quot; part. In general, if one vaccine is more effective than another, then it either drives <em>more</em> immunity (quantity) or <em>better</em> immunity (quality) (or both). </p>
<p>The quantity part is easy to measure in principle. Antibody levels <em>can</em> be measured and compared. With the current crop of COVID vaccines, I don't know of anyone who has done an actual head-to-head comparison, though. Since antibody levels can be measured in different ways, and since even the same test might give different results in different labs, you'd really need that kind of side by side comparison to be sure. </p>
<p>What we have seen if that the mRNA and adenovirus-vectored vaccines give <em>roughly</em> similar levels of antibodies - similar to or somewhat higher than that with natural infection. What we don't know is whether that &quot;roughly&quot; is important. Even two-fold or five-fold differences can be hard to confidently measure, and may be important for protection.</p>
<p>The quality part is much harder to measure. There could be, say, a higher proportion of antibodies targeting the receptor-binding region, compared to other parts of the spike protein that are less protective. The binding affinity might be higher. The antibodies might better target the infectious configuration of the protein. They might have more cross-reactive ability. And so on - There are many ways one antibody response might be more effective than another even when they are quantitatively similar. </p>
<p>And antibodies are only part of the immune equation. At the moment, we know that antibodies are <em>sufficient</em> to protect against SARS-CoV-2, but it’s likely that T cells can also provide significant protection and we don’t have a good grasp of how important that is, and we certainly don’t have a good grasp of which vaccines drive better T cell immunity. (All the authorized vaccines do drive T cell immunity, but it's very hard to quantify this form of immunity and even harder to measure its quality.)</p>
<p>And finally, it’s still not completely clear whether the vaccines really do have different efficacy, since they were measured in different contexts, in different regions, with different variants, with different definitions of disease, and so on. There probably is some difference, but it’s probably not nearly as drastic as the raw numbers (“95% vs 70%”) make it sound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have a lot of good answers. I wanted to mention that the vaccines you are talking about report the % effectiveness <em>of preventing severe illness</em>. This does not mean you won’t become infected. It just tells you the chance that you won’t become seriously ill when you <em>do</em> get infected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two commonly confused terms here (I constantly have to remind myself). Efficacy and Effectiveness.</p>
<p>Efficacy is  the % reduction in disease incidence of a vaccinated population.  Two groups of half a million people each, one vaccinated, one not, monitored over period of time.</p>
<p>50,000 of the unvaccinated population develops the disease vs 50 of the vaccinated.  Vaccine has efficacy of &gt;99%  (it's a little more complex than that, but as an example)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Effectiveness looks at outcomes. Take the same two groups above - in this case 50,000 unvaccinated people get the disease. 10,000 are hospitalised, 500 die. Among the vaccinated population, 15,000 people get the virus (the efficacy is only 70%) - but of those 15,000 only 1000 are hospitalised, and 10 die.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a good question and requires a 2 part answer.</p>
<p>The effectiveness is based on giving a certain amount of people a vaccine and then seeing how many of those people become infected after exposure to the virus.</p>
<p>Since intentionally exposing people to a deadly virus to see if a vaccine was effective would not be safe or moral they use volunteers and a double blind study so no person in the study knows if they got the vaccine or a placebo and then they go back to their normal lives.</p>
<p>They are then tested to see if they contracted  the virus and if the vaccine was effective at preventing serious illness. If 94 people out of 100 in the group that had the vaccine and then contract the virus do not have serious illness then it is considered 94% effective.</p>
<p>It is that &quot;serious illness&quot; part that is important because even with a vaccine you can still contract the virus and only if your body recognizes it and produces enough antibodies to fight it off will the vaccine be considered effective.</p>
<p>In the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines they have a high effectiveness against specific strains meaning they generally produce a high level of antibody response so most people that get the vaccine and contract the virus will not have a serious illness.</p>
<p>There are other vaccines that have a lower effectiveness meaning a higher percentage of people in the test group may still contract the virus and have illness but they are still effective at reducing serious illness that would be life threatening and in some cases they may be more effective against a wider range of strains.</p>
<p>The CDC also monitors all vaccines in real life conditions and anyone the gets a vaccine will have that info on file and if they get Covid and end up in the hospital or report getting sick then that will also be used to determine effectiveness of a vaccine in a large population and in certain groups by race, age and other factors.</p>
