		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To keep it simple, the bug you're concerned about, the amoeba Naegleria fowleri, is only dangerous if warm fresh water splashes up your nose.</p>
<p>This amoeba is commonly found in the environment in many parts of the world, like tetanus bacteria. </p>
<p>N fowleri causes no problem for human beings unless the conditions apply which enable it to get direct access to the human body. </p>
<p>In the case of tetanus that means entering the human body via a puncture or cut. For N fowleri the amoeba needs to be deposited at the back of the nose, where it can migrate directly to the brain. </p>
<p>It doesn't spread in the environment, it's already present.</p>
<p>And it isn't contagious, there is little risk transmission from person to person. The amoeba needs to be delivered in warm fresh water to the back of the nose, easy to do if you're splashing around in affected water but otherwise there's little risk. </p>
<p>(Your shower is safe, the heat kills the bug. But one of the reasons you shouldn't turn down the temperature of your hot water cylinder at home is to prevent bugs breeding in the water.)</p>
<p>N fowleri infections are rare, there are tens of cases, not thousands or millions. And it's easy to avoid, no warm fresh water up the nose. But the downside is that this disease is mostly fatal, prevention is the only protection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>
<p>Naegleria Balamuthia and Acanthamoebae are classified as free living organisms, they can exist in pretty much all beds of fresh brackish water,
think plankton, it doesn't have to spread per se, however they need certain environmental conditions to replicate otherwise they can form cysts in unfavorable conditions, the cysts are non infectious, the strains that cause PAM and GAE are more thermophilic, preferring warmer bodies of water, so more likely to be in Southern States and Eastern coast of the USA. </p>
</li>
<li>Not from person to person; Naegleria, Balamuthia and Acanthamoebae don't have person to person transmission.</li>

There have been a handful of cases from people who used tap water from a netipot that came from an uncommonly warm underground well.
