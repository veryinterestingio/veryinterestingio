		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty much it. I searched,  but I didn't find anything that addressed my exact question.</p>
<p>It's frequently said that chimps have the intelligence of a 3 year old human. But some 3 year olds are smarter than others, just like some animals are smarter than others of the same species. So why haven't we come across a chimp with the intelligence of a 10 year old? Like...still pretty dumb, but able to fully use and comprehend written language. Is it likely that this &quot;Hawking chimp&quot; has already existed, but since we don't put forth much effort educating (most) apes we just haven't noticed? Or is there something else going on, maybe some genetic barrier preventing them from ever truly achieving sapience? I'm not expecting an ape to write an essay on Tolstoy, but it seems like as smart as we know these animals to be we should've found one that could read and comprehend, for instance, The Hungry Caterpillar as written in plain english.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One reason is that human brains and chimp brains don't work the same way, they each have evolved to adapt to their environment and needs. Human brains are built to develop language and abstraction, whereas chimp brains are better adapted to agility and other chimpy things.   </p>
<p>What this leads to is that chimps can easily get <em>really good</em> at simple tasks, but it would take a particularly special chimp to get anywhere near being able to read.<br />
On the other hand, humans need a lot of practise for even simple stuff like walking, but we're able to go much deeper and form much more complex models in our minds, which is why we can read and write, do mathematics, design machines, etc...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The human brain goes through some quite interesting milestones as it develops. To start off with it's basically identical to a mid-range animal brain - hence why babies are dumb as shit. Towards about age 4, it first develops an ability called Theory of Mind, which is a set of skills that allow it to understand that other creatures perceive the world differently to itself. This can be demonstrated quite well by <a href="https://youtu.be/YGSj2zY2OEM" target="_blank">tests</a>. Here, the child named Alfie is demonstrating theory of mind when he says that he thinks his mother will think the sun is a lion. A younger child would think that its mother would know it was a sun, because they do not have the theory of mind necessary to know that other people do not know the same things they know. Many animals don't have a complete theory of mind. Chimpanzees, however, <a href="https://youtu.be/BmISd0v7AdM" target="_blank">do</a>, which is a big part of why some people say they're about as smart as a 3-4 year old. </p>
<p>Theory of mind isn't a continuous effort though. For a long time, children have absolutely none of it, then over quite a short period of time, they gain the entire thing all at once. This is how developmental milestones all behave in humans, and these milestones have specific brain structures that cause them. So you have milestones like the ability to use symbols and the ability to do abstract thought, and those are steps rather than slopes as well. These steps act as basically caps on development. An animal that doesn't have the brain structures necessary for abstract thought will never gain them. You'll still have a range of intelligence within the species, but none will be able to overcome milestones they lack the structures for, so the smartest... salmon lets say, will never be smarter than a 3 year old because it won't develop a complete theory of mind. </p>
<p>These steps aren't strictly ordered though. There's nothing in particular stopping an animal from having two milestones but missing the one that comes inbetween in humans. That does make it harder to compare to humans though. If an animal can do something an 11 year old human can do but can't do something a 3 year old human can do, what's the point of comparison for that? </p>
<p>The other major difference between human brains and the brains of other animals is that we dedicate a <em>huge</em> amount of our brain power to language. This is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktkjUjcZid0" target="_blank">cognitive tradeoff theory</a>, the idea that language was such a huge advantage to us that our brains sacrificed cognitive power in other departments for the sake of becoming even better at communicating. This would mean though that even if all other aspects were the same, humans and chimpanzees would still have intelligences you can't directly compare, because it's kind of like comparing a submarine to an aeroplane - both have similar aspects like being made out of metal, but they're designed to do very different jobs. A plane would suck at diving and a submarine would suck at flying, but that's not a very useful comparison to make.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Watch &quot;Ape Genius&quot; on YouTube. It will answer your question completely. The big points are:</p>
<p>Lack of the ability to cooperate as readily as most humans. </p>
<p>Lack of a desire to be taught complex tasks, mostly due to lack of joint attention. </p>
<p>Lack of language syntax (e.g. chatting about how the weather makes you feel). </p>
<p>Lack of mental time travel (e.g. making a decision based on past experience, present circumstances, and future consequences). </p>
<p>Lack of emotional regulation. </p>
<p>A lot of the above differences are due to a prefrontal cortex (the part of your brain behind and above your eyes) that isn't nearly as large compared to humans, but it's never just about differences in brain structure. Brain structure does not equal function, but that's another story for another time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it was in Carl Sagan's book &quot;The Dragons of Eden&quot; where I first learned about Imo, a potential genius in the primate world. It's been a long time, so I may get some details wrong. Apologies.</p>
<p>Imo was a Macaca fuscata (Japanese monkey also known as the snow monkey) who lived on the island of Kōjima in an archipelago. She lived near the coast/beach. They were studied by Japanese primatologists in the 1950s who would leave them food. The other members of her tribe, would ignore food that had been dropped/covered in sand, and search for clean fruit. </p>
<p>Imo was the first to realise that sweet potatoes could be held under the water, (running fresh water was best but the sea would give a salty flavour) and the sand washed off.</p>
<p>Human researchers, watching the tribe, saw that she tried to pass this trick on to the male leaders of the tribe, who weren't interested. She was able to pass it on to her offspring though, so they were able to claim a lot of previously unavailable food.</p>
<p>Proving the first discovery wasn't a fluke, Imo also learned how to sift wheat grains out of the sand by throwing handfuls of sand and wheat into the water, then catching the wheat that floated to the top. You could argue this was her EUREKA moment.</p>
<p>Like the washing, this technique also spread. But there were too many monkeys on the island with too little wheat coming from the humans.  Competition became too fierce and the stronger monkeys would steal the collected wheat from the weaker ones, so they stopped the learned behaviour in self-preservation. The stronger ones (the jocks?) were happy to steal from the nerds, but not to do the sifting themselves. </p>
<p>Imo (or her sibling) started another innovation after the submerging of food and wheat in water - the monkeys started submerging more of their bodies in the water, and play-splashing in the ocean. They lost their fear of the water. They can swim up to half a kilometer, but they usually do not like to.</p>
<p>Lyall Watson came up with a theory (in the 1970s) called the 100th monkey effect to explain the sort of psychic Jungian group-mind as the means by which this skill propagated even to monkeys on other islands, because it never occurred to him that Imo might have used her newly found love of water to swim to a nearby island and spread the technique there. His new-agey type theory has since been debunked and discredited.</p>
<p>Imo was a genius of her kind. She used to run down to the shore when the primatologists came with their food. Which might explain why she didn't flee from poachers, who came to the island, captured and presumably killed her. Poachers often grab the snow monkeys - which can end up as food in China, where they are said to be an aphrodisiac, and for laboratory studies in countries like Holland.</p>
<p>Imo, which first washed the sand from sweet potatoes, and realised wheat floated while sand sunk, was killed by a member of the primate species homo sapiens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
