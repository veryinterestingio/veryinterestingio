		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So your skin is actually a very organised thing. It has a bunch of layers, and each layer has a job. Generally speaking, baby skin cells start at the bottom, and do one job. They grow older and move upwards, changing jobs as they go. Then they die and deflate, making a flat barrier - this is the top layer of your skin. Once these dead skin cells start to fall apart, they fall off. All these layers are held together by a web of this stuff called collagen.</p>
<p>In normal skin, the collagen fibres are in a kind of random weave that looks a bit like a 3d basket weave. Collagen is kinda stretchy, so having it in the random weave makes your skin stretchy in all directions. It also means there's plenty of space inbetween the fibres for your skin cells to move through and live in.</p>
<p>When you have a wound, your body's main priority <em>isn't</em> to recreate this complicated structure. Its main priority is to <em>close the wound as fast as possible</em>.</p>
<p>The first, super fast thing it does is it makes a scab. A scab is like a dam made of blood cells, with other fibres acting like ropes and glue to hold it all together. This is meant to be very temporary, since scabs are too stiff to be useful.</p>
<p>Once a scab is formed, your body will start stitching things up with a collagen web. It'll stich this web <em>through</em> the scab, for skin cells to attach on to. But like I said, it wants to do this <em>fast</em>. Making a collagen Web that's random and well distributed would take time. It's much faster to make all the collagen in the same direction. Collagen is also much faster to make than skin cells, so your body will make a lot of it in the healing wound. The result is a patch of skin that has much more collagen than normal skin, and has its collagen all aligned, making it much less flexible.</p>
<p>This skin will develop the same kinds of skin layers, but since stuff stacks less well, it doesn't work as well. This can have a variety of effects - the colour could be lighter or darker, the scar can be thicker or more sunken than surrounding skin, they don't protect against sunlight as well, and other stuff.</p>
<p>Many scars do gradually go away. But deep scars go away so slowly that you won't really notice much difference over a lifetime. We can deal with this in two ways. Some treatments try to prevent scarring. Many of these do so by <em>slowing down</em> healing. This buys time for more skin cells to be grown and take up space, which means the scar has less collagen in it, and is more similar to surrounding skin. This sort of treatment is mostly used for wounds where scarring would cause big problems, like eye wounds. This is because the necessary medicines aren't exactly great for you. </p>
<p>Most scar removal treatments work by actually doing small amounts of damage to the scar, spread out. Basically breaking up the collagen. This creates space for more normal skin to take its place. In these treatments, the wounds are really small, so your body won't be in such a rush to patch them up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scar is your body's attempt to heal when you're unable to replace tissue with fully functioning tissue. Scar tissue is filler material, sort of like duct tape. If your body's cells aren't able to completely replicate and replace the missing tissue with normal cells, scar tissue fills it. </p>
<p>It doesn't disappear over time because the cells that make up the scar are like non-functioning filler cells. It formed in the first place because the functioning cells couldn't replace all tissue with normal cells, so it isn't able to in the future either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human bodies do not have the ability to repair significantly traumatized slim tissue to regular tissue. Regular skin tissue appears in a “basket weave” like pattern and when it repairs it repairs in a cross stitch like pattern. This is related due to the autophagy mechanism and I believe there are very few species that have the ability to completely heal tissue back to normal after a severe trauma to the skin tissue. This must be some type of evolutionary thing</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
