		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrison_Formation#Fossil_content" target="_blank">This</a> section of the Wikipedia page on the Morrison Formation (late Jurassic) may be most constructive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though many of the Morrison Formation fossils are fragmentary, they are sufficient to provide a good picture of the flora and fauna in the Morrison Basin during the Kimmeridgian. Overall, the climate was dry, similar to a savanna but, since there were no angiosperms (grasses, flowers, and some trees), the flora was quite different. Conifers, the dominant plants of the time, were to be found with ginkgos, cycads, tree ferns, and horsetail rushes. Much of the fossilized vegetation was riparian, living along the river flood plains. Insects were very similar to modern species, with termites building 30-meter-tall (98 ft) nests. Along the rivers, there were fish, frogs, salamanders, lizards, crocodiles, turtles, pterosaurs, crayfish, clams, and mammaliforms. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, no angiosperms, and since grasses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poaceae#Evolutionary_history" target="_blank">didn't appear until 55-66 MYA</a> (depending upon what you want to call a &quot;grass&quot;), no ground cover, at least not as we know them.</p>
<p>Depending upon moisture levels, there may have been algae, lichens, bryophytes, and ferns; even here in the desert, we get ferns like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selaginella" target="_blank">Selaginella</a> that do well in drought, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_soil_crust" target="_blank">cryptogamic soil</a>.</p>
<p>Areas with more moisture might have had some mosses like sphagnum, and in the shade under conifers there could have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycopodiophyta" target="_blank">lycopods.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For prairie-like ecosystems we have a number of lines of evidence that indicate that ferns occupied a similar niche to grassland type ecosystems in the present day.  Essentially low-growing ferns instead of grasses in many areas.  Possibly also with certain types of hardy mosses and lycopodium as well.  Likely a number of small flowering plants later on as flowering plants evolved more than 145 million years ago. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Mesozoic era might also have had large, open areas with low-growing vegetation, including savannas or fern prairie with dry, nutrient poor soil populated by herbaceous plants, such as ferns of the families Matoniaceae and Gleicheniaceae.<br />

<p>The vegetational dominants of the “fern prairies” at BCR belonged to non-polypod orders, which together comprised two-thirds of pteridophyte diversity. Polypodiales, in contrast, were significant in diversity (one-third of species) but minor in biomass.<br />

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I heard a podcast from the guys who made saurian and they said, that was the hardest part, going through all the plants and how they look and how some plants aren’t classified properly so there are different names for the same plant or parts of it.
I hope you just want to do a painting because it seems that question can be a nightmare to answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
