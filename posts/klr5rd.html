		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't really a hypothetical: we already power tons of stuff in space via solar panels precisely because it works well.</p>
<p>But to answer your question: on a sunny day, somewhat, but not by a ton - the atmosphere doesn't absorb <em>that</em> much light. The bigger advantage would be, say, not having clouds in the way and it being &quot;daytime&quot; all the time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On the ground under optimal conditions a solar panel receives about 1100 W/sq m. In space that number is 1350 W/sq m. So it is somewhat more efficient. However in space you never have clouds or fog and your panels don’t need cleaned which also helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Using solar panels for satellites and spacestations is a thing we do and have done for decades.</p>
<p>You may get a slight boost in efficiency in space due to a lack of atmosphere, but that is largely irrelevant.</p>
<p>On earth we want as much power per area as we can, in space area is more or less limitless and you want something that gives you as much energy per mass.</p>
<p>We also don't tend to shoot cutting edge tech into space. By the time something ends up in space, much better and newer tech will be available on earth.</p>
<p>Another aspect is maintenence, which is much easier on earth than in space, we send up stuff that we think will last for a while out there.</p>
<p>So comparing solar panels in space and on earth regarding efficiency is not really all that useful.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind for your sci-fi story idea is that a laser will take a lot of energy over a very short amount of time while solar and most other useful energy source provide smaller amounts over a longer time. You need some way to store energy and release it quickly.</p>
<p>Google some of those high energy laser projects that for a fraction of a second use more energy than the entire planet does normally.</p>
<p>You need to come up with some sci-fi capacitor that is energy dense enough to be shot into space.</p>
<p>Arguments could be made for nuclear powered satellite weapons that would not need to be in some sun-synchrnous orbit to keep charging all the time and might present a smaller target, you would still need a capacitor though.</p>
<p>One idea that has come up in sci-fi a bit is skipping a lot of those steps and simply uses a nuclear bomb to directly fuel a laser or similar directed energy weapon. A bomb pumped laser would be a one-shot weapon but it simplifies the l&quot;ots of energy at once problem&quot; rather handily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No joke, the US Government had a “Star Wars” program in the 80s that was very close to what you described. </p>
<p>“The Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO) was set up in 1984 within the US Department of Defense to oversee development. A wide array of advanced weapon concepts, including lasers,[2][3] particle beam weapons and ground- and space-based missile systems were studied, along with various sensor, command and control, and high-performance computer systems that would be needed to control a system consisting of hundreds of combat centers and satellites spanning the entire globe and involved in a very short battle.”</p>
