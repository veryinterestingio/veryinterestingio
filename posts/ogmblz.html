<blockquote>
<p>Do they really do this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, they do.  Mostly residents do.  We typically did two 24 hours shifts per month as senior residents.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>breaks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You only got a break if things were slow enough to take a break.  If they weren't, you don't get a break.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>more susceptible to errors?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely.  It sucks, and is terrifying.  You might be trying to deal with multiple dying patients at the same time, while the stable patient down hall has some random step-daughter that is pissed because the doctor won't come answer her questions about mundane bullshit at 0130 in the morning.  Or getting pages from nurses asking &quot;is it okay to give the Tylenol that's ordered PRN?&quot;  You have to learn to triage, and parse through bullshit, and extract information from people as quickly as possible, because you're already behind, and you need re-evaluate that kid with sepsis.</p>
<p>The common explanation is that handover is one of the most dangerous parts of medicine, and that limiting handover is safer.  It's true that handover can be dangerous, but there are specific handover procedures that can help mitigate this risk.  And the longer shifts would largely be unnecessary if there were more physicians anyway.</p>
<p>But yeah, that shit is real, and it's dangerous.  If you're gonna code, don't do it at 0530 when the residents have all been working for 23.5 hours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I was in residency (residency is where you have graduated from medical school and have your MD and are now in your specialty training), if I was going to be on call, I'd arrive at the hospital at 7 am, work all that day and that night, then all the next day and leave at 6-7 pm or so.  That comes out to 35-36 hours straight.  It's not really a &quot;shift,&quot; in the sense that it begins and ends at a precise time, and you don't clock in or out, as you're not being paid by the hour.  Post-call (the day after you've worked all night), you go home when your work is done and everyone is taken care of, and you've signed out to the next person on call for all the patients under your responsibility.  Sometimes I'd get a few winks in the call room at night, which helped.  After 3 years of that every 3-4 days, I was fried.</p>
<p>As far as errors, your brain certainly works slower when you're exhausted.  I don't know of any errors I made, but I probably wasn't at my optimal level of sharpness all the time.  One thing it has done is that it has made me sleep lighter, even now, 25 years later.  In residency, you have to be able to wake up from your cat nap in the call room and be at full function right away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello! Final year resident from Europe, speciality is a branch of internal medicine. This is my program from my hospital. Our shift starts at 8 am. At 2-3 pm your &quot;on call &quot; starts. You work through the day and night. You get to sleep only if the emergency room is empty and no one needs a consult. Or if there isn't an emergency. Then the next day at 8 am the normal shift starts again and it end at 2/3 pm.
My husband's program from another hospital: his on call starts at 8 and ends at 8 am the next day. Then he continues his normal shift. His on-calls are a bit lighter, not many emergencies over night, but he usually has 7-10 on calls a month.
How do we do it? We drink coffee and energy drinks until we all develop reflux.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctor from Denmark here with a different perspective. What the other posters say with 24hr shifts and 100+ hours/wk are a symptom of a dysfunctional system. I have 45-50 hour weeks, max shifts are 17 hours (1530-0830) and I usually catch a few hours of sleep during those. I have these approx weekly. I work in the emergency department.
Sometimes during night shifts I sleep 7 hours, but that's because I now work at a major hospital. Used to work at a smaller one where I'd get 4 hours at most.</p>
<p>Edit: also I'd like to add that the &quot;less mistakes due to fewer shift changes&quot; argument is a poor argument probably made by those that made that mess/couldn't solve it in the first place. The majority of patients in the ED we only see once. Then they are moved out of the ED so you hand them over to someone else anyway. If you do have them staying in the ED we usually make a plan that lasts 24 hours so they are gonna be seen by someone else regardless. Plus you make WAY more mistakes when you don't sleep, it's like being drunk. The only argument for such shifts is a lack of other options. In my opinion anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
