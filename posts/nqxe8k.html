<p>Basically, they can inject a polymer into the tube that carries sperm and can remove it if you feel like having a baby, so more like an IUD than the pill.</p>
<p>It’s in Stage III clinical trials now, so we’ll see it at some point in our lifetimes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is both more difficult and less desirable.</p>
<p>For women, birth control works by hijacking existing hormonal cycles. Without tampering a woman's body will naturally build a lining in the uterus into which an egg can implant when fertilized. After an egg is implanted the body will react by thickening the lining to prevent more eggs from implanting. If no eggs are implanted the lining will be shed in a period to start the cycle over again.</p>
<p>Birth control uses the natural hormonal signals to thicken the existing lining before any eggs can be implanted, and then letting off the hormones to allow a period. Because the thickening hormones were active throughout the cycle the periods are typically lighter, and the hormones are more stable. For many women this means less hormonal side effects such as PMS and a less painful period, so they would desire to take birth control regardless of its contraceptive effects!</p>
<p>In contrast male birth control would need to find a way to prevent the formation of sperm and/or prevent them leaving the body. Unfortunately there isn't any natural cycle to hijack; men are adapted to making sperm constantly and expelling them as needed. If they aren't used the body will even purge the old ones reflexively! A simple hormone to stop men making sperm isn't something that is immediately evident and may simply not exist. Furthermore men do not in general experience any undesirable side effects from the production of sperm, so there are no anti-PMS or less painful period benefits to be had.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Women naturally have a &quot;turned off&quot; state in pregnancy, which pauses your normal period cycle and release of eggs. Most female birth controls are designed to take advantage of pregnancy hormones and trick the body. Similar to an actual pregnancy, things can restart once the body comes back to normal.</p>
<p>Men on the other hand continually produce sperm. There's no such toggle built in there. So male birth control has to get creative to be effective yet avoid long-term effects. A few do exist now and haven't been shown to be much worse than female BC, but it's harder for them to get approved for public use.</p>
<p>There's also a lot of situational bias at play too; it's not as if the issue exists in a vacuum. Female birth control, despite its side effects, is a high priority to keep on the market due to its medical necessity for many people; male BC doesn't have that edge. Men that don't want children already have a simpler, safer and more reversible surgical BC option than women (vasectomy), lessening the necessity by another step. And just culturally male BC has way more of an uphill battle right now since it showed up late and goes against the current social norms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The male hormonal birth control that exist right now are generally using MPA as the main effector. This drug is more commonly known to be the drug they use for chemical castration. It's not an off switch for sperm production or fertility, its an off switch for the entire testicle. MPA alone has the effect of destroying libido, decreasing muscle mass and even causing dangerous mood swings, not to mention that if taken for long enough, the effects can become somewhat permanent. To offset the immediate effects, pharmaceutical companies will try including other hormones or just straight up steroids. Often causing more problems and further complications after the drug is stopped.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
