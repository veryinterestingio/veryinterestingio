		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The principle was to keep the definition consistent with previous measurements, within their uncertainty. We already had a definition for the metre, just not as precise as the current definition, and we want the new definition to be as consistent as possible, but just easier to measure precisely. Rounding to 300,000 km/s would change the definition of the metre by about 0.07%. That would just make life different for everybody: we'd have to specify if we're talking about the &quot;old&quot; metre or the &quot;new&quot; metre, because that 0.07% change is big enough to matter. It'd change the circumference of the Earth by about 30 km, for instance - a big enough difference that it's measurable, even if it's small.</p>
<p>Rounding down to the nearest 1 m/s means that instead of a 0.07% change, the change is ~0.0000003% at most. So, that changes the circumference of the Earth by &lt;10 cm at most. That's small enough that it would typically be within the measurement error, and it's close enough that we can treat the metre as unchanged without causing any problems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The meter <del>is</del> was defined as 1/10,000,000 the distance from the equator to the North Pole at the longitude of Lyon.</p>
<p>Then people figured out that this wasn't a great way of developing a precise unit of length due to difficulty measuring, and the fact that the value might even change due to Earthquakes, and it could only be referenced at one spot (the line through Lyon) and they searched for a definition that was a universal constant. Eventually the speed of light was chosen (there were electrum rod references in between), and it happened to be 299,792,458. It's a pure fluke that it's so close to 300,000,000</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The goal was to define the meter using constants, not redefine the meter itself. So, the people who defined it said &quot;how long does it take light to travel one meter in a vacuum?&quot; and did the math. Light will travel that distance anywhere in the Universe, so the definition is now not subject to change unless we are measuring the speed of light incorrectly. If we used some other metric, like a distance on Earth, that distance is subject to tectonic adjustments and is not quite as constant, plus it can't be derived on other planets (not that that matters right now).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The meter was originally defined in the late 18th century as 1 / 10 000 000th of the distance between the equator and the north pole. The definition as a fraction of a light year was later adopted in 1983 so it would depend on a constant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
