		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One that no one is mentioning is potentially the most likely and damaging.  BGP is the protocol that handles routing on the internet and is what enables the internet to be decentralized.  BGP is largely trust based, and there have been cases of companies saying they “own” IPs that they do not.  There have been several instances of countries trying to censor sites like YouTube. Generally this is done by “black holing” IP subnets. So for example, in that country, all traffic destined to You Tube would simply be discarded and your request would never make it to YouTube.  Since BGP propogates routes automatically and is latgely trust based, there have been times where these “null routes” escape from the country they are meant for, and impact global traffic.</p>
<p>There are of course many mitigations to this, but its conceivable that a specially crafted BGP hijack could significantly disrupt global traffic (as has already happened several times over the years).  I would definitely say BGP is right now the achilles hell of the internet, much more so than DNS (its just that many non-networking folks have likely never heard of it, while many people are aware of DNS)</p>
<p>Speaking of DNS, another risk to worry about is a DNS hijack(which are generally much less impactful than BGP hijacks), discussed in some other posts.  We are starting to see more of these schemes (sometimes in conjunction with a BGP hijack to point endusers DNS traffic to nefarious servers), and sometimes these schemes are designed to steal cryptocurrency.  As there is money in this, I would expect to see more and more of these types of attacks, especially if crypto prices go back up.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A very large Coronal Mass Ejection during a period of low magnetic field could conseivably knock out most or all of the internet. Similarly, large scale coordinated EMP attack could do a similar thing. Those are my best ideas, obviously both are hardware focussed I'm not sure if there are possible software solutions that could take down the entire internet, but it seems like it would be extremely challenging to achieve that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a serious cause of concern for people in the field. </p>
<p>For regular people, the main concern is attacks against the DNS infrastructure.<br />
The internet doesn't know what to do with &quot;google.com&quot;, so when we want to go there we actually make two requests. One goes to your DNS server and one goes to the IP returned from it (Google's IP in this case).<br />
Turns out this system is fairly vulnerable.   </p>
<p>Such an attack was carried out a while back against Dyn by using a botnet. And resulted in a great deal of servers being inaccessible. It was facilitated by insecure IoT devices.</p>
<p>Beyond that probably the greatest threat is state actors. Look at Stuxnet for some nightmare fuel stuff. If such sophisticated malware is created and used against the internet infrastructure we are well and truly boned.   </p>
<p>But no, due to the way the internet is designed no one event can bring it all down. Cutting the transatlantic cables would screw us but the internet would remain intact, albeit severely reduced in capacity between the two continents.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The internet core routers that build up the internet come from a very small group of suppliers (many brands are actually resellers). I think the biggest threat would be if a hostile group managed to sneak in malicious code into these suppliers' software and launch a synchronized attack. </p>
<p>Second biggest threat would probably be if someone finds a massive problem in BGP.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
