		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most common hypothesis seems to be that its what happens when your body abruptly redirects blood flow from your stomach/digestive system to your muscles while you were in the middle of digesting food. Basically, your body is abruptly changing priorities from &quot;Rest and Digest&quot; to &quot;Fight or Flight&quot; and the switchover leaves certain things in a less than ideal state, which causes pain. This would explain why not eating too soon before exercise can help prevent them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>Fellow stitch runner here. I ran a lot when I was in highschool and always (always always) got a stitch when doing so. Sometimes it would happen 30 seconds in, sometimes it would happen 5 minutes in. As longer as I ran for more than that, I'd get one. I experimented with breathing techniques, when I ate, what I ate. Nothing changed the fact that I got one. Until one day (many years after highachool) I ran with a stomach ache. I discovered a way for myself (not saying this will work for everybody) to prevent a stitch almost indefinitely. When I run, my abs are tensed by default. It isn't something I did consiously, but it was automatic. However, i tried relaxing my abdomenal muscles (which wasn't easy since they would go back into the flexed state as soon as I stop thinking about it) and it freaking worked to prevent a stitch! Now, when I run (which is much less often) I never get stitches so long as I relax my abdomenal muscles. It's absolutely crazy that something so simple could have prevented hundreds of hours of pain, haha. Try is out. if you're having difficulty relaxing the muscles, push your stomach out. Not saying it's going to work, but it's worth a shot!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
