		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you sit at home, you're completely still and the only thing youre really feeling is gravity. When you sit in a vehicle thats moving, you have turns, speed changes, etc. constantly happening, and your body has to constantly tense and relax to keep you upright. Its minor enough that you don't think about the fact that you're doing it, but enough that you're tiring yourself out.</p>
<p>If you're driving, then you have to remain alert constantly as well, your mind is constantly working because you're aware that if you lose focus you can potentially die.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s the same reason that sitting in a seat on an airplane for 10 hours is exhausting.</p>
<p>“Alertness” takes a lot of brain power and energy. New and unfamiliar situations cause your brain to maintain situational awareness of what’s going on around you more than sitting at home, where your brain can automatically “tune out” everything it already knows, like the color of the sofa and where it is in the room.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t consciously pay attention to everything going by, part of your brain is, because it’s new and unfamiliar stuff, and it can’t <em>really</em> be entirely sure you’re not about to be eaten by a leopard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a passenger, you're sitting in a box that is being violently vibrated and randomly accelerated, while being subject to high levels of noise. The same stuff that causes motion sickness also affects you when you don't get motion sick. Possibly also unpleasant sunlight and/or heat. If I had to build a machine that wears you down without getting me sent to The Hague... that's actually a pretty good design.</p>
<p>(Tip: try earplugs - not blasting music at an even higher volume level! - and see if you're less destroyed)</p>
<p>As the driver, add to all of the above the fact that you're performing a task that requires constant attention, nonstop for hours, at high speed, and where any mistake or inattentiveness even for a second or two can mean death for you and others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every 3 seconds you have to make a micro decision.  If you make the wrong micro decision, you're instantly in significant danger.  The fatigue is from a very justified anxiety.</p>
