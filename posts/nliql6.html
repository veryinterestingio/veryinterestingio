First of all, 99% of the time we’re on VHF AM, not HF AM radio like people have suggested. Second of all, the radio has nothing to to do with the intercom anyways. The real reason is weight. Good speakers are heavy and the fuel to carry those around for the life of the airplane costs thousands to millions.</p>
<p>TLDR; Good speakers are heavy and cost too much fuel to carry around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It's not worth the cost, weight, and maintenance to get better audio since there's not much benefit to it in the first place. Good audio doesn't really contribute to a good flight in a way that's worth any of the costs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>ÉDIT: thanks for all the upvotes and badges &lt;3</p>
<p>Many considerations :</p>
<ul>
<li>in aviation and aerospace we need to make sure safety related equipment are reliable. That is why multi million dollar planes are equipped with sometimes CRT screens : they don’t break at the first turbulence. Same for the intercom in the cabin : we could install Bose PA speakers but you’d need to make sure first they are designed to be fail proof. We still do check them as part of the cockpit preflight because we need to know in case we do need to announce a no-time emergency (like « emergency descent ! » or « EVACUATE ») they were at least working. I personally listen to it on my mixer to be SURE they work when I use them</li>
<li>laws : they have to follow a specific standard that is very precisely required and there must be only a handful of makers on the market, just like my plane the B737 has only two providers of autopilot controls. In particular there is a need of everything in the plane to be ignifuged to retard fire in case one breaks out. There must be design specifications for, for example, working through interferences, not breaking during a spike surge of electricity (we do connect and disconnect several time a day massive generators of 400hz 115V Ac generators from the planes or the onboard generator or external ground generators and each time a solenoid jumps and spikes can go through the electric busses and would maybe fry mainstream grade equipment)</li>
<li>money : there are certainly weigh considerations for EVERYTHING on board. This equipment is not exempt and modern grade equipment that are not designed with weigh in mind can’t find a buyer from Boeing Airbus or the new competitors. Mind you, a big American airline decided to remove 1 or 2 olives per on-board meal after the first oil price crises : they estimated it saved them half a million dollars in fuel a year. There is no little savings when it comes to weight on a plane.</li>
<li>and finally probably the most likely reason why PA speakers don’t upgrade : Certification. Every system on a plane, every sticker, is certified. Next time you go to the toilet check the stickers : they have a number somewhere that links tl their certification. Each plane is designed with specific design plans and the most basic of its structure is part of the certification. That is notably why you pretty much never have a window perfectly adjusted to your seat : they are designed by Boeing but every airline chooses the seat configuration. The cell stays the same. Now I’m not 100% sure of it, but the speakers might be tied to the plane type. When a plane is upgraded to a more modern one like the 737 which cames from 200 (legacy) to 300 (classic) to 800 (Ng) and now max (-8), at each time the manufacturer can only modify 25% of the désign or the planes is deemed needed a new certification which means a whole complete flight test campain which is extremely costly and also means pilots need to train for the new type instead of a short transition called « difference training ». Since most of this is taken by the update of the wing design, engine, systems here and there that improve fuel efficiency and comfort, a PA speaker is probably last on the list. Mind you the overhead panel controls of the max are still the same as the -200 for some parts because changing it would mean the plane needs a new certification and although it’s 2021 the max doesn’t have push buttons with lights like the new planes because companies have too many of them to want to pay for the transition. Notably Southwest pressured Boeing to not modify the overhead to a modern styled one for this reason alone. Trust me, we pilots would love a redesign of the cockpit that is old fashioned (albeit cool because of that) and noisy for a more modern and quiet one, so if those controls are not updated, the PA will be last</li>
</ul>
<p>Given all that though, each generation of planes gets better on all parameters and I would bet a B787 sounds better than a B727 in the cabin - unless the PA makers have stayed the same ?</p>
<p>TL,DR : reliability, laws, weight, R&amp;D, certification, cost to airline training due to said certification</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most commerical planes are ancient, in terms of technology. Everyone assumes they are the height of technology but there is a good chance, depending on the route (in the US at least) the plane you're flying in is 20+ years old. Many of them are designs that are even older than that. Look how long the 747 has been flying lol</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
