		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the 'flight-or-flight' response. Your body releases hormones like adrenaline which increases your heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate. This is what results in you feeling like you're panicking. All of these things increase your chances of getting out of a dangerous situation alive by either running away from or fighting off the threat.</p>
<p>Of course it's possible that someone can basically become paralysed with panic and you might think that logically it's better to stay calm and cool headed but fight or flight is usually only triggered when the situation is something unfamiliar to you. In that scenario, taking action (any kind of action) is your best bet. If it's a dangerous scenario you've faced before, you're less likely to be scared and the fight-or-flight response is less likely to be triggered and you'll remain calmer because in that scenario, you're best bet of survival is drawing on your experience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can blame evolution’s “shortest path to good enough” design philosophy. The same reason the fight-or-flight response is sometimes detrimental or fatal is the same reason sharing an airway with food is sometimes detrimental or fatal. It’s not necessarily poor design, it’s just that reality is complicated, and there are sometimes negative consequences in niche circumstances to otherwise incredibly useful or resource efficient designs or mechanisms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People usually develop better responses to panic over experience. This is true for animals too. Baby predators playfight, baby primates play with mock children or smaller animals, baby birds will learn to fly.</p>
<p>The problem is if you're an adult human theres a good chance you never needed to know how to swim and choking was never a thing you had to learn to deal with. When I once choked and almost died I was able to focus and basically did the hiemlich on myself(not fun, would not reccomend), but I had to both learn how that worked and also had been in many stressful situations previously so I was used to managing the response. If I didn't know what to do and didn't have the life experience to help me remember to think I probably would've died.</p>
<p>Which also holds true for ancient hominids. Your average caveman also had to learn and think and develop. He just had to think about things like this more directly and was taught how to handle them more directly. Thats one of the reasons humans take to long to grow up: our brain needs all that developmental time to figure out how to human, and as we evolve and adapt what that means just changes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mostly, drowning and choking has not been a major threat to human beings, so we don't have specific built in behaviours to tackle that.</p>
<p>We have generic behaviours to tackle being under threat, that increase you strength and pain tolerance. It's not always optimal, but it has been optimal sufficiently often to improve our survival rate overall (but not in every situations).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hum... chocking and drowning are life threatening that requires immediate actions.  </p>
<p>Your body may have a conflicting conversation  like :</p>
<p>Body : Yo something is wrong!<br />
Brain : yeah I am a few meters away fr...<br />
Body : YO SOMETHING IS WRONG<br />
Brain : Keep..<br />
Body : SOMETHING IS WRONG SOMETHING IS WRONG<br />
Body : WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG<br />
Body : Brrrrr  </p>
<p>Then you go full hormones and no brain.  </p>
<p>From an evolution perspective, acting like that most likely saved more than it harmed.<br />
Nowaday panicking is almost useless but thanks to our instincts we gained stress to keep it up and running.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
