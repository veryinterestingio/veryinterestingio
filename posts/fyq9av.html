		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Iridium can be machined, it's just a lot harder to do than other materials and there are much eaisier ways to form it. If you want to cut it with an endmill you are going to want a properly coated tool that has a hard coating capable of handling high temperatures - depending on your setup you might be able to do it with PCD or AlTiN tool. Most machinists would get pretty pissy if you tried to get them to run the job though, the tools just won't last that long and it will take a lot of babying, you might have to swap tools regularly before failure in the middle of a job, use very low speed/feeds, etc.</p>
<p>You can grind it, that's not a problem. Best way to cut it is probably EDM. Milling is only the &quot;worst&quot; option, not impossible. BTW grinding is not an ideal solution because the grinding tool will wear over time and it is hard to hold tolerances. Grinding can be done very precisely but will often use in-situ measuring machines to machine-measure the surface, which is costly but for example one of the best ways to form a complex lens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing I haven't seen addressed is the core of the question.</p>
<p>Grinding is just cutting. Sandpaper works because the grains on the paper are harder than the surface sanded. </p>
<p>Iridium is already an extremely stiff, and extremely hard material without being work-hardened. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there something I am not understanding about work hardening? Does work hardening affect materials at such a &quot;small-scale&quot; as sanding away tiny pieces of the material?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Work hardening is a grain-level phenomenon (crystal dislocations are distributed/created in a single grain), so I would suppose that would exponentiate your woes if you wanted to shape a piece of iridium by grinding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One issue with Zirconium for instance, is that as it gets hot, it forms a very hard oxide layer. When cutting Zirconium, slow and cool makes it a less difficult endeavor than just going at it as hard and fast as possible. I could cut Zr with a hacksaw, but my cutting mill could not bit into it more than a few millimeters due to that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are tools built specifically to machine hard as fuck things that work harden almost instantly.  Ceramic inserts coupled with high feeds and no coolant typically are the go to tools for the job.  Look on YouTube of guys milling inconel, the feedrates are insane.</p>
<p>It can be done with standard carbide tooling but youll spend a fortune on inserts and broken tools and most likely will scrap your part when the tool becomes one with it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
