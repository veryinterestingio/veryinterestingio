		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most food you eat is already moist to some degree. Think of eating lasagna. It is much more moist than a given pill. That moisture provides lubrication. We DO eat dry foods yes, but we tend to chew them up into sizes smaller than a pill. In addition; when we eat a dry food it tends to spend more time in our mouth while being chewed and the dry food absorbs some moisture (saliva.)</p>
<p>I pill is generally NOT chewed and spend little time in the mouth and has less chance to absorb lubricating saliva.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's mostly psychological. Unless you have zero saliva or it's a particularly sticky pill you shouldn't need water. The problem is we are conditioned to chew anything we eat before we swallow <em>pauses for cum jokes</em> so it feels unnatural. I have to take pills fairly often and I haven't used water in years unless the medicine prescribes to do so.</p>
<p>Edit: just want to clarify, I am not necessarily advocating not using water. If the instructions say take with water then take it with water. I am saying you shouldn't need water in the sense of actually being able to swallow the pill, which is what OP was asking about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mainly because of pill aversion. Pill aversion isnâ€™t something that everybody experiences. Symptoms could include gagging, nausea at the time of swallowing, and heavy feeling in the stomach, as well as being bothered by the taste, smell, and size of the pills. The patient will experience negative and fear-based emotions. </p>
<p>Patients could develop pill aversion for various reasons. Sometimes simply due to pill fatigue. Pill fatigue is often experienced by patients who have an illness that requires them to take a considerable amount of pills daily, eventually reaching a point of burnout and not be able to continue to take pills. </p>
<p>It could be due to a negative experience with a specific medication. For instance, if the patient was on a medication that caused heavy nausea for a period of time, they could go on to develop pill aversion. </p>
<p>This could also happen if an individual attempted to kill themselves by taking a large number of pills. I ended up going through an ambulance and was admitted to a hospital where their stomach was pumped, or they were forced to consume activated charcoal. The overall experience can lead to pill aversion. </p>
<p>Sometimes it is due to smells. If a patient has a strong sense of smell and they can smell the pills; therefore taste it without consuming it, they will also develop pill aversion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Don't sip water. DRINK water.</p>
<p>Drink it like you're downing a drink. Literally the second gulp gets the pill every time for me. Haven't had any issue since realising this 10 years ago.</p>
<p>I grew up being told to take a sip then swallow, this never worked for me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
