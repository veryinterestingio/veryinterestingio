I was talking to someone today who said that yes, you would be found at fault of insider trading. However, assuming this is correct there sounds like something is wrong, as at that point it sounds like you're sitting in front of a train and refuse to move and get hit. Is there something I'm missing? I'm not asking if you would require a lawyer or you'd have to go to court, but in the terms of the law at this point are you technically breaking the law?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the nexus of the concept of insider trading is the concept of Material Non-Public Information, or MNPI; everything else is secondary. This is a very important aspect, and the subject of most of the decisions taken by courts on insider trading cases. But what does it mean?</p>
<p>MNPI can be very varied in nature, it can be the content of a conversation, a written or digital document, etc..  </p>
<p>Lets break it down : </p>
<p>MATERIAL : an information, when talking about the stock market, is defined as material when it is relevant to the decision to buy or sell a stock, AND when it comes from a source that is privy to information that might add to the relevance or make it credible. </p>
<p>When the CEO of Railco tells you that they will announce stellar financial results, the information is material because it will very much affect the stock price, and because the CEO is a reliable source on that topic.</p>
<p>When your hairdresser tells you that Railco's stock price will rise because it always rises when the price of potatoes goes down (which is currently happening), it is NOT material because its relevance is very dubious, and because your hairdresser is not a reliable source and probably an idiot.</p>
<hr />
<p>NON-PUBLIC : this one is easy, the information must be voluntarily restricted in diffusion. Note that the restriction must not necessarily be restricted inside the company in question : any other organization that is privy to confidential information that might consitute MNPI at that company extends the domain of confidentiality : that includes their accountants, auditors, lawyers, but also government regulators etc...</p>
<p>When the CEO of Railco sends you a document that is confidential to the company and describes the enormous cost of a potential lawsuit, it is non-public.</p>
<p>When the CEO of Railco publishes the same document as part of a transparency campaign and you are the first to see it and sell your stock, it is NOT non-public.</p>
<p>When your buddy at Dewey, Chittem &amp; Howe (attorneys at law) tells you about that Railco document he saw because they are his clients, it is  non-public even if it does not come directly from Railco.</p>
<p>When the CEO of Railco accidentally reveals some very damaging information during a public hearing where you are present and you immediately sell your stock, it is NOT non-public because even thought the information was supposed to be confidential, it was disclosed as part of a public speech. If you hear him say the exact same thing to his colleague on the bus it IS NON-PUBLIC! Context is important!!</p>
<hr />
<p>INFORMATION : This aspect is the most difficult to ascertain. The Information must be, well, information. It has to pretend to convey a fact or a reality; it cannot be a &quot;feeling&quot; or an &quot;intuition&quot;. Warning though : the fact that it is not information but something else must be done in good faith and not as a concealment measure. Furthermore, anything that pretends to not be an information but is coming from an individual who is very likely to hold that information would never fly as &quot;oh that was just an intuition&quot; in court.</p>
<p>When the CEO of Railco tells you that he is sure he will blow the competition out of the sky, it is information.</p>
<p>When the CEO of Railco tells you that he has the intuition that their competition isnt going to fare very well <em>wink wink</em>, it is STILL information</p>
<p>When the CEO of Railco tells you that he has a feeling that the next year isnt going to be a very good year for the rail sector, it MIGHT NOT be Information, based on the data that he has available at his disposal.</p>
<p>When your buddy at Dewey, Chittem &amp; Howe (attorneys at law)  says he's got a bad feeling about this while making a Harrison Ford impression before going into the court room on behalf of Railco, it is PROBABLY information.</p>
<p>when your Hairdresser who loves potatoe stock says he feels the potato sector is doomed, it is not information, and it's probably not material anyway.</p>
<hr />
<p>From the moment you get MNPI in your possession or knowledge, you CANNOT act on it. It does not matter who or where you got it, if it qualifies as MNPI it puts you in legal jeopardy.</p>
<p>Hope that gives you some clues.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's craft a scenario.</p>
<p>I am the CEO of KinCo, of which you own stock. One day, I decide to kill myself, and decide to do it by jumping in front of the subway.</p>
<p>But because I want to convince myself to do it, I talk to you, a random person on the street to me, about the business and why I want to do it.</p>
<p>You, being a dutiful citizen, talk me out of killing myself, and I go home.</p>
<p>You then sell all your stock in KinCo, owing to your knowledge that her CEO, me, is suicidal.</p>
<p>I then complete my task the next day and the share price plummets.</p>
<p>That is insider trading.</p>
<p>The key pieces needed are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>An actionable position - do you have access to buy and sell stocks? This can include the ability to short sell or buy options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Important Knowledge - Do you know something about the company or it's business that would directly impact the price of the stock?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clairvoyance - Did that thing occur?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Action - Did you act upon your knowledge before the consequences of the action occurred?</p>
</li>
<li>Underhandedness - Do others know about it before you sold?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a TON of bad info here.  </p>
<p>This is super counter intuitive, but here is the correct answer   <strong><em>no, that would not be insider trading b/c the 'preexisting relationship' and 'personal benefit' tests have not been met.</em></strong>  I'm sure you might get investigated, but I seriously doubt charges would be brought if the person that approached is a true stranger.  This is consistent with both the recent <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/criminaljustice/2017/wccn2017_Patel.authcheckdam.pdf" target="_blank">Newman and Salaman rulings</a>.</p>
<p>The ELI5 is this: under the law, the person who gives you the information must 1) have a relationship with you (eg you have to have a reasonable suspicion that the info you get is 'real'), and 2) the person who gives you the info has to get some sort of benefit from doing it (this is the personal benefit test).</p>
<p>In your example, where a random person comes up to you and says, &quot;sell all of your TSLA! The whole company is a gigantic accounting fraud!&quot; and then runs off into the darkness, neither 1 nor 2 have been achieved.</p>
<p>The guy that writes the best about all this is Matt Levine at Bloomberg View.  And FWIW, I'm a former securities lawyer who moved into hedge funds - I follow this topic very closely. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically/legally, it's probably not insider trading, although colloquiually most people would assume it is. While we often shorthand insider trading as anything that's &quot;cheating&quot;, strictly speaking it's illegal because you're using someone else's info that you're obligated not to (ie, an employee insider trading is &quot;stealing&quot; from their employer), or you got a &quot;personal benefit&quot;.</p>
<p>However, a jury might convict you anyway, so there is still risk. The line is kind of fuzzy since it's kind of a terrible kludge. (Also, other countries have a much more common sense definition- the US is the outlier.)</p>
<p>A wonderful (and funny) read on these sorts of scenarios is Matt Levine's articles on insider trading. Here's just a few:</p>
