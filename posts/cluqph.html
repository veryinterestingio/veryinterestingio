		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Grass produces seed heads, you've probably seen those before. The seeds from those seed heads are harvested, dried and sold. If you put them into soil and water them, they sprout and grow into new grass. People who don't want those on their lawn make sure the conditions for the grass stays constant, it receives enough water and is mowed regularly (so seed heads can't develop).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work at a grass seed farm in high school and college during the summers (the research branch, so I literally measured grass for hours as part of my job). A fully grown grass plant looks basically like wheat: a longer stalk with a seed head on top. The nice blades of grass that make up your lawn? Those are the leaves that grow out of the stalk because, as long as you mow your grass regularly, you'll keep the stalk short and no seed head will develop.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Grasses are members of the Poaceae family. They are monocots. They are a flowering plant like any other flowering plant. They make seeds the same way other flowering plants do. They have male and female parts and are wind pollinated. As monocots, they have seeds that when they sprout will have single leaf initially.  The leaves are characterized by having long parallel veins the length of the leaves. </p>
<p>They otherwise reproduce like most other flowering plants. The flowers are very small and on a slender spike. Think of the typical wheat/grain stalk that you see. A long slender stem that rises above the plant itself and has the flowers and then the seed structures. </p>
<p>In a well managed lawn you generally will not see seed structures as the lawn is mowed regularly and that removes the flower spike before it can fully develop. Or becasue they are so small and not brightly colored. </p>
<p>Link to a site with a number of pics of grass seed heads.  <a href="http://www.walterreeves.com/lawn-care/turfgrasses-identifying/" target="_blank">http://www.walterreeves.com/lawn-care/turfgrasses-identifying/</a></p>
<p>Crabgrass is one of the crappy ones. It has VERY small seeds and the flower stalks can lay down flattish with the grass and may not get cut with a mower. They also make vast quantities of seed from each plant. Pic shows the flowers sticking off to the side.</p>
<p><a href="https://omahaorganicslawncare.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Crabgrass.jpg" target="_blank">https://omahaorganicslawncare.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Crabgrass.jpg</a></p>
<p>Any grain field will have all the parts of the plant since they do not get mowed because we want the grain head. So wheat, rye, barley, rice, millet, sorghum, oats, and even corn are poaceae plants.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
