		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They make their nuclear fuel “just-in-time” from widely available thorium, which itself is not useful for nuclear weapons or appealing for use in dirty bombs.</p>
<p>Thorium reactors essentially “burn” through a potential fuel bed like a flame along a strip of paper.  The leading edge turns “fertile” thorium into “fissile” uranium.  This uranium is almost immediately consumed by a nuclear reaction, advancing the edge of the reaction wave in the thorium and giving off heat.</p>
<p>Thorium is cheap, abundant and relatively safe to mine and transport.  If a bad actor tried to break into a thorium reactor, there is very little uranium or plutonium to divert or steal.  The reactor is mostly thorium, a small amount of uranium (of a type that is hard to weaponize), a vanishingly small amount of plutonium (also of a type that is hard to weaponize) and spent fuel products.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some decent explanations here, but much of what you hear in articles about Thorium reactors is either false or kind of mischaracterized. Here's a good resource written by some nuclear engineers that lays out some of those misconceptions and the advantages of Thorium reactors compared to uranium reactors.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most important feature of thorium reactors is that they do not operate at high pressures.
Current reactors operate at extremely high pressures and are built in containment vessels to keep that safe. Any problem or flaw risks breaking that containment vessel, which can cause explosive decompression, essentially ripping the pressure vessel open and spraying nuclear fuel into the air.</p>
<p>Thorium reactors do not need high pressures and can operate sealed, but not under pressure. Any flaw in the casing would cause it to 'leak' like a toilet overflowing, but not 'explode'.</p>
<p>They are also shown to be able to scale down. This means that they can be made much smaller and self-contained to the point that they could become modular devices.
Small self-contained units that could be dropped off to power arctic bases or etc. Run for 10-20 years, and be reconditioned or replaced.</p>
<p>Certain designs are also thought to be able to consume existing nuclear waste as fuel.
The idea is that large thorium reactors could be built next to existing plants or storage facilities and burn the stockpiled waste removing the problem of storage for 10 000 years.</p>
<p>Probably the best aspect of thorium reactors is their narrow band of sustainable reaction.
It was tested at Oak Ridge Labs that thorium reactors don't really 'melt down'. If they get too hot, the reaction moves out of the operating range and actually slows down, which cools it off, and lowers the temperature back into the correct range by itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert, but basically a thorium reactor would produce power with far fewer radioactive byproducts in the spent fuel.  Those products are much shorter lived too.  Current reactors produce waste that has half lives in the tens of thousands of years.  Thorium reactors would produce waste that has half lives in the tens or hundreds of years. The byproducts in the Thorium reactor waste also cannot be used in nuclear weapons.</p>
