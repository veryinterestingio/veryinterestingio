		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Define &quot;freshly baked&quot; and &quot;handmade&quot;</p>
<p>Its pretty hard right? What does freshly baked mean? 1 hour? 1 minute? 1 day? 5 days?</p>
<p>What does handmade mean? Does it mean I can use zero tools or machines? Can I use some tools? Some machines? Does it mean at some point someone was involved in the process and it wasn't just 100% automated? What is it?</p>
<p>It's pretty hard to define those topics, and that difficulty in definition is the key out here for companies.  These are not strict terms as you can see above, so they are up to interpretation.</p>
<p>Also, just to note, a lot of stuff in food chains is FAR more &quot;fresh&quot; than you'd initially think, they have extremely good logistics chains to get them fresh items and they turn over their inventory quickly so need to replenish it with new fresh items. Even onsite or offsite baked goods even as an example here are often quite fresh, as the logistics of fresh bread and such are an entire industry in itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most of those cases there is no legal standard for what that term means. In order for the law to enforce the standard, it has to define one first. For instance, nowadays there actually is a standard for What organic means in the United States. So a company can get in trouble for labeling its products organic if they do not meet that standard. But there is no standard for what defines fresh-baked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Theres a bit of gray area when it comes to those phrases. Taking a hunk of frozen dough, thawing and baking it lets places like Subway say that their bread is freshly baked. Pizza Hut gets their pan pizza dough in pre-mixed paper bags, a &quot;just add water&quot; pizza formula and makes big batches of it. Since both things are being prepared on-site by employees on the day they are intended for use they meet the minimum bar to be called fresh or handmade.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can you demonstrate otherwise?</p>
<p>Freshly baked implies baking within a short period of time, but how short? A day would be the absolute limit, but within a couple hours would be reasonable.</p>
<p>Handmade usually refers to the final production of the item from its ingredients. Using machine-made pastry would generally be accepted in a commercial environment. Again, limits need to be set or you'll be advocating for hand-milled flour and everything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
