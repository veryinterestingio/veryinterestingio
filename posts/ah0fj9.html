		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For example, in cultures where it's commonplace for women to be topless, are breasts typically considered arousing?</p>
<p>There surely still are (and at least there <em>have been</em>) small tribes where clothing is not worn at all. Is sexuality in these groups affected by these standards? A relation could be made between western nudist communities.</p>
<p>Are there (native or non-western) cultures that commonly fetishize body parts other than the western standard of vagina, penis, butt and breasts? If so, is clothing in any way related to this phenomenom?</p>
<p><strong>MOST IMPORTANTLY:</strong></p>
<p>If I was to do research on this topic myself, is there even any terminology for &quot;sexuality of a culture relating to clothes&quot;?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance of any good answers.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of studies on how and why we sexualize bodies, though I haven't found any that address your specific question. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29877123/" target="_blank">This paper</a> hits at your question, though in a more general sense. There's actually a difference in how sexualized bodies are processed visually. What we learn to sexualize is highly culture dependent, though that's self-evident and how different cultures teach this sexualization is very different and many, many papers exist that approach that area from different directions. </p>
<p>EDIT: It's worth noting that what <em>causes</em> different cultures to sexualize what they do is a complex and nuanced question under active study. A search for &quot;sexualize&quot; or &quot;sexualization&quot; on Pubmed or Google Scholar will give you hundreds of results on different facets of sexualization in a number of different cultures. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>“In an interesting account, Mr. Wang recalls the moment where his wife first unbound her feet in front of him. He describes this moment as a “beautiful sight” he continues to say that he had no words to explain his attraction to her feet.</p>
<p>We would expect that a non-Chinese man would have found the sight of bound feet despicable. For this reason, Gu likens bound feet/culture to the “delight of eating fried fermented bean curd and rotten eggs, native delicacies that no foreigner would touch.””</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Japan when geishas we’re still a thing, geishas were known for wearing very specific hairstyles and kimonos. The split peach hairstyle, which was the typical hairstyle you see on geishas was a large styling of hair into buns on the head that stayed in place because they would comb wax through the hair. In the back, a piece of red fabric was placed under the main large bun, and then the hair was “split” or separated down the middle to reveal a bit of the red fabric right on the center of the back of the head. It was meant to be arousing and suggestive. Also, geishas wore the collars of their kimonos all the was up to their necks in the front, so that in the back the collar could drape down exposing the back of the neck and some of the spine. This was like how we would view mini skirts today, they thought the neck was elegant and beautiful. Also the white makeup they used on their faces and necks would be carefully put on so it looked like a mask rather than covering the entire face so you can remember it’s a real woman, and they left part of the back of the neck without the white makeup to expose the skin just a little more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OP, apologies if you’ve already done so, but have you tried posting this in r/AskAnthropology ? It’s an interesting question! I can also imagine finding some fascinating answers in r/AskHistory . Just be sure to frame the question historically if you pursue that route, e.g. “what did the men and women of the early Ottoman Empire find sexually arousing or attractive?” </p>
<p>Or something like, “The Silk Road was a conduit for trade, but also ideas and culture. Were ideas about sexuality transmitted throughout this central network? If so, what sort of ideas?”</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I haven’t really seen anyone discuss this so I’ll toss it in here. </p>
<p>In biological anthropology we’re taught about sexual dimorphism and secondary sexual traits in different species. Sexual dimorphism is where the two sexes display different characteristics e.g. the Lion has a mane and the Lioness doesn’t or Peacocks have big flashy feathers while Peahens don’t. It gets more complicated with size, weight, color, and something called secondary sexual characteristics. </p>
<p>Secondary sex characteristics are things that aren’t directly related to reproduction or the act of sex but are linked to puberty and attractiveness as part of competition. In humans these are, for women: wider hips and higher levels of body fat (not obesity but a little extra padding in the thigh, hips, and bum), pubic hair, development of breasts and a few weird things like elbow extension angles and upper arm length. In men; growth of pubic/body/facial hair, larger size of vocal cords/deeper voice, broader features, more muscle, and generally bigger features. </p>
<p>Generally, you’re attracted to the secondary sexual characteristics that differ due to sexual dimorphism. These come with the notion that certain characteristics are more advantageous than others, i.e early humans were more attracted to a woman with wider hips, a larger bum, and larger breasts because of the benefits those features had during the reproductive cycle. Same with men, where larger and more physically fit men would be perceived as being able to provide better protection or stronger offspring. </p>
<p>You can see it a lot in early figurines and statues where ‘idols’ or ‘goddesses’ were generally thicker with very large hips. The Greek Mother Goddess figurines are a good example of this. </p>
<p>These traits are usually subconscious and inherent to your sex (obviously there are exceptions) until you bring culture into the mix. As most of the other posts have pointed out there are things that are sexualized more or less depending on the culture. I would argue that most of these features still fall within the secondary sexual characteristics of a human, small feet, belly buttons, neck lines, legs or more characteristics that differ between male and female. </p>
<p>This is even more apparent for the more prominent secondary sexual characteristics like breast size, labia, penis size and more, I think they’ll always be sexualized across humanity but to varying levels. There will always be an attraction to these types of traits but the approach to those attractions can differ wildly. Someone above mentioned how women think men with big arms and muscly chests are attractive but not sexualized. Same way that, as someone mentioned above, in Victorian times ankles were sexualized. They’re all secondary sexual characteristics. </p>
<p>TL;DR</p>
<p>You’ll always find certain sexual characteristics attractive regardless of what culture you’re in and each culture will treat its sexualization differently and to varying degrees. </p>
<p>PS:</p>
<p>This is purely from a bio-anth point of view and I’m in no way and expert however, I did study it in undergrad and it is part of my discipline. </p>
<p>I also realize that it doesn’t address some more current issues with gender, sexuality, and things like that so please don’t think I’m biased against those things. I also say always a lot but there obviously exceptions to the rule and a lot of variation with the impact of culture. </p>
<p>Last thing, there’s always a lot of debate between and amongst anthropologists, medical professionals, sociologists, and psychologists. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
