		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, light is a photon, and it gets emitted by something (like a star) and it travels at ~300,000 km/sec in a vacuum. I can understand this. Gravity on the other hand, as I understand it, isn't something that's emitted like some kind of tractor beam, it's a deformation in the fabric of the universe caused by a massive object. So, what I'm wondering is, is there a limit to the range at which this deformation has an effect. Does a big thing like a black hole not only have stronger gravity in general but also have the effects of it's gravity be felt further out than a small thing like my cat? Or does every massive object in the universe have some gravitational influence on every other object, if very neglegable, even if it's a great distance away? And if so, does that gravity move at some kind of speed, and how would it change if say two black holes merged into a bigger one? Additional mass isn't being created in such an event, but is &quot;new gravity&quot; being generated somehow that would then spread out from the merged object?</p>
<p>I realize that it's entirely possible that my concept of gravity is way off so please correct me if that's the case. This is something that's always interested me but I could never wrap my head around.</p>
<p>Edit:  I did not expect this question to blow up like this, this is amazing.  I've already learned more from reading some of these comments than I did in my senior year physics class.  I'd like to reply with a thank you to everyone's comments but that would take a lot of time, so let me just say &quot;thank you&quot; to all for sharing your knowledge here.  I'll probably be reading this thread for days.  Also special &quot;thank you&quot; to the individuals who sent silver and gold my way, I've never had that happen on Reddit before.</p></div></div>

<p>Every piece of matter in the universe is attracted to every other piece of matter in the universe. And when wild things happen, like neutron stars merging, the hiccup in gravity you feel from them spiraling into each other at half the speed of light arrives in almost lockstep with the light from the explosion from the matter they fling off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you’re wondering why would gravity waves just so happen to have the same speed as light, even though they would not seem to have a direct relationship, it’s because the speed of light is not actually specifically about light; it’s about <em>causality.</em>  Calculations show that if any kind of information-bearing phenomenon whatsoever were to travel faster than this, causality would be violated.  Which would mean that consequences could precede their own causes — i.e. time travel.  </p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/msVuCEs8Ydo" target="_blank">This YouTube video</a> has an excellent explanation of this. </p>
<p>Light is what we normally refer to for this speed simply because it’s readily accessible/understandable, and is relatively easy to measure.  But in general, any wave in any massless field <em>must</em> propagate at the speed of light (causality); only phenomena that are associated with mass are ever able to travel slower than that.  </p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/gSKzgpt4HBU" target="_blank">This video</a>  from the same channel explains this part really well.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modern consensus is gravity moves at the speed of light. There is no distance limit except for distances so great that the accumulated expansion of space is moving things apart faster than light; but gravity gets weaker with distance, so for stuff very far away the effect is negligible.</p>
<p>When blackholes merge, the resulting gravity matches the sum of the two blackhole gravities almost exactly, but there is some loss of mass in the form of the gravitational waves emitted during the downspiral. There isn't a sudden change in the deformation, the gravity of multiple objects overlap, the distortions add up; so as blackholes get closer and closer, the overall deformation gradually transitions towards matching the end result.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
