		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A wind turbine doesn't really care how fast it is spinning as far as the power output is concerned. For example if you take a small electric motor, it will probably require 1% of a horsepower to spin at several thousand revolutions per minutes (rpm). A container ship engine rotates only at a few hundred rpm but outputs tens of thousands of horsepower. The power output is only proportional to the rotation speed for a given design.</p>
<p>A longer blade means that you can harvest more wind energy. The power is basically dependent on the area of the disk covered by the path of the blades. So making a blade twice as long increase the energy output roughly by 4. </p>
<p>Moreover wind turbine blades are essentially wings. And wings are the most efficient (the least drag) when they are as long as possible. At the tip of the blade there are all sorts of turbulences that reduces blade efficiency. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other people have covered the idea that the longer the blades, the larger the crosssectional area, the more wind you can capture, but I want to go into some detail on the idea of how fast the blades should spin. </p>
<p>So to understand this, first off it is important to note that there is a maximum possible wind turbine efficiency of 59%. This is called the Betz limit. I can try to summarize the math if people are curious, but the simplest explanation is just to think of an air molecule passing through the turbine, if all the speed was removed from the particle, it would just sit on other side and get in the way of the incoming air. So the air leaving the turbine needs to still have some velocity, the maximum efficiency occurs when the air leaving has 1/3 the velocity of the air entering, which will give an efficiency of 16/27 or ~59%. </p>
<p>Now how close a turbine can get to the Betz limit involves some complicated aerodynamics, but it depends on the turbine design, and the tip speed ratio (how fast the tip spins retaliative to the upwind speed) If you spin too slow, wind slips between the blades unused, but if you spin too fast, the turbulence created reduces your energy. The most efficient turbine design we have found is the three blade turbine, which can reach up to ~80% of the Betz limit at its optimal tip speed ratio of ~ 7x. <a href="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/lecture1-windenergycoursemughal-141002064111-phpapp02/95/wind-energy-course-mughal-80-638.jpg?cb=1412232337" target="_blank">Here is a chart of the rotor efficiency of different turbine designs as a function of tip speed ratio</a></p>
<p>I actually teach a course on renewable energy engineering, so I really enjoy these questions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>More speed doesn't necessarily imply more electricity. More force from bigger blades can turn a bigger gear and so drive a more powerful generator. More, smaller wind turbines would need more mounting masts and the other infrastructure that goes with them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Torque = Force * radius</p>
<p>Force = Net Pressure delta * Net Area</p>
<p>It's just a materials optimization problem.  The blades are as long as they can structurally take the stress based on the rotating radius and rpm.  If we had even stronger materials, the blades would be even taller.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wow, lots of partially correct and outright wrong answers in here. The correct answer is that as the blades get larger, you actually need to spin slower. The key is the tip speed ratio (TSR, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tip-speed_ratio" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tip-speed_ratio</a>) which is the ratio of the tip speed to the incoming wind speed. There's a sweet spot for efficiency around 6-8 TSR (see the plots in the wiki). Obviously you'll have constraints due to the rest of the turbine components having limitations, but the energy extraction starts with the blades so keeping those efficient is important. So spinning faster is true for smaller turbines, but total power available is a function of swept area so a larger, slower spinning turbine will produce more energy</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
