		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Any map that shows land where Antarctica really is but before it's discovery is not actually depicting Antarctica but instead a then hypothetical continent called Terra Australis. It's not based on any observations but purely speculative. Various geographers and cartographers just assumed that all the landmass in the northern hemisphere should be balanced out by equal landmass in the southern hemisphere, but they knew places it <em>couldn't</em> be from previous exploration, so they put in the place they hadn't been to yet. They just happen to be correct that there was a continent there, but the maps are all pure guesses, so the size and shape varies because it's made up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember someone pointing out that sailors going way back claimed to be able to tell the difference between an iceberg formed at sea and an iceberg that forms near shore, I suppose because the ones that form on land carry gravel and other non-floating impurities.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So sailors puttering around in the Southern Ocean would have seen dirty ice islands and concluded that there was land somewhere, even if they couldn't see it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, there is the theory of Terra Australis, but at the same time  </p>
<p>many old maps are copied from older maps that are copied from older maps  </p>
<p>and some of those maps are very accurate in their mapping parts of the antarctic coast  </p>
<p>The most famous, the piri reis map, has notations on it by piri reis that say he made his map from copying many older maps</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
