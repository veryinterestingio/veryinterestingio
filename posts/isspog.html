		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The legal minimum is liability insurance.  Since it's very easy to cause hundreds of thousands of dollars of harm to someone else, states usually require you have some way of paying any damages in such a situation. </p>
<p>The preferred way is an insurance plan: you pay an insurer a monthly/annual amount and they agree to cover most of any claims you are responsible for paying in the event of an accident you cause.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Insurance is what is called a shared risk pool.  Everybody pays a monthly fee to mitigate the financial risk of having an accident.  Everybody pools their money and repairs are paid out of that pool.  Safer drivers in this situation are basically subsidizing the reoair costs of less skilled drivers.  If you are a higher risk of causing an accident then you pay a higher premium every month because you are more likely to decrease the size of the pool by making a claim.</p>
<p>It is mandatory for 2 reasons.  </p>
<p>1.) The bigger the pool the smaller the risk, which drives rates down.</p>
<p>2.) Unless you are particularly wealthy there is no reasonable way to expect you to be able to cover your liability in an accident, so the state requires you to carry enough liability insurance to compensate the other party for losses incurred by the damage you caused.</p>
<p>Most states will waive the insurance requirement if you can demonstrate an ability to cover your liability on your own without insurance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A bunch of number nerds called “actuaries” run a lot of very complex excel spreadsheets and determine the amount of money auto related crashes, thefts and other losses will be in a given area.  They take this educated guess and divide that by the average number of drivers in the given area.  They add little things like “desired profit margin” and “agents commissions” and “advertising budget” to get an average premium.  Then these number nerds figure out things that are likely to lead to having a crash or loss and adjust this average premium to an individual policy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great, my wife is an underwriter and since I hear her talk (TLVs etc) I can answer, crap people already have. </p>
<p>There was a good skit where Chris Rock talks about insurance. &quot;In case shit happens&quot;, and he isn't far off. </p>
<p>STOP, don't think about medical insurance, it is a perversion of what insurance is supposed to be. So you have an expensive product, a car, or an old sailing ship (from where the word 'underwriter' actually comes from) full of stuff. You have enough money to buy this thing and MAYBE you have enough money to replace it. What you can't possibly have enough money for is if you crash your car into another car and then crash into a building and someone needs six months of intensive care. </p>
<p>So, enter insurance. For a monthly fee I agree to operate my vehicle in a safe manner in accordance with the insurance stipulations. This gets super important if that vehicle is really expensive or if you are dealing with cat insurance on commercial buildings. Assuming you are fitting the criteria, and the event wasn't an 'act of god' (yeah, look it up), that money you pay promises that should an event happen, the firm you insured with will take care of the accident or incident. </p>
<p>So think about this, if you are loading up a sailing ship in 1686 and you went in with a bunch of your buddies to create a stock-company to fund this expedition, you may find that you are still uncomfortable with risk. So the newly formed Lloyd's of London may 'back' you with many more investors, their sign off is 'underwritten' by them. In other words, they looked at the entire idea of your expedition and found the captain was good to go, the ship is in good repair, the cargo is whatever. So your risk starts looking a lot better, if you total loss that thing you and your buddies will take a hit, but insurance will pay out. Lloyd's makes money by backing many expeditions, most which will not fail. It is like a pyramid scheme, but legal, provided you have enough policy holders who are paying regularly and not sinking their ships, you are making money and risk is controlled. This is why insurance likes to ask probing questions and send inspectors of their own. Once you seek insurance it is your risk AND their risk, and if they have been doing it a long time (as in car insurance) with a lot of customers, the insurance is WAY more qualified to understand risk than you are. So you are paying to reduce your risk and to generally have your back. </p>
<p>Before autos and auto insurance, you might have had crop insurance but the average person had nothing nearly valuable enough to actually insure. And, if you did, you often were required to store it at a bank or something. A car is the most valuable thing other than a home most people will have, so you pay insurance on it in a manner not unlike the original Lloyds way back in the 17th century.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
