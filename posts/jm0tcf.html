I'm slightly interested in purchasing my own (cheap) microscope and just having a field day in my backyard, if that'd be viable.</p>
<p>I've been looking at some Wikipedia pages and there's tonnes of pages that list tiny (0.1/0.2mm) insects and other critters whilst stating that they're commonly found in regular top soil everywhere. Some sources that I've found online list incredible numbers of arthropods, insects, nematodes, etc., with numbers up to millions per square feet.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi there! So, this is really a macro/microbial ecology question. And there are no simple answers as to “which and how many” organisms you’ll find. This is because the living and organic composition of your soil is so, so dependent on location, history (or hysteresis as we like to call it), and culture (I.e., human intervention in the soil). </p>
<p>It is not a very satisfying answer, but I can provide some general rules of thumb for what you might find at that level of magnification:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>lots of fungal hyphae, some larger, multicellular (resistant) spores (such as <em>Fusarium</em>), and tons of bacterial films/mats/agglomerates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nematodes, trematodes, other -todes, and lots and lots and lots of itty bitty worms: thread, flat, segmented, carnivorous, herbivorous, microbiophores (pretty sure I made that one up but I like it), etc. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if it’s well tended, aerated soil with lots of organic matter and a balanced pH for your area, you are likely to find significantly more visible critters than otherwise</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you’ll never see anywhere close to “everything,” or even a bit, of what is there: you’ll be missing (at 100x mirror or even underlit) most single-cell organisms, hyperparasites, viruses, sessile organisms that look like detritus, and etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>much of what you see (especially the fungi, alga, and bacterial microfilms/mats) will be made by organisms that are undescribed in the scientific literature (see ^1 below)</p>
</li>
<li>the greatest diversity will be in the top 4-20cm  of soil, where aeration and compaction should be ideal and organic matter is higher. </li>
</ul>
<p>Soil, plant, and microbial scientists have been examining soils since microscopes (and hand lenses) were invented. Most productive exploration done these days is using environmental DNA studies in soil and aquatic environments. </p>
<p>————————————</p>
<p>^1 One of my first PhD projects involved isolating fungi living inside the stems of grasses. From a very small number of individuals of one species of invasive annual grass, we isolated more than 1,000 distinct colonies of culturable-filamentous fungi and yeasts. We could identify less than 10% to genus, about 10 actual colonies to species (only because they are known plant pathogens), and when we ran PCR on the whole shebang we got up to about 15% identification to family/genus for culturalable fungi. That was probably about 75% of the actual fungi (many aren’t able to be cultured or isolated in a lab), none of the bacteria, etc. </p>
<p>There were also three species of nematode and some other worms. Inside the stem of a small grass a couple of mm in diameter. </p>
<p>Tl;dr: The soil In your garden is the final (biological) frontier. We don’t know much about what is in it, but I’d be willing to bet there is a lot going on. And as a research scientist in that field, I wouldn’t even be able to identify most of what you’ll see under a microscope without a lot of work, a bunch of manuals, a budget for PCR and running some phylogenetic models, and a fully outfitted microbiology laboratory. But you should definitely look, and be amazed!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With 40-100x magnification you can see a lot more than you'd think. Speaking from my college Soil Science lab experience in USA, a small sample of soil diluted in some water and placed on a microscope slide can reveal lots of different species. Rotifers, nematodes, and various arthropods should be visible. In a small bit of water you can see them move more easily. You'll likely find lots of plant and fungi material. Also at 100x magnification you should start to see bacteria appearing as small indistinguishable dots. Have fun!</p>
<ul>
<li>The most fun in my opinion was to see how they move and behave, i've watched micros cannibalize each other and others come on contact and quickly avoid each other.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I took an ecology course in college. Day 3 or 4 of the semester, everybody brought in a handful of soil from our homes and threw it into a large Rubbermaid filled with shredded newspaper. Over the course of the semester, we were able to add in any biodegradable organic material (a lot of the food stuffs had to be frozen overnight first, to combat flies). By the end of the semester, the bin was full of deep rich black soil. We each took a small amount and analyzed it under magnification and logged the number of critters we could see. So many. It was a lower level class, so it was a quantitative analysis as opposed to a qualitative, but such a cool experiment. It’s been 20-something years, but I’ll never forget it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
