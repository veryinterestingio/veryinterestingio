		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To put it as simply as possible, this is the process that happens:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a chip that is always listening in the echo. It doesn't record, doesn't transmit to Amazon.</li>
<li>When this chip hears the wake word (Alexa, Amazon, Echo or Computer, whatever you have set) it activates a buffer, recording a bit (less than a few seconds)</li>
<li>This is sent up to Amazon where their better processing (their servers are obviously more powerful than an echo) verifies the wake word was said</li>
<li>If the wake word wasn't said, the buffer is purged. If not, the buffer gets analyzed along with any continued speech for commands</li>
</ol>
<p>The buffer is used so it is smooth, otherwise, you'd have to say &quot;Alexa&quot; wait for it to verify, with a pause, then state your command. The couple second buffer allows smoother &quot;Alexa, turn on the lights&quot; type commands</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a special circuit which is listening to everything waiting on &quot;Alexa&quot;. When it hears that word it will wake up recording and language processing for the rest of the speaking, but until then it is just that single chip which can only recognize &quot;Alexa&quot; and records nothing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I like to think of it like a dinner party - you are constantly able to hear what everyone else is saying at the table, but you don’t pay attention and actually listen until you hear your own name. </p>
<p>Alexa works similarly, ‘hearing’ what you say (through a looping recording process), but not really listening until you say the wake word. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 2 different listening programs. </p>
<p>One is very simple, only understands a few words (the &quot;wake up&quot; command) and is permanently running. It listens for a few seconds, if it doesn't hear the key words, it deletes whatever it recorded and starts again. Over and over. </p>
<p>Once the first process detects the wake up command (Okay Google, or Alexa, or whatever) it launches the second process. </p>
<p>The second process connects to its parent server cluster (Google, Amazon, etc) through the Internet, and is ready to accept your command. </p>
<p>Of note, the little gizmo in your home isn't actually powerful enough to translate your speech to text and search. All it does it record the sounds and send it back to a big server cluster somewhere for the heavy lifting. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's always listening <em>locally</em>  without recording or sending <del>days</del> data over the internet to the cloud servers until it hears the wake word.
