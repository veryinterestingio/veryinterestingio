		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I understand that ice has a surface layer that's much more mobile (though not really liquid water) which makes it very slippery. This, so I am told, is due to it being a polar covalent molecular solid. Fair enough.</p>
<p>What I don't understand then is why Diamond is even more slippery, when it is a monatomic non-molecular, non-covalent crystalline solid.</p>
<p>It can't be simply smoothness. Optical quality glass isn't remotely slippery, yet rough, sharp, opaque ice created from freezing rain is still slippery even against other ice. Why is rough ice slippery, diamond slippery, but glass not?</p>
<p>And how about dry ice? It's not nearly as slippery as water ice as long as the thing touching it is also cold.</p>
<p>What about metals? Aluminium (with the oxide layer) isn't slippery. Nor is gold, steel, copper, Zinc, Lead, Alkali metals, etc.</p>
<p>So what makes ice and diamond slippery and other smooth, solid surfaces not? Is there some kind of rule for what materials will be slippery?</p></div></div>

It seems like the common theme is some layer of free moving molecules on the surface of the substance, but it's still an area of active research. Given the conclusion in the article, I wonder if diamonds would have more friction in a vacuum? It's interesting that something so commonplace still has no definitive explanation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The factors that go into the friction between 2 objects are crazy complicatred and not even nearly understood. There is not some overall governing rule about which are slippy and which are not. At the most basic level there are adhesive forces which act between object that are touching. These are the same forces that act within solids to keep the molecules from flying apart, the strength of these depends on the materails.</p>
<p>But this is not even nearly the whole story becuase almost no surfaes in the real world are just the end of the solid, you mention oxide layers on metals for instance. These are actually extremely 'slippery', without them the metals touch, and the surfaes cold weld together. This causes problems in space but also when bearings sieze.</p>
<p>Water ice is another good example: it is slippy to your fingers at the temperatures which we comonly encounter it. This is because it melts in the contact providing a lubricant, extremely cold ice will stick to your hand becuse it solidifies the outer layer of your skin.</p>
<p>But even this is not the end of the nightmare, so far we have just been talking about adhesion, the forces that directly attract solid objects to eachother (over tiny distances). But this is just one factor that leads to a macroscopic friction value. For instance sheet ice and sheet steel can give extremely low friction if they are on an ice skate, again this is because the contact is lubricated by water. But exactly the same materials in a crampon will keep an ice climber on a verticle wall. These are extreme examples, but the point is that the shape and hardnesses of the materials also matter a lot.</p>
<p>There are other forms of friciton too, but the real problem is that what we experiance as friction dosn't actually map onto a single physical phenomena very well. The overall systems are also extremely hard to study as changing anything in them typically has a lot of undesired side effects.</p>
<p>Experiments that people have done with diamonds are normally deigned to cut out all of the other forms of friction, and look only at adhesion. This means that there is no ploughing of one material through another etc. that would cause a lot of the friction in the real world. Like someone else has said diamonds are covalently bonded, imagine eachcarbon atom has 4 hands that want to shake hands with another. Recent molecular modelling of these contacts (<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.096101" target="_blank"><a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.096101" target="_blank">https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.096101</a></a>) has shown that the lonely hands at the edges attract water molecules from the air and keep them there, this forms a lubricating layer as the bonds between water molecules are weak (ish). If you push them together too hard or try the same thing in a vacuum the surfaces cold weld just like a metal.</p>
<p>Glasses are held together by van der waals forces, these forces are way more general than covalent bonds and will try to stick to anything close. This increases the friction, but also as glass is much softer than diamond it is hard to eliminate the other forms of friciton.</p>
<p>The take home here is that 'friciton' if it is a sensible concept at all, should only be thought of as a property of the whole system including the materials, geometry, bonding and lubrication. It is not a property of a single material or even a pair of materials.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Ionic compounds never make molecules (only networks); covalent compounds can make either molecules or networks.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’d challenge the premise of this question a bit. Are diamonds slippery in a way glass is not? I would not describe glass (especially wet glass) as “not remotely slippery.” Others have covered the myriad of reasons something might slip or stick but I’m not sure the examples given actually hold up (perhaps they do but have not seen any evidence to back it up).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I thought ice was slippery because placing an object on the ice increases the pressure on the ice, causing a thin layer of water to form under the object.
