		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because we don't slam our balls that hard during intercourse.  Also we are banging them into fleshy labia so its not like a brick wall. If it hurt we would stop and humans are fairly good at unconsciously understanding the limits of our body.</p>
<p>If someone sack taps me it's like flicking your ear.  It hurts and since the genitals are a sensitive area it hurts a lot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During arousal the scrotum tightens up.  Your balls aren't moving as much as during sex as you'd think.  This can cause separate issues actually.  The fabled &quot;blue balls&quot; is one, and so is a varicocele.  Merely getting aroused can become painful.</p>
<p>They also dangle, so they're already slowing down from their connection to your body when you bottom out, then coming to a stop a moment later.</p>
<p>It's a full hit too, the entire scrotum takes the impact instead of just one ball.  This makes it hurt less.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ol>
<li>The force is not as great slapping during intercourse compared to being hit or flicked.</li>
<li>The ability to feel pain is something that happens in the brain.</li>
<li>The brain can feel pain even without nerves (ghost pain) or when the brain thinks it should feel brain (one can feel pain in a fake hand you think is yours). The point here is that the brain controls the sensation of pain not the actual nerves.</li>
<li>During intercourse there is a different mode going on in the brain. A good example of this is that the room might feel cold but once the groove train gets going the temperature sensation fades.</li>
</ol>
<p>Essentially, the nervous system concentrates on making babies, during intercourse. When you are not making babies, the nervous system is more eager to react to potentially damaging sensations, like those of mechanical pressure or tissue tearing from the balls. And last, the actual force of balls slapp'n in the breeze is not directly comparable to a hit from a tennis ball or a punch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
