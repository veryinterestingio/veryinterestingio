		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The critical flicker frequency, as in what <del>higher</del> lower threshold frequency something must flicker for the eye to detect it, is not the same over the whole retina. The peripheral retina tends to be able to detect higher frequency flickering than the central parts of the retina because the outer parts of the retina has a higher proportion of the light sensitive rods (as opposed to color cones) than the central retina and that makes it better at detecting changes in light intensity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because rods in your peripheral vision require less light to activate, leading to higher response rate. This comes at the cost of lower resolution and lower color perception. But rapid change in brightness ? Yes</p>
<p>Incidentally, this means your peripheral vision is less able to observe persistence of vision effects. </p>
<p>It is probably a large component of motion sickness in vr (and this explains why vignetting offers relief to VR sick people)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with the distribution of the two types of light receptors on your retina</p>
<p>In the center of the retina, almost all of the light receptors are cones. Cones are used to differentiate between colors and respond well to bright light but aren't sensitive to low light. They also react slower to changes in light level. It's important to have good color differentiation in the center of your vision so you can determine which berries are ripe, or to see the fine details of whatever you are actively looking at</p>
<p>In your peripheral vision, almost all of the light receptors are rods. Rods are used to tell brightness, but they don't differentiate colors. This is why when it's extremely dark, there doesn't appear to be any colors. They also respond very quickly to rapid changes in brightness. It's important to respond rapidly to changes in the periphery to avoid something coming at you like a predator, which you might not be looking directly at.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have pointed out, there is a difference in the speed of response of your retinal cells in different areas of your retina.</p>
<p>But there's another effect, and that is that if your eyes are moving, the flickering image will be &quot;stamped out&quot; across different places on your retina. In other words, when your eye moves, a flicking light can make a &quot;trail&quot; that looks like many separate copies of the light, like a strobe, whereas a steady light will make a blurry streak. This is often the easiest way to tell whether a light is flickering— to quickly glance to left and right of it, and look for the repeated copies. <a href="https://kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/kajabi-storefronts-production/blogs/1049/images/Em4yqPyqS16vidH02KPe_Picture_1_phantom_array.jpg" target="_blank">This image</a> very roughly shows the visual difference.</p>
<p>This works because the motion of your eye basically converts a time pattern into a spatial pattern, and your eye has better spatial resolution than time resolution for this case. In fact, this principle is how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streak_camera" target="_blank">streak cameras</a> work, which are able to take images at nearly a trillion FPS!</p>
<p>You don't normally see this effect, though, because your eyes automatically &quot;lock&quot; on their subjects without you having to think about it (this is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade" target="_blank">saccadic motion</a>), preventing the subject from making a trail/blur on your retina. You will only see the pattern in the brief period when your eyes are quickly changing from one target to another, which your brain does a lot of work to hide from you! So it may take some practice/care to notice the effect, but it could contribute to the feeling that lights only flicker when you're not looking directly at them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of comments are covering how your eyes contribute to this, but I didn't see anyone mention the other half of the issue. <em>What</em> is flickering? LEDs aren't constantly emitting when connected to an AC power supply. They go in pulses in time with the power frequency (60 Hz in North America). This is low enough that most people will notice it in their periphery, and some will notice it when looking directly at it. Almost no one sees it at higher frequencies, which is why newer TVs try to get to 120 Hz. And you won't notice this with incandescent lights because the filament doesn't cool enough to stop emitting even at those lower frequencies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
