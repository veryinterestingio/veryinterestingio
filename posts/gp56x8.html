To allow photos that capture your entire face, you'll need a wide lens in this case. If you want a nice portrait, ask a friend who has a decent camera and a 125-300mm lens. This will also force the photographer to use a larger distance and your face will look more natural.</p>
<p>If you are a man and want to look handsome, squint your eyes while taking photo. Seriously, try it.</p>
<p>Edit: Technically it's the short distance that distorts your face. I associated it with a wide lens because it's needed to capture objects that are near and quite large. Thanks u/Andre_Lac.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In your mirror your image is flipped horizontally. That is how you most often see yourself and that is how you expect yourself to look.</p>
<p>Selfie cameras show your image not flipped, how everyone else sees you. Since all faces are somewhat asymmetrical, this looks subtly off to you and that feeling usually makes you not like it. But your selfie looks normal to everyone else.</p>
<p>Also selfie cameras tend to be pretty wide angle and held fairly close to the face which is not an attractive way to photograph someone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The mirror is flat, the lens is round. This creates distortion.</p>
<p>You look at the mirror and see an over 16K resolution. Your phone creates a possibly interpolated 4K version with pixellation, compression artifacts, banding, and other digital anomalies.</p>
<p>The light is steady when looking in the mirror. Selfies depend on steady hands.</p>
<p>The angle is dead on in the mirror. The selfie depends on the angle.</p>
<p>The mirror is distant enough for you to take everything in. The phone is arms length.</p>
<p>Mirrors allow your eyes to focus. Phones try to focus accurately but are not as good as your eyes.</p>
<p>Your eyes handle imagery (with help from your brain.) Your phone depends on lens, algorithms, settings and processing speeds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
