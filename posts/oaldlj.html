Did the base of their feet became so rugged they didn't felt it? Or they just learnt to handle it? What about those devilish spiky seeds that are almost everywhere?</p></div></div>

<p>Yes.  The more you walk barefoot, you develop SOME callouses and become less sensitive.  (I’m perms-barefooted where possible and my feet are more muscular and padded but not particularly calloused)</p>
<p>More importantly, you walk differently. </p>
<p>People wearing shoes are clumsy and heavy footed and walk by picking up their feet and falling forward with all of their weight step after step, directly on the heel. (Additionally, cushioned shoes INCREASE the amount of force you hit the ground with. They’ve done studies where people run on a treadmill with and without shoes and people wearing shoes hit the ground with twice as much force just to be able to feel the ground.  Think about having to shout to be heard by someone with ear plugs)</p>
<p>If you go barefooted, you learn to PLACE your feet before putting weight on them.  You put your foot down, and if there’s rock or pointy stuff underneath, you put more weight on your toes or your heels or wherever is suitable. </p>
<p>Do it for a few years and it takes no thought.  You take slightly shorter steps, place your feet on the ground and then ease weight onto it.  </p>
<p>Yes.  If you go barefooted and pretend you’re wearing heavy boots, you’re only one step away from stone bruises and other pain.</p>
<p>But otherwise, being barefooted increases your connection to the ground and lessens the impact of your footfall on the ground and your joints.  </p>
<p>As far as running, you still “place” your feet. Being barefoot, the speed at which your brain communicates with the bottom of your feet is infinitely faster and more detailed. You just run much lighter. You make more gentle contact on dangerous ground and retrieve the foot faster if you find sharp rocks or hostile ground.  Not every step is a full step where all of your weight lands.  Often times you have some half steps or hop steps where don’t commit your weight to the ground if the foot falls on a pointy rock.  </p>
<p>Think of it like trying to read Braille while wearing oven mitts.  There’s a world of information most people never make contact with by wearing shoes.    Most people’s feet are so horribly sensitive because the feet are supposed to be every bit as sensitive as hands but people swaddle them and stick them inside of marshmallows their whole life. </p>
<p>If you’re really interested in this stuff, look up a book called “Born to Run” by someone McDougal. </p>
<p>Edit: added references.
Edit: I think my biggest grievance with people saying “calluses” is that it’s a bad thought process.   People saying “calluses” insinuate that we naturally develop “shoes” if we don’t have shoes.  Like the fact that feet are soft and sensitive is a mistake. Evolution wouldn’t have left all those nerve endings down there if they were a mistake.   If we were supposed to have hooves, we’d have hooves.    The problem isn’t soft feet.  It’s clumsy modern  humans that never learned how to develop a relationship with the surface we live on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The more you subject your soft sensitive skin to friction, calluses form.  Also the more you deal with the pain of walking on rough surface your tolerance to the pain will increase.</p>
<p>Edit:  Humans started wearing shoes approximately 40,000 years ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With wear your feet eventually develop callouses which are thick layers of skin built up as a result of small injuries to the skin on the bottom of our feet. This makes them much harder and it makes walking on bad terrain easier.</p>
<p>Also, they may not necessarily be barefoot. Animal skins lashed to feet can provide protection if crude.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I grew up in Southern California and never wore shoes all summer.  All my friends were the same way.  We could stand on a manhole cover for a few minutes, we did stupid things like this to see who would jump off first.  </p>
<p>I rode 10 speed bikes with those sharp metal pedals too.  I remember one time we snuck into the skating rink and stepped on the ice bare footed to see who would jump off first.  </p>
<p>I guess what I’m trying to say here is, your feet toughen up.  My best friends older brother was working on his car bare footed once.  We took a magnifying glass and burned his heal.  He didn’t feel it but he smelled it and we got caught.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
