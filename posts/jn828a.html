		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short version: you get hungry when your body deems it necessary to supplement it with sources of bioenergy. If you don't, your body will compensate from its internal stores leading to a cessation of the signal or at least reduction to a level you can easily be distracted from.</p>
<p>The slightly longer version:the list of hormones involved is long. It includes satiety, appetite, hunger, and metabolic hormones (these functional identities often overlap for a given hormone). Examples include ghrelin, CCK, leptin, PYY, GLP-1, insulin, glucagon, ILP5, amylin, to name a few. Some hormones act acutely to dips in a given signal, some are latent, and the signal itself can be acute (like empty stomach or low blood glucose) or chronic (like high fat stores). There is also a hierarchy between these hormones, some act upstream and control others. And some have dominant effects, overpowering others even if they signal in opposite functional directions. When you're hungry, the balance shifted towards your body sensing low available energy, and some other hormones are secreted to release energy from your stores (gluconeogenesis from many stores of variable priority). However there's obviously a lag between stimulus and response, that window you can feel hunger. And the response won't fully compensate, and even if it can, some of these lower priority hormones sensing consistent stimuli (like the empty stomach) or those that sense less immediate stimuli or those that lag behind to respond to compensation are still there, signaling hunger. But the effect is reduced, and so you can easily get distracted from it. After a while though, the strong hunger feeling may come back, when the compensation had to be increased further. Of course it's even more complex than this when we start discussing longer term starvation but this is ELI5 so let's stop here.</p>
<p>Edit: to all those complaining that this cannot be understood by a 5 year old, please refer to rule No. 4.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another part of the explanation is that the chemicals which cause the feeling of hunger (like ghrelin, insulin, as mentioned above) are often released in response to cyclic cues from your circadian rhythm and daily routines. If you always eat lunch at the same time, your body will release ghrelin, insulin, and others in anticipation of that meal. If you always have a coffee before breakfast, your body may learn to release chemicals which signal hunger in response to drinking that coffee. (This is why if your routine is disrupted, you might not feel hungry a the &quot;right&quot; times. For examples if you wake up much earlier than usual, even though it has still be several hours since you last ate, you may not be hungry yet, because your body is not in the habit of starting those hunger hormone cycles yet). </p>
<p>The feeling of hunger will pass in this situation because the production of those chemicals will partially decrease after a while as a function of the same habitual cycle, even if you haven't eaten. This is especially true if you are distracted by something else that regulates your hormonal cycles, such as a nap, a frightening experience, a sexual encounter, or things of that nature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll give a ya simple answer. Your body wants to consume food, rather than use up stored energy (fat). Your body will hold out as long as possible to encourage you to get more food. Fat is the bodies contingency plan, just in case there isn't any food. With enough time, your body &quot;thinks&quot; there isn't any available food and starts using fat reserves. It's called Ketosis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If your question is about the short term, less than a day, then other answers are already up.</p>
<p>If your question is about &gt; 3 days hunger disappears completely.  This time lag is due to the time needed for the body to spool up the enzymes necessary to convert fat to ketones for energy use.</p>
<p>You only produce the enzymes that you need in the amount you need.  but it isn't like turning an on/off switch.  There are ramp up times and ramp down times involved, feedback loops, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
