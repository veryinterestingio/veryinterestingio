		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>And from what I’ve heard, they HELP biodiversity in forests by destroying waste and competition. A Rainforest as big as the Amazon is sure to have forest fires like this all the time - so why is everyone making a fuss out of this one? Why is this particular forest fire so bad?</p>
<p>EDIT: I did NOT expect this question to get this many responses, so I thought I’d summarise what I’ve learnt-</p>
<p>The Amazon Rainforest is one of the largest contributor to O2 production in the world. This fire was caused by Amazon farmers to make room to plant soy beans etc - not by natural causes (which AREN’T part of the circle of life in wet, moist South America). Basically, humans are fucking our Earth up the chutney bare with no lube so drop an F in the group chat for Mother Amazonia.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What makes it so special is that it <strong><em>is</em></strong> man-made fire. There was a small news outlet that ran a piece on farmers talking about promoting a &quot;Fire Day&quot; both to clear land and to show support for the actions of Brazil's moron of a president de-funding enviromental programs. There's a piece from one of the largest newspapers in the country about the original article <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/08/em-dia-do-fogo-sul-do-pa-registra-disparo-no-numero-de-queimadas.shtml" target="_blank">here</a>, in portuguese but it has a graph about the number of fires by day.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://g1.globo.com/ro/rondonia/noticia/2019/08/16/fotos-comparam-locais-de-porto-velho-atingidos-por-intensa-fumaca.ghtml" target="_blank">cities in the Amazon covered in smoke</a> from these fires. Some are covered for days now, this piece is also in portuguese but there is a before/after picture of the same spot in the city.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/08/20/sudden-darkness-befalls-sao-paulo-western-hemispheres-largest-city-baffling-thousands/?noredirect=on" target="_blank">Yesterday, the smoke reached São Paulo (this one is in english)</a> and made the city dark at 3 pm. These cities are about 1,500 miles apart (or the distance between NYC and Austin, TX).</p>
<p>Not to mention, the Amazon is pretty humid year-round, despite the lowers levels of precipitation in the dry season. It's not comparable to California at all. The Amazon's <a href="https://en.climate-data.org/south-america/brazil/rondonia/porto-velho-3120/" target="_blank"><strong>driest</strong> 3 months in Porto Velho (the city covered in smoke)</a> have an average precipitation of about 30 mm, which is about <a href="https://en.climate-data.org/north-america/united-states-of-america/california/sacramento-1460/" target="_blank">half the average of the 3 <strong>wettest</strong> months in Sacramento</a>.</p>
<p>Natural forest fires sure can happen in the Amazon, but they don't spread like this. This is man-made.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/08/21/753140642/tens-of-thousands-of-fires-ravage-brazilian-amazon-where-deforestation-has-spike?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_term=nprnews&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=npr" target="_blank">NPR reported that according to an official agency (INPE), there have been 74,155 fires in Brazil in 2019. About half those fires, nearly 36,000 of them have ignited in the last month. That's nearly as many as in all of 2018!</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The type of soil. A tropical rainforest climate is as you might have guess very rainy. The soils have been sort of washed out already, you could say, so the surface ground is starved for nutrients. Since tropical rainforest climates are located around the equator, they have seasons based on precipitation and not temperature. They never really have a fall or winter season like us. They have rainy seasons and drier seasons. If fires continue to destroy the vegetation in the trees, what is going to happen during the next rainy season? Where is all that water going to go? What about all that useless soil? I guess they think that by burning the vegetation and all the biodiversity within it, that will make fertilizer. But the amount of black carbon they are emitting into the atmosphere will only cause drought for farmers in the long run. Until then, flooding, landslides, more air pollution, disease, death.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just a little note about the amazing diversity of the Amazon, since I've been reading John Kircher's <em>A Neotropical Companion</em>.  One of the things that makes it so special is that a huge proportion of everything in it is rather rare.  It is often just not possible to narrow a specimen down to one species in the field--that goes for trees, insects, bats, and so on, because there are <em>so many</em> different species.  That makes <em>most</em> of them uncommon.  Some of them also exist only within vanishingly small ranges.*</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Virtually every kind of tropical tree that has been studied in the field is also found to be a host to many other species, some of which are dependent entirely upon that particular tree.  How many other species?  Like sometimes thousands.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Speciation in the Amazon works in strange ways, too.  Like the rivers are wide enough that tree populations will diverge from each other on opposite sides of them.  Then you can have other divisions based upon  things like soil quality and pollinator behavior.  At the end, you might have an area of a hundred acres with four hundred species of trees, some few examples of which are found nowhere else.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So that fire almost certainly took out he last remaining examples of some species of trees, and along with those trees went dozens to thousands of dependent species of fungus, bacteria, insects, mammals, and plants.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This does happen naturally, but not on these scales and more importantly, the forest will not be allowed to regrow but instead will be immediately exploited as farmland.  That means that species diversity probably is going to take a hit, and the cure for your grandmother's cancer went with it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Asterisk:  If you want an interesting example of how rare a  tree can be, there's a town in Belize called San Jose Succotz, named for a particular species of Succotz tree that grew only there in that particular bend of the river.  All of the other examples of it were cut down as the town expanded, leaving only the one ceremonial Succotz tree in town.  When it died, it and all of its dependent species went extinct.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Because it's not a natural fire where the forest will be allowed to grow back afterwards as occurs which natural forest fires. These are man made fires for the purpose of destroying the forest and NOT allowing it to grow back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two main lines of thought here:</p>
<p>1) the Amazon Rainforest is fragile. That’s right, that huge forest is fragile. You can have a hint of that fragility noticing the deserts near the equator line in Africa and in Asia. One reason for example is because of biodiversity: it’s collateral effect is that same species plants are more distant on average from each other and will take longer to recover after a fire.</p>
<p>2) the Amazon Rainforest is part of humidity and wind circulation system for South America as a whole (it’s not a “lung”, it’s a “vapor generator”). Remove the forest, winds change direction and raining stops in the central area of the continent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
