		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So straight off the bat the fact that thousands of people get great results isn't evidence for anything. There are a huge number of plainly quack nonsense (e.g. homeopathy) that thousands of people swear by.</p>
<p>So why does chiropractic get a hard time. Probably three main reasons.</p>
<p>1) It is a fact that chiropractic was founded on nonsense. One of the primary foundations of chiropractic is that &quot; vertebral joint misalignments, [called] <em>vertebral subluxations</em>, interfered with the body's function and its inborn ability to heal itself. &quot; People have actively searched for subluxations, and found no evidence for their existence. Even the Chiropractic Council admits &quot;[vertebral sublucations are] not supported by any clinical research evidence that would allow claims to be made that it is the cause of disease &quot;.  There are too many examples of the explicit quackary in the history of chiropractic, but another one worth noting is that the founder of chiropractic, D.D Palmer, prior to inventing chiropractic, also told people he could cure their ills by waving magnets over them.</p>
<p>2) Many proponents of chiropractic will say that medicine has a history of stupidity, and chiropractic has improved. The answer to that is that while some chiropractors have moved away from the nonsense that is the foundation of chiropractic, many do not, and adhear essentially exactly to what D.D Palmer said in the 1890s. But lets say they are right, how effective is chiropractic now? Well studies have repeatedly found that chiropractic treatments are no better than any other approach for lower back pain, and [actively useless]( <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2829683/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2829683/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2829683/</a></a> ) for things like asthma (which yes, chiropractors believe they can treat by adjust the spine.</p>
<p>3) Chiropractors associate themselves with other quackery. [Anti Vax]( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-vaccinationism_in_chiropractic" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-vaccinationism\_in\_chiropractic" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-vaccinationism\_in\_chiropractic</a></a> ) views are regularly held by chiropractor. Belief in homeopathy is also [rife amongst chiropractors]( <a href="https://theamericanchiropractor.com/homeopathy-a-perfect-partner-for-chiropractors-who-work-with-athletes/" target="_blank"><a href="https://theamericanchiropractor.com/homeopathy-a-perfect-partner-for-chiropractors-who-work-with-athletes/" target="_blank">https://theamericanchiropractor.com/homeopathy-a-perfect-partner-for-chiropractors-who-work-with-athletes/</a></a> ).</p>
<p>There are lots of other reasons why chiropractic is viewed as quackery, but this list should get you started.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>due to loose regulatory oversight, chiropractors can do everything from relieving pressure due to back injury which will allow you to function better and move more easily while it heals, to claiming asthma that can be cured by them cracking your back and selling you water that has been turned into medicine by letting a crystal soak in it for awhile.  Often chiropractors find that catering to the people who believe in pseudoscience pays better than restricting their services to the more legitimate procedures only.  The less corrupt ones would argue that they are just giving people what they want and at least they are getting some placebo effect from it.  the more corrupt ones are convincing overly trusting people that their snake oil is better than modern medicine and all they have to do is continue to pay for treatments for the rest of their life for this chronic issue and keep up-selling more and more crap as they fall for the next scam.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>Chiropractic claims to be able to heal/cure/treat a medical diagnosis that does not exist. </li>
<li>Chiropractic claims to manipulate energies that do not exist.</li>
<li>Chiropractic benefits are anecdotal, and can't be reproduced via legitimate rigorous scientific study.</li>
<li>Chiropractic is a breeding ground for other, even worse medical bunk (like anti-vax, acupuncture, and faith-healing).</li>
<li>Chiropractic is dangerous, and is more likely to have no medical benefit or even cause harm than it is to have a positive effect beyond placebo. </li>
</ul>
<p>Thousands of people are satisfied with chiropractic, but thousands of people are also satisfied with tarot readings, the healing power of prayer, and Santeria. Satisfaction means nothing when it comes to evaluating whether a medical practice is based on facts and evidence or just superstition.</p>
<p>If the argument is that chiropractic has a medical benefit, then prove it. If chiropractic wants to be taken seriously as actual medicine, it ought to be able to withstand the same rigorous scrutiny that science-based medicine does. It can't, so it isn't. </p>
<p>By all means, if chiropractic makes you feel good then do it. It just isn't medicine or science, and it isn't making you feel good for the same reason actual medical treatment does.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After my first few sessions I was interested in training as a chiropractor. I’m from a conventional medicine background (paramedic) with strong interest in physiotherapy, particularly around posture and stretching.</p>
<p>My research showed there were two training colleges in my Country, both shared very little information about what they did but were keen for me to book an open day. Information about the wider practice was equally elusive (I’m a big fan of buying text books from amazon on subjects that interest me). </p>
<p>I’m open minded to alternative practice, and I think there is something to be said for improving circulation and organ function through improved posture and musculoskeletal function, but I’m not comfortable with working outside of evidence based practice, if nothing else, the liability is too high! I couldn’t imagine harming a patient and using “they signed a disclaimer” as my defence whilst effectively guessing at what I’m Doing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off, the founder was a grifter. Second, If chiropractic worked, the medical field would have embraced it and made a lot of money off of it. This has not happened because it doesn't work. There are no legit studies that prove that any of the techniques accomplish anything. Chronic back pain is very difficult to treat and those who suffer from it will seek out anything for relief. Placebo is a powerful thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
