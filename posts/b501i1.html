		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;But it was not until 1707 that John Purcell more accurately described the condition as pressure on the thyroid cartilage due to contraction of the strap muscles of the neck. &quot;</p>
<p>Taken from <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320245.php" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Wondering why such a thing would happen ? </p>
<p>&quot;Your autonomic nervous system - the overarching system that controls other nervous systems like the sympathetic nervous system - kicks into gear, and causes a bunch of different reactions inside your body depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p>This is the same system that controls your 'fight or flight' response along with other unconscious body functions like digestion. When this system switches to hyper mode, it first sends out oxygen all over your body to make it easier for you to punch something in the face, or run away in the opposite direction to safety.</p>
<p>To spread oxygen to all of your muscles, your body must first breathe it in. In an effort to take in more air, the nervous system tells the glottis - the opening in your throat that ushers air into lungs without taking food with it - to stay open for as long as possible. In other words, your throat opens wider than normal because a bigger opening means more air.</p>
<p>You don’t actually feel your glottis opening wide. If you did, everyday life would feel awfully strange. What you <em>do</em> feel, though, is muscle tension caused by your body trying to keep your glottis open even when you swallow.</p>
<p>Normally, when you aren’t crying, your glottis opens and closes when you swallow all day long. This ensures that food and spit go one way and air goes the other, with no mix-ups in between.</p>
<p>But, when you cry or are on the verge of crying, your glottis is trying to stay open, but gets forced close every time you swallow. This tension messes with the muscles in your throat, giving the sensation of a lump.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is also a related sensation called globus hystericus, or just globus sensation. Particularly occurs in anxiety and panic attacks. It makes it feel like you're choking even though you're definitely not. Again, it's probably related to the breathing changes and hyperventilation that occur with high anxiety.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What is interesting is that lump in your throat is signaling your brain to be sad. You would think It happens the other way around but in fact the body reacts before the mind does. Often the bodies reaction tells the mind how to respond. Ie- my heart is pounding and my stomach is in my throat, my body says i must be scared so feel fear. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
