		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, Proxima will become a type of star which cannot exist in the universe at the moment, but not until long, long after the Sun is but a cool stellar ember.</p>
<p>Red dwarf stars, like Proxima, are frugal with their fuel and can also use far more of it, proportionally, than larger stars can. They aren't picky eaters, they're slow eaters. The Sun will be a planetary nebula in around 6-8 billion years, but Proxima will be unchanged from how it is today. It works on a completely different timescale, that of trillions, not billions, of years. At the upper edge of estimates, Proxima may get up to eight trillion years out of its hydrogen.</p>
<p>Proxima will never fuse helium. As it ages, it contracts. Fusion rates try to decrease with declining hydrogen concentration, but the contracting star increases core pressure. Of course, being convective, Proxima doesn't have a core, and we don't think one will emerge even as the star contracts. This means its central pressure is ultimately limited by lower temperatures: Convection is an efficient way of moving heat to the surface.</p>
<p>The star becomes a low mass blue dwarf, a spectral type of O or B, and very rich in helium. While more powerful, it is still quite feeble. To the spectroscope, it will appear to be a Wolf-Rayet star, but anyone who can measure its mass will realise it is much too small for this classification.</p>
<p>It will remain like this for a few billion years before fusion begins to fade away completely. The star will cool through blue, white, yellow and back to red. Eventually it's just a really massive ball of helium, looking much like a gas giant planet, but for its lack of hydrogen and its very high mass.</p>
<p>No grand event signals the end of its life, no great nebula nor mighty flash. It just fades and cools, becoming a helium ember.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not all stars burn their fuel at the same rate, nor are they the same size of begin with. A red dwarf burns substantially cooler.</p>
<p>For example, the habitable zone of one of the exoplanets at Proxima is .05AU. Itâ€™s incredibly close and is probably tidally locked because of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
