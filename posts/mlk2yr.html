		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, because gold has an electron transition (two different levels the electrons can be in) that corresponds to blue light wavelengths, so gold absorbs a little blue and the reflected light looks yellow as a result.</p>
<p>Most metals don't absorb within our visual range so they just act like mirrors, reflecting all colours. A few have electron transitions that can absorb visible colours...the lack of those in the reflected light is what gives them their colour. </p>
<p>It turns out the detailed chemistry of this takes you down a horrible rabbit hole of correcting quantum mechanics for the relativistic effects of moving electrons. It gets messy in a hurry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Materials rarely reflect all wavelengths (colors) of light equally.  In gold, there's a sudden drop off once we reach the part of the spectrum that we call &quot;blue&quot;.  This means that colors in the red and green areas are reflected, which combined appear yellow.  Silver, for example, drops off in a similar manner, but the drop off point is outside the range of visible light.  Since the light we can see is a very narrow slice of the spectrum, few metals have such an uneven distribution.  If we could see more of the spectrum, they would look more varied.</p>
<p>Why the reflected light varies in a particular way is more complex than my understanding of physics can explain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While there is already a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/mlk2yr/eli5_why_is_gold_shinyyellow_but_most_of_the/gtlvyjx/" target="_blank">great top level answer for the chemical side</a>, there is another component that could be a top-level answer.</p>
<p>In the question you state &quot;most of the other metals have a silvery color&quot;.  This idea is probably just because you've not worked with metals.  They can appear metallic which includes being reflective, but various metals cover the rainbow.</p>
<p>Silver is only &quot;silvery&quot; when freshly polished or cut and highly reflective. Naturally it can be anywhere from white to black, but can also appear as a pale green or yellow. Polished silver is highly reflective, nearly white. For better or worse people generally associate mirrors and reflectivity with silver.</p>
<p>The raw elemental colors vary based on how they cool and bond together. Their various chemical lattice structures result in different colorings.  The way the metals are finished and oxidized on their outer layers also affects the colors it appears. Since metals oxidize to different colors (metals develop an oxidation layer almost instantly in the air) the oxidation levels can give an additional semi-transparent color in addition to the layers below it.</p>
<p>Iron can appear reflective like silver, but the underlying color can generally be white to black, and also commonly red, brown, green, and blue. With 11 oxidation states and a bunch of potential bonding options, iron can appear any color of the rainbow. Example from a Wikipedia image showing a rainbow of colors just by changing the temperature of the metal as the bonds form and cool: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tempering_colors_in_steel.jpg" target="_blank">image clicky</a></p>
<p>Copper was mentioned by other posters, the most common colors are coppery and green, neither is &quot;silvery&quot;.</p>
<p>Cobalt wasn't mentioned. It can appear as a pale reflective color that's somewhat silvery, but can also appear black, blue, green, red, and even bright pink. Blue cobalt has been used in art for millennia, and pink cobalt is mixed into a bunch of pigments.</p>
<p>Polonium has black, yellow, red, and purples.  Sodium is more of a white to yellow color. Lithium goes reddish. Tin is white, ancient names for it translate as &quot;white lead&quot;. Etc., etc.</p>
<p>Metals can be reflective, and while it's easy to associate &quot;reflective&quot; with &quot;silvery&quot;, they have far more color when you look deeper.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Relativity!</p>
<p>Gold is a heavier element than the other &quot;coinage&quot; metals (copper and silver).  Heavy enough for relativity to become a factor.</p>
<p>What does that mean?  Electrons near the center of a gold atom &quot;move&quot; at speeds that are significant when compared to the speed of light.</p>
<p>What this means is that electrons close to the atom are pulled in.  Electrons hate each other, so when it's crowded around the center of the atom, they push others out further than lighter atoms do.  This changes the spacing between electron shells, in terms of energy, where electrons want to hang out.  </p>
<p>Add to this another effect, that electrons in &quot;orbit&quot; around an atom have some spin.  In heavy atoms, like gold, this spin and orbit spin combine in ways that light elements don't so much.  This, too, changes where electrons like to hang out, more so than, say, lithium.  Think of it like a you're an electron at a school cafeteria, with so many seats at a table, and if you're not cool enough, you can't sit there.  Because gold is so &quot;heavy&quot; (protons), it pulls some tables closer, and pushes some further away, and it changes the number of seats at those table in ways non cool kids that aren't gold can't do.</p>
<p>Combined, a heavy (lots of protons) making closer electrons move fast (compared to the speed of light), and the mixing of orbital spin and intrinsic electron spin, changes the color of the atom.</p>
<p>What does the color of an atom mean?  Well, it's what light it absorbs, vs what light it passes.  Silver absorbs light that isn't visible, in the ultraviolet spectrum.  Gold, because it's a fat fuck, shifts that color towards the visible spectrum, and looks yellow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
