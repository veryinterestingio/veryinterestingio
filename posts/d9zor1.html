<p>Now the finding is no surprise to me, but what is, is that they were able to peer review them in the first place.</p>
<p>Link to article  <a href="https://qz.com/1069298/the-3-of-scientific-papers-that-deny-climate-change-are-all-flawed/" target="_blank"><a href="https://qz.com/1069298/the-3-of-scientific-papers-that-deny-climate-change-are-all-flawed/" target="_blank">https://qz.com/1069298/the-3-of-scientific-papers-that-deny-climate-change-are-all-flawed/</a></a></p>
<p>edit:  I just want to thank everyone for their replies, I did not expect such a huge amount.  I never knew how controversial the peer review process was.  I also know I worded my question badly, I did not mean we are solely responsible.  Climate change would happen with or without us, it's whether we are speeding up the process or not.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Peer review is not a &quot;golden bullet&quot; for detecting error or fraud. It's basically a &quot;sanity check&quot;: Does this methodology and argument seem at least even plausible to someone else in the field? Has this author made really elementary errors or overlooked something really obvious? Does this article have even a possibility of being useful to other academics beyond as an example of &quot;what not to do&quot;?</p>
<p>Said reviewer is not going to re-run the experiment, re-crunch the numbers, or re-read the sources, most of the time. They're not asking, &quot;is this true?,&quot; they're asking, &quot;is this to a sufficiently high bar that it is worth discussing?&quot; Later studies are responsible for the &quot;is this true?&quot; aspect of science. </p>
<p>And of course for most papers you are talking about at most 3 peer reviewers and sometimes only 1, depending on the journal. People can and do make errors of judgment, and there are of course middle-ground areas that experts disagree on all the time (where one expert would say, &quot;go ahead and publish it&quot; and the other would say, &quot;this is trash&quot;).</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for anyone (in any field) who uses peer review to have one negative reviewer and one positive reviewer. (Google &quot;Reviewer #2&quot; if you want to see discussions by academics about the frustration of reading the negative reviewer.) And then the journal editor has to hash out a publication decision from that (accept, deny, or &quot;revise and resubmit&quot;). </p>
<p>Peer review is a clunky tool and should not be confused with a gold stamp of truth. That is not its goal. Again, that's what other, later publications are meant to establish. We don't say a scientists' theory is true because it made it past peer review, we say it is true because later experiments and articles gave further confirmation of its truth. </p>
<p>Peer review is not even really meant to ferret out fraud or error with any kind of reliability. It's just meant to make the bar for publication sufficiently high that journals are not swamped with obviously inferior work. That's it. If anything it probably filters out too much good work.</p>
<p>(As a historian of science I would also point out that peer review is not as fundamental to the history of science as people think it is. See <a href="https://lps.library.cmu.edu/ETHOS/article/id/19/" target="_blank">this lovely article</a> on the history of peer review. And as an academic I can personally relate how frustrating peer review is â€” and I can imagine that those that I review are frequently frustrated with me, as well!)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you misunderstand what something being &quot;peer reviewed&quot; means.  It doesn't mean &quot;this is accepted as true&quot; it just means it was reviewed by peers.  So in the case of a climate paper the peers would be climate scientists.  The result of that review might be acceptance of the ideas ot it might be rejection but something can be peer reviewed and still not be true.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes multiple 'sides' of a debate have legitimate evidence, and not every paper on a certain subject is necessarily trying to be a definitive 'yea or nay' to a larger question. For example, there might be one paper suggesting that solar flare activity is high or that the various long-term cycles in Earth's orbit (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles</a>) are affecting climate, and while that paper might be evidence against a purely anthropocentric explanation for temperature changes, it doesn't mean that the paper itself is flawed (even if you are sure that the anthropocentric explanation is the overwhelming effect, that question may've been beyond the scope of the paper.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are good answers already but one thing you must keep in mind is that the Peer review process needs an initial finding to actually review. </p>
<p>If your paper says that the Earth is actually cooling (this is an extreme example btw) and you are the first to have these findings, you could probably get published. The Peer reviewing system will kick in and others will examine your methodology, attempt to recreate your conclusions and find that no, you're wrong.</p>
<p>Now sometimes a paper might get pulled, sometimes not, but either way the damage is done.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
<p>I'm going to illustrate this with a different example: The lancet Article by Wakefield that proposed a link between Autism and the MMR Vaccine.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Some details: The initial study was 12 children so a very small sample size, though not unheard of for preliminary research.</p>
<p>When that article was published, there wasn't any real research into Autism and Vaccines, in fact autism was still a new thing, so the idea of there being a specific cause that was linked to vaccines (which were becoming more and more ubiquitous) was not a huge jump. It was actually kind of alarming and triggered some alarm bells that maybe vaccines weren't quite safe enough.</p>
<p>Then the peer review started, more researchers started looking into the issues, they took a larger sample size and found no link. Then more and more papers were published and no link was ever found.</p>
<p>So they started scrutinizing Wakefield's article to figure out why he showed a link (maybe they were missing something). This is what then came up:</p>
<p>1) Wakefield chose 12 children with Autism and then gave them the MMR Vaccine. </p>
<p>Which is 1) Unethical, 2) Fraudulent. </p>
<p>2) Wakefield held a patent on a competing MMR vaccine that didn't contain the ingredients he linked to autism - Conflict of interest.</p>
<p>The fallout was that the article was retracted, Wakefield lost his license. </p>
<p>But does any of that fallout matter? Wakefield is still an active anti vaccine activist and his study is still cited by every single anti-vaxxer on Earth. Hell, the fact that the article was retracted is seen as a way to &quot;Silence the truth&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The 97% number comes from several different sources, most notable a survey, then a small study, and then a larger study by John Cook and others in 2013.</p>
<p>The survey  of American Meteorological Society professional members counted 75 from 77 responses out of ~3,000 surveys from 10,000 candidates - 75/77 ~ 97%.  This survey was widely criticised as lacking any statitical validity, and also using very poor questions.</p>
<p>The 2004 study by <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/306/5702/1686" target="_blank">Naomi Oreskes</a>  analysed only 928 papers and concluded that 97% of those  supported Anthropogenic Global Warming.  This study has been widely criticised for methodology and statistical power, but also widely reported.</p>
<p>The larger <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024" target="_blank">study by Cook</a> had the strongest influence, being tweeted by Obama's twitter account (albeit misquoted).</p>
<p>This study has also been widely criticised, for using self selection criteria in the search, to using poor scientific methodology (discarding the greater portion of their search results), not using blind reviewers (the reviewers communicated with each other), to counting paper abstracts indicating certain views which the authors disputed, to finally only counting a very small subset of their data and reporting it as though it were 97% of the 11,944 papers which indicated a 'consensus' when the reality is only 64 of those 11,944 papers actually fully supported the premise.</p>
<p>There have been numerous analysis done on the 97% consensus studies, and all have massive flaws.</p>
<p>I personally have downloaded the data used by Cook - it is freely available, and it is clear to me that what their study did and what they claim are two <strong>very</strong> different things.</p>
<p>Finding:  The 97% consensus is a very effective publicity stunt, but is actually a surprisingly resilient myth.  There is in fact no such consensus.</p>
