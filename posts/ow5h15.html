		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Northern Europe gets significant warming from the Gulf Stream ocean current. This is a warm ocean current that comes up from the Gulf of Mexico and then along the western side of northern Europe. As air currents pass over this they get warmed, resulting in a fairly temperate climate. This is very noticeable in the UK and Ireland, where even up into Scotland winters see very few days below freezing unless you’re in the mountains.</p>
<p>The west coast of the US gets something similar, with places even up to the Canadian border having mild winters as long as you’re by the coast. Once you move inland though the climate changes from being driven by ocean temperatures to being “continental” - the air is traveling over enough land that the land temperature drives the weather. Land heats up and cools down very fast in comparison to oceans, so the summer temperatures ramp up a lot and the winter temperatures can get very cold until you’re a fair way south.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is something lots of people think they know the answer to and are wrong.  The answer is not “the Gulf Stream”.</p>
<p>The main reason Europe’s winters are warm is because the Atlantic ocean stores heat from the summer, and the prevailing winds carry this warmth eastward to Europe.</p>
<p>The secondary reason is that mountain ranges cause north-south undulations in the eastward wind.  In Minnesota cold air blows down from the northwest; in Europe warm air blows up from the southwest.</p>
<p>Heat carried by ocean currents is third in importance, and only warms Europe by a couple of degrees.</p>
<p>Here’s an important paper that used computer simulations to compare these effects.  In their simulation they shut off ocean currents, so their ocean could exchange heat, but could not move:  Europe’s winters was still warm.</p>
<p>Seager et al 2002, “Is the Gulf Stream responsible for Europe's mild winters?”

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I live at 53 degrees north which is at least 600 miles further north than you. But Minnesota's mean January temperature is 41 F less than here and it's mean July temp is 44 F higher than here. You get these huge temperature swings throughout the year and we don't.</p>
<p>And yes that is mostly because of the Atlantic ocean and how it's equatorial regions soak up gigantic amounts of heat during the summer. </p>
<p>Currents carry the warm water northwards and that much of it creates it's own weather systems which work to push against the colder air coming down from the Arctic. So there's sort of a double benefit happening. </p>
<p>But without that heatsink of an ocean we'd have a similar climate to somewhere like Saskatoon or Moscow which are at almost the same northerly latitude.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mainly because Europe is just the western side of the continent it is part of (western sides of Northern continents receive more maritime winds) and is mostly low elevation.  Whereas the US and Canada span entire continents and in their milder west they have much higher average elevation.  However the Eurasian continent itself might still be colder further south than NA bc it's larger but of course Europe is the milder part.</p>
<p>Secondarily bc many large western mountain ranges go N to S from near the coast in Western NA.  This blocks much of the mild effect from the warm Japanese current. Immediately on the E side of even the first range the climate turns continental.  The next set of ranges increase this effect.  Also, elevations go way up inland until the Midwest where it's far enough to be solidly continental anyway, just like Europe gets further E and into Russia.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the Japanese current is colder than the gulf stream, at least by the time its arcing S from Alaska to keep coastal regions warmer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
