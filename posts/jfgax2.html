<p>As you note - concrete is another product. This generally is more expensive but has a longer service life, so lifecycle costs are comparable, but it’s a lot noisier to drive on, which is generally a negative.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Asphalt is a waste product of the petroleum refining process.  That means that even if there was no demand for asphalt as a road paving material there would still be the same amount of asphalt being produced every year.  That means that oil refineries would either have to find something else to do with it or pay for it to be put in a dump somewhere.  </p>
<p>There is literally nothing else that its suitable for and no one wants to pay to dispose of it.  This means that the only real option that oil refineries have is to just drop the price until its so cheap that it outcompetes every other possible road paving material.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pavement engineer and researcher here. As other answers note, it is cheap and widely available, with just one other product (concrete) that acts as a minor competitor. For reference, over 95% of roads in the US are made of asphalt, so concrete is not much of a competitor except in some niche applications (such as interstates with high truck traffic, where concrete roads can have a cheaper <em>life cycle cost</em>).</p>
<p>However, it's not true that there has been no innovation, in fact there has been quite a lot of innovation. Well over 90% of all asphalt in the US is recycled either back into roads or as a roofing material, and in countries like India and Singapore, plastic (from grocery bags, for example) is blended in as well. Even the type of asphalt is different - back when the first asphalt roads were built, it was little more than plain crude oil being mixed in with aggregates (&quot;rocks&quot;). Today, it comes first as the byproduct of fractional distillation, and then undergoes more processing to achieve certain desirable properties, called a Performance Grade (PG). Just changing asphalt from one PG grade to another can be a multi-million dollar investment.</p>
<p>And that's just the asphalt itself, there has been a lot of innovation in other additives that go into it. As an example, asphalt typically has to be heated to a high temperature (about 200C) to be blended with aggregates, which consumes a lot of energy. Today, something called a Warm Mix Additive (WMA) can be added to reduce that temperature to 150-180C, which saves fuel and hence CO2 emissions. WMAs are not something you can make from a kid's chemistry set - they're engineered materials, often nanomaterials, which interact with asphalt at a molecular level. I can personally name 10 people who have a PhD just in innovative asphalt additives, and the total number all over the world would easily be in the tens of thousands if not more. Another example is something called &quot;smart rollers&quot; - rollers being those big cylindrical wheels that are used to compact asphalt roads once they are laid out. It used to be that they just applied the same, heavy weight to the entire road for a certain number of passes. Today, there is widely-used technology wherein the roller can sense the level of compaction (think density) of a small patch of pavement and automatically change the load applied, so that the road overall has a more uniform level of compaction, which at least theoretically ensures better overall performance because you don't end up with some weak spots.</p>
<p>Finally, I'll make one point on innovation in civil infrastructure in general, which is what I think the question was focusing on - it is slow. We are not Big Tech, our industry does not embrace innovation quickly. The reason is that these projects are huge in terms of time and investment, need a lot of experience to get right, have a deep effect on the public, and are often publicly-funded. Tried, tested, and reliable solutions are often preferred over new and speculative techniques and/or materials. Innovations are adopted slowly - a mile of road here, a test bed there. Some contractors pick it up, they tell their friends, who may try it some time in the next 5 years. If it's really path-breaking, it will eventually be used widely, as some innovations have. But if the benefits are incremental, then the industry would prefer to stick to old solutions that they are more comfortable with. Civil engineering is really old - often described as the oldest field of engineering going back to the very first civilizations in Egypt, Mesopotamia, India, etc. - and with that age comes inertia. Story of life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have spoken to the economics, but actually - mechanically it is a pretty great road surface. It's plastic enough that it can deal with expansion and contraction as the temperature changes during the day far better than more rigid materials like concrete (which often have to have expansion gaps between sections, leading to a very noisy and bumpy ride). It's excellent at dealing with water run off, provides very good traction, is recyclable, and can be easily patch repaired.</p>
<p>There aren't many materials that can compete with it in terms of performance - the fact it's economically so viable is simply an added bonus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're also making the mistake of assuming that there is only one kind of asphalt.  There are hundreds (Or more) of variations of asphalt.  Different ingredients, different applications, different qualities.  There are constantly new variations being developed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
