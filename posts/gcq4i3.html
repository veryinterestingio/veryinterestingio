		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, I can’t speak to the psychopharmacology side of things (I only have a rough idea of the chemistry of it), but I can certainly phrase this answer in more general terms. </p>
<p>Lots of people look at someone with ADHD and think, “wow, this guy is super hyper.” If we only focus on the external  behavior of the disorder, then yeah, it might seem a little absurd to give someone a stimulant, because that’s like adding more fuel to the fire, right?</p>
<p>In order to understand how ADHD and the medication work, you need to look under the hood. Even though other people experience an ADHD person as OVERSTIMULATING, the ADHD person experiences the world as UNDERSTIMULATING. That’s why they’re so easily distracted — they’re trying to fill their attention with enough stuff to be sufficiently stimulated. </p>
<p>A metaphor might help. Imagine a bathtub. A neurotypical brain is like a plugged bathtub — it fills until it gets full, and then the emergency drain at the top takes care of excess water. But an ADHD brain is like an unplugged bathtub with a big-ass drain — no matter how much water is dumped in, the drain always takes away water meaning the bathtub can’t ever fill up. </p>
<p>To get back to your original question, stimulants help with that balance by plugging that hole so that ordinary levels of stimuli are sufficient.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone with ADD who's currently on a mild stimulant, it kinda works opposite to how you might think.</p>
<p>When I'm unmedicated, it feels like I'm wandering through a deep fog. I can still think and function, but only a little bit at a time- it's really hard to keep a coherent train of thought, as every little thing around me triggers a new thought, which starts to overlap the old one. This happens like every other second. It becomes difficult to stay on a single task because my attention to that task is being washed away over and over again. </p>
<p>On my meds, the fog clears and it becomes much easier to focus on one thing at a time. It does give me more energy, of course, but it also makes it much easier to manage how fast my thoughts are going through my head.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The research into ADHD is showing that it is multifactorial. They have found many genes that may play a role. ADHD brains have a problem with inhibition of behaviors. Ie. They can't stop from being distracted or they can't stop from acting impulsively. The part of the brain that controls this inhibition is different in ADHD brains. Normally when the brain wants to control something it sends the signal along the nerve pathway using stimulants. Once the signal has been sent, any leftover stimulant is reabsorbed by the 'sending' nerve cell. ADHD brains have been found to have more of this reabsorption (or reuptake) protein so the transfer of the 'control' signal gets dampened. By giving someone more stimulants, you allow those reuptake proteins to get flooded so that the regular signal can pass right along. </p>
<p>This is just ONE of many causes.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ADHD is caused by deficiency in neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine*  </p>
<p>Okay so now here's the eli5. </p>
<p>Neurotransmitters are the chemicals in the brain that do the work of communication. There are others and if you don't have enough of them to bring can't function well. These chemicals control  the speed and the focus of thoughts in the brain . ADHD is not a problem with the amount of thoughts happening it's a problem with controlling those thoughts and controlling what you choose to think about. When you take a stimulant medication it stimulates and stimulates these chemicals. This brings up the brains levels to what a normal brain should have. If you went beyond the correct dosage you would get a similar effect that a normal abuser would have.</p>
<p>There are other medications you can take like antidepressants that are &quot;serotonin reuptake inhibitors&quot; basically they changed the way chemicals are recycled in the brain. This can also help maintain proper brain chemical levels. The correct medication will change based on the individual because everyone's brain chemistry needs are just a little bit different. </p>
<p>This brain chemistry is also why things like excitement , exercise , diet, and sleep help with ADHD. These chemicals are created during sleep and a proper diet will give you the building blocks for these chemicals. These chemicals like serotonin are also released during exercise. Adrenaline will also help ease ADHD symptoms. That's why many ADHD people have careers that require excitement like doing well as actors and performers or EMT and firefighters. Unfortunately it is also why undiagnosed or untreated ADHD individuals will also engage in Risky Behavior like gambling recreational drug use speeding and extreme sports. That is why it is important to understand your brain chemistry</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not all ADHD medications are stimulants.  My son was diagnosed with ADHD this year.  Initially we put him on Ritalin, and it had the desired effect initially.  However, over time the stimulants were preventing him from sleeping well, since you still get the physiological effects (increased BP, heart rate, etc..)</p>
<p>After three months of that we changed him over to a non-stimulant GuanFacine which is a heart medication and anti-anxiety medication and it seemed to work for him.  His executive function is markedly improved and although he still has trouble concentrating, enough of the edge is taken off, where he can develop strategies to keep himself engaged in the work he's doing at school.  </p>
<p>So we're going to keep monitoring him, but this medication works much better for him even at the lowest dose.  </p>
<p>On Ritalin, after his body adjusted, it was as if he wasn't even taking any medication.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
