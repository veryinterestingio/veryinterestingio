		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak to what does or doesn't make your breaths satisfying, but some ways to breath are better than others.</p>
<p>By breathing with a focus on expanding your belly out rather than expanding your upper chest, you help air get to the bottom portion of your lungs to make full use of all the surface area of your alveoli. It takes a bit of practice to get right, but <a href="https://www.lung.org/blog/you-might-be-breathing-wrong" target="_blank">experts claim it makes a difference</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a classical singer, severe asthmatic, and meditation enthusiast I can attest that breathing in all the way through your stomach, which engages your diaphragm to take a breath, makes it feel more complete and satisfying. If you want to master this type of breathing, I would research Buteyko breathing or take some voice lessons for the purpose of strengthening breath support. A fun fact: as fetuses in our mothers’ wombs, we couldn’t effectively breathe focusing on the expansion of the chest, due to being in the fetal position. When we grow up and start walking upright, it’s more convenient to take smaller breaths, so we naturally adapt to focus on the expansion of the chest. If you want to try for yourself, just put yourself in fetal position for a long enough time on your knees with your chest facing downward (kind of like child’s pose.) Put your hands on your lower back, you’ll know you’re taking the right kind of “tummy breaths” (as I have lovingly named them for my voice students) when you can feel the area expand on your inhale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I might add a different point to the table here. While the top answers are correct, there's is also another possible factor to what you're describing.
Anxiety and high stress levels can cause your regular and deep breaths to feel completely unsatisfactory, even though your body is getting ample oxygen. You could breathe 5 deep breaths in a row while following the instructions of breathing from the belly, but maybe only one or two of those breaths are going to feel &quot;complete&quot;. Just ask yourself if you're feeling particularly down or stressed lately, it could be the cause.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good info!</p>
<p>As I was taught with Qigong and Tai Chi:</p>
<p>Breathing through the nose, our sinuses produce nitric oxide, among a host of other benefits. </p>
<p>Also, along with deep inhaling, deep exhales are important also in expelling excess Co-2, and allows for fuller inhales of fresh air. People are often surprised how much more they can exhale when doing so purposely.</p>

<p>diaphragm is dome shaped and when it flattens it gives more space to lungs to expand so does thoracic muscles by flexion (lifting thoracic cage)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
