		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When uncocked the hammer is resting on the firing pin which is resting on the primer of the round in the chamber. If a sufficiently strong force is applied to the uncocked hammer (like say if it was dropped on the hammer) it'll transfer that energy into the primer and fire the round unintentionally. At half cock the hammer is resting on a notch that prevents it from contacting the firing pin. </p>
<p>Half cock was a more common safety mechanism on really early single shot weapons and most modern striker fired pistols completely avoid this issue by not having a hammer.  </p>
<p>ELI5: if you drop the gun on the uncocked hammer it'll fire. </p>
<p>EDIT: Please stop telling me about modern safety features. I know. The question was about half cock, a feature that was obsolescent by the 1890s. Modern safety features are not relevant to OPs question. If the gun has a modern safety it does not have half cock and therefore isn't what the question is about. </p>
<p>Thing the 2nd: Double action and single action triggers are not half cock. A DA trigger is one where you cock the hammer back with your trigger finger as you pull the trigger, in one motion. An SA trigger pull is one where you first manually cock the hammer and then pull the trigger just to drop the hammer. This is not a safety notch, it is full cock. A DA/SA trigger has both options. </p>
<p>Thing the 3rd: Firearms history is incredibly diverse, there are exceptions to everything. I must generalize or I would have to write several books to answer this question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because on  revolvers, think like the Wild West, the hammer could rest on the primer of the round. If something hit the hammer hard enough it could then fire. </p>
<p>By half cocking it, you remove the hammer from being in contact with that primer. </p>
<p>Also they didn’t have a safety like modern firearms do today. I don’t think they had one at all aside from some kind of trigger safety.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the gun design, for some semi automatic firearms, half cock keeps the hammer locked back away from the firing pin so that a bump does not set off of the primer of the round.  This makes the gun safer to carry and also easier to pull the hammer back... In some revolvers half cock allows you to rotate the cylinder.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several people in this thread talk about preventing drop fires, but half-cock will usually also be hooked so that just pulling on the trigger won't release the hammer and fire the gun, so it does also deactivate the trigger in a sense.</p>
<p>For example, in this animation of the rolling block action, you can see the light cyan block is the hammer and the trigger is in dark red.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9qI6ZlPpm8" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9qI6ZlPpm8</a></p>
<p>You can see that there are two notches at the bottom of the hammer, the back one is &quot;flat&quot; and the front one is &quot;hooked.&quot;   When the hammer gets pulled back all the way to the back one, the notch is hooked, and the hammer can be dropped by just pulling the trigger, but the hooked notch mechanically stops the trigger from rotating to drop the hammer.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>The narrated version of the animation from C&amp;Rsenal might be clearer:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A gun works by having a little button on the end of a bullet called a primer. (Look on a bullet and you'll see a circle inside the end of a bullet). If you hit this with a piece of metal it ignites and the gunpowder in the bullet in turn ignites creating pressure to push the bullet out of a gun. </p>
<p>On certain handguns (older ones) you'd have a hammer (the part you see people cocking back on a revolver) which when the trigger is pulled releases the hammer to strike the firing pin or just hit the primer itself. </p>
<p>When you half cock a handgun it keeps the hammer or firing pin off of the primer completely. So there is less of a chance of anything striking the primer. Full cock engaged the trigger mechanism so that can be pulled to release the hammer, but that does not work for half cocked, thereby making firing less likely.</p>
<p>Modern guns do not work this way, and generally have a completely different mechanism. Remember though to always treat a gun as if its loaded, regardless of safeties.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
