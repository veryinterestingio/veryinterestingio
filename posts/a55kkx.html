That's my fault for not expanding my question. I'm aware that eating every day keeps your tongue from being a complete blob, what I was more curious about is if there would be any problems speaking from taking a vow of silence? Whether it be due to the tongue being weaker than what it was when they started so they slur their words or if it has become an unfamiliar movement and the tongue needs to relearn how to accurately pronounce words. My apologies for not being more clear.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As long as one can eat with their mouth, the tongue will maintain their muscle tone so to speak(pun not intended).  What can diminish due to not speaking are the laryngeal muscles.  Without them, the vocal cords can't contract to produce sounds.  There was a famous case in China of a man who lost his voice after not speaking for 12 years.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The tongue is not what makes the sound when you speak: it just modulates it.  And you exercise your tongue thoroughly when eating, for instance, or drinking.  (I.e. it doesn't just sit there like a slab that's being dragged around your mouth..)</p>
<p>As for the vocal cords, maybe just a little.  But coughing, etc., also gives them a workout.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to other replies, the vow of silence is not “one size fits all”.</p>
<p>Some communities have a hard vow where they don’t talk at all. Others have a softer version where they discourage most idle chit-chat but it’s still ok to have occasional conversations between members. Some only have a vow of silence during certain times of the day. In addition, many communities would still pray and/or sing out loud several times a day. So the likelihood that a member’s vocal cords would lose tone to a problematic degree is very unlikely. </p>
<p>ETA regarding your edit: if someone were to take a hard vow of silence and get absolutely no practice making the sounds of their language for a very long time, then it <em>is</em> entirely possible for them to lose the muscle memory that allows the articulators (tongue, lips, glottis...) to hit the exact right movements to make the right sounds. They wouldn’t be unintelligible if they tried speaking again after a few years, but they would sound rusty for a few days/weeks. Kind of like someone who hasn’t practiced their second language in a while. You would mostly notice it in the vowels, because those are more fluid and the tongue needs to make very precise movements to modulate the voice correctly. You probably wouldn’t notice it in the consonants at all as those are simple discreet movements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm also curious about this might affect other facial muscles and potentially the overall face shape. I've gone through periods of speaking predominately a separate language than English, and I thought that my face shape changed a little bit over time due to different muscles I was using more or less of while speaking this other language.  I know there is research out there that suggests that the language we think in, changes HOW we think, but I'm also curious if the language we SPEAK might change how we LOOK! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did one month without talking, and I can confirm it was physically difficult to talk at the end of it.
My voice came out tiny and soft. It took maybe an hour for it to come normal again. I'd guess people who don't talk for years may have real problems!</p>
<p>This was when I was on retreat in a Buddhist monastery near Perth. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
