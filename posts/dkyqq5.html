		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The blurry air near a source of heat is just that: Air. Air has different optical properties at different temperatures and near a heat source there are often large difference in temperature within the air, as hot air rises, cold air flows in and all of it mixes in a turbulent way. These zones of different temperature that shift rapidly cause light to be refracted in different, constantly changing ways, generating the blurring effect that you see.</p>
<p>This phenomenon, often called &quot;heat haze&quot;, can also be seen just above a road on a hot, sunny day (when the hot asphalt heats the air) or near active aircraft engines (for example on a jet about to take off).</p>
<p>It's not caused by a specific gas, but rather by large temperature fluctuations in the air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can see this over hot asphalt, a hot car roof, etc.</p>
<p>Doesn't have to be over a fire. </p>
<p>The heat differential causes air to rise and decrease in density, which in turn alters its optical properties. </p>
<p>Hence the shimmering appearance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My favorite implication to heat haze is what it does to sound. Try setting up a stereo or your phone across the fire from you and walk back and forth so that you hear the sound next to the haze and then through the haze and back and forth - just so you know what it's doing. then just sit directly across the sound source with the fire between you for the full effect. It gives the music a tremolo effect in that it makes the pitch go up and down. It's pretty cool especially with music that is psychedelic to begin with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Schlieren lines! As the others have mentioned, it is the optical distortion of light due to the difference in refraction within or between two fluids. It is very common with sharp temperature differences, when the heat is very focused from a flame or asphalt road (mirages). You can also see this effect in water when heated or even when different salinity levels mix. They can actually use these slight refractive changes to view shockwaves and other aerodynamics.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You’re seeing hot air which has a different density than the cooler air around it. This changes the way light is bouncing around and you perceive a blurry image. It’s similar to looking at a hot road and seeing wavy air coming off of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
