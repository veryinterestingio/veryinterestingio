<p>I thought voltage is just the potential, the &quot;pressure difference&quot;,  and it makes sense since higher voltage will generally push through higher current through the same receiver. But how is it that using transformers, you can limit the current on the transmission lines, while  retaining the same power? If current is the rate of flow of a charge, shouldn't it heat up the wires in the same way, regardless of voltage?</p>
<p>I feel this is the moment the whole &quot;water&quot; analogy sort of stops working.</p></div></div>

<p>Voltage (potential) is like gravitational potential - how high is the waterfall?</p>
<p>Current is how much water is going over at one time - how WIDE is the waterfall ? </p>
<p>Power is what happens to the imaginary single spot at the bottom where all the water falls. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like any product, you can achieve power several ways.  Compare it to torque, which is force * lever-length.  With a small wrench, you have to apply a lot of force but with a long wrench you have to apply less force.  The voltage is like the length of the lever arm while each electron in the current is like a piece of the force (a finger to stretch the analogy).  Your short wrench (low voltage) might take both hands (8 fingers = high current) to loosen some bolt but twice as long a wrench (high voltage) might require half as much fingers/current.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

</blockquote>
<p>You can transmit the same power with different values of voltage and current, for example:</p>
<p>P = I * V</p>
<p>20 W = 10 A * 2 V</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>20 W = 2 A * 10 V</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But how is it that using transformers, you can limit the current on the transmission lines, while  retaining the same power? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Transformers make the voltage very high, so that the current is very low, while transmitting the same power (Minus losses in the transformer due to hysteresis) by the equation above, if current increases, voltage must decrease for the same power and vice versa. This reduces the losses on the cables while transmitting power over long distances. This is because power losses are related by the square of the current, P = I\^2 * R. This is why it is more desirable to use high voltages for power transmission. </p>
<p>Keep in mind that this only works for alternating current electricity, and you also have to take into account the power factor of your distribution system to account for &quot;imaginary&quot; or inductive losses.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If current is the rate of flow of a charge, shouldn't it heat up the wires in the same way, regardless of voltage? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, because the power lost over power lines is more closely related to the resistance of the cable and the square of the current passing through it. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Power = amps*volts as you mentioned. Let's imagine a water hose that is 10 inches wide and one that is 1 inch wide.</p>
<p>If water is moving through the 10 inch pipe at 1 meter per second, and also moving through the 1 inch pipe at 1 meter per second, which would fill up a bucket fastest?</p>
<p>Clearly the 10 inch pipe (assuming the inside of the pipe is 100% filled with water) will fill the bucket fastest, even though they have the same flow velocity, the larger pipe has much more water moving through it. </p>
<p>So if we bump up the pipe that is 1 inch to a water flow of 10 meters per second, our equation works AND the water is moving at 10x the velocity...so now we fill the bucket with both pipes at the same rate!</p>
<p>In this example I was taught that the pipe represents the voltage (high is the larger pipe) and the flow velocity is the amps. It's kind of backwards, but if you wish to apply it the other way around, the analogy still stands</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
