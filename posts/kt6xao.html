Look at the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download" target="_blank">FDA briefing document</a> for the Moderna vaccine, top of page 28.  The curves for the vaccine and placebo group start to separate somewhere around the 2 week mark, which is well before the second shot is administered.  So people who received the vaccine seem to be getting some protection relatively early with the Moderna, as the do with Pfizer vaccine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The 52% protection figure is flat wrong.  It is based on a misguided interpretation of the data.  </p>
<p>It takes about 10 days for your body to build up immunity after getting immunized.  Look at the infection curve from the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/HppDcmg" target="_blank">Pfizer</a> and <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ur2fmkT" target="_blank">Moderna</a> vaccine data. You can see that the vaccine vs placebo curves are nearly identical until around day 10 or 11. We see similar data in other vaccines, and it is consistent with our understanding of immunology.</p>
<p>The 52% protection figure <strong>includes</strong> all infections that occur in people within the first 10 days, before we would expect people to have any protection from the virus. If you exclude infections that occur during that time, the protection you get from a single shot of the vaccine is closer to 90+%.  How long the immunity lasts after a single shot is a question of active debate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you want, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2035389" target="_blank">here is a link</a> to the raw study of the Moderna vaccine. Of specific interest for the question is page 35 of <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2035389/suppl_file/nejmoa2035389_appendix.pdf" target="_blank">the appendix</a> (table S16).</p>
<p>As the study was not designed to figure out if a single dose was effective, the data has a much lower confidence level, however it shows a 95% reduction in cases (11 vs 225 cases) over the entire study group, though the reported efficiency is normally the bottom of the confidence range, which was 91.2%. This includes one person who was showing symptoms when the first dose was administered and includes through the end of the study when nearly all of the group had received two doses.</p>
<p>This matches with what <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-one-dose-vaccine-doesnt-offer-full-protection-2021-1" target="_blank">another source</a> states.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Based on the FDA Briefing Doc, Moderna's first dose efficacy seems to be anywhere from 50-80%. However, like the Pfizer vaccine, the sample size (positives in the Vaccine and placebo groups)  is relative small and a conclusion can't be made saying that it is a certain amount more effective, only that it is more effective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
