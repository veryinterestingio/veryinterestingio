They say that Ayurveda has cured cancer without any nasty side-effects of chemo. We know that these alternate disciplines don't have proper diagnostic methods for most of the diseases because there were no microscopes or MRI equipment back then. Then they say they didn't need all those stuff and they diagnosed diseases just by checking your pulse or whatever. Doctors and scientists, please help me. Thank you very much for your comments and replies.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a study that came out in an extremely reputable scientific journal last year that followed <em>two million</em> cancer patients and their use of alternative medicine:</p>
<p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/article-abstract/2687972" target="_blank"><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/article-abstract/2687972" target="_blank">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/article-abstract/2687972</a></a></p>
<p>Summary: people with treatable cancers using treatments recommended by people who are not physicians are over <em>twice as likely to die</em> (edit: within 5 years of diagnosis) than people who follow the treatment prescribed by actual physicians.</p>
<p>I post this study a lot because it's extremely relevant in today's culture of &quot;essential oils cure cancer.&quot; Because as a cancer pharmacist, let me tell you, they do not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To determine if a certain type of treatment works, it must produce better results than placebo.</p>
<p>The confusion begins because placebo works, and people feel better with just taking placebo. Same as some people get better when taking alternative medicine. However if the number of improved patients is the same as the number that get better with a placebo, the treatment remains in alternative category.</p>
<p>That's how you can understand many stories of people getting better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately humans are not very good analysers of raw information. We confuse ourselves with data, we have biases and we have fallacies. We tend to overestimate our ability to understand complex ideas (this is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect" target="_blank">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>).</p>
<p>We don't really like to think about it, but the reality is that our brains are easily fooled. Magic tricks, optical illusions, marketting and advertising gimmicks, and so on. <strong>They work.</strong></p>
<p>There's an old saying: <strong><em>The plural of anecdote is not data</em></strong>. Anecdotes are a really lousy form of determining if something is true or not.</p>
<p>But don't fear. Humans have come up with a tool to help weed out our bad data and minimise our biases: it's called the <strong><em>scientific method</em></strong>. That's how we know if alternative medicine works or not. We conduct studies and we gather information over time and we <strong>see what the evidence points to</strong>. Does the evidence suggest that this thing actually works or not?</p>
<p>If alternative medicine worked, it would cease to be alternative and simply be called <strong><em>medicine</em></strong>.</p>
<p>If you really want to know <strong>how to know</strong> if something is true or not, I recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNSHZG9blQQ" target="_blank">The Baloney Detection Kit</a>. It's 10 tips for helping you to spot nonsense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a miracle pill that cures headaches. To prove it, I got a bunch of people with headaches and gave it to them. A whole bunch of them got better, so it works!</p>
<p>Except, no. People get headaches, and they go away most of the time. Sometimes for seemingly no reason. So how do we account for this? Simple, we need two groups. One group is given my pill. The other, a pill with a few grams of sugar. A pill that does literally nothing. This is a placebo. We tell the people that they may receive real treatment, or they will receive a placebo. We don't tell the patients or the doctors which is which. Only a third bookkeeping group, which has no contact with the doctors or the patients, can keep track of who got what. Now we compare the two groups. If the patients that received my pill were better able to manage headaches and saw relief faster than the group which was given the placebo, then my pill works. We also get to observe any side-effects the pill may have. If the placebo group and experimental group are not distinguishable, or if the placebo group outperforms the experimental group, then my pill is not effective. </p>
<p>Sometimes, doing an experiment of this nature is not easy. Cancer kills people, and nobody wants to undergo treatment that may or may not be the real treatment, and may or may not do anything regardless. But the double-blind study is by far the most effective way to demonstrate the utility of medicine. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, you ask them a few questions like &quot;When you say you had cancer, do you mean a doctor actually found cancer?&quot; A good number of times, they will say that they found a lump or had a weird mole or something, assumed it was cancer, and treated it themselves.<br />
If they say yes, ask them &quot;and then after the treatment a doctor has pronounced you cancer free?&quot; Sometimes the disease will slow down for a while, or the placebo effect will kick in, and you'll feel better for an undetermined period of time. Sometimes the cancer was never malignant, so they're not going to deteriorate anytime soon.<br />
And then you ask &quot;did you do any other treatments as well?&quot; If you got surgery but not chemo or radio, there's still a chance that they got it all and you got lucky.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
