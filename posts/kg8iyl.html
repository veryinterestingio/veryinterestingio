<p>Edit: to clarify, development didn’t actually start 8 years ago, but rather the game was announced 8 years ago. Thanks to the commenters for letting me know!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At this point, technology doesn't actually change very much. The industry has seen enormous changes, but currently nothing like that is happening.</p>
<p>Take for instance that in the times of NES consoles and such everything was sprite based. Everything had to be made from little 2D blocks of a fixed size. When 3D was introduced all of that had to be completely thrown out -- the way you do the graphics is different, the way the world works is different, the way controls work are different. So definitely, at times like that, it was hard to keep up. If you spent years polishing up your old school 2D game, you might have found that by release day 3D had exploded and your stuff now looked old, and redoing everything for 3D would be impossible without starting from scratch.</p>
<p>But we seem to be mostly done with this kind of thing. The most similar thing to that going on today is VR, which while not that different from 3D games does have its own peculiarities and requirements that can be challenging to adapt to. But it's still much less jarring than the shift to 3D was. Also, console hardware is far less &quot;special&quot; -- modern consoles are pretty much standard PCs, rather than the extremely specialized devices they used to be with various weird and very manufacturer specific hardware.</p>
<p>Other than VR, which as far as I know Cyberpunk doesn't use, we're mostly adding incremental improvements: faster CPUs, faster video cards, faster storage, plus optional features like raytracing. Those are easy to adapt to. Make bigger textures, more complex assets, fill the world with more people, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing to note, as someone mentioned, it wasn't actively being developed, software wise, for eight years. </p>
<p>Any program, but games especially, start with pre-production, which is story boarding, deciding the market you want to push to, etc.</p>
<p>After that it's completely possible for a game to sit, not being worked on at all for years (this generally will depend on how big the studio is/if the team tasked with it is busy)</p>
<p>After that it'll go into active development, and be there for anywhere from 2-5 years (could be longer, but that's a generalization). As for during this time, other people have answered it more in depth</p>
<p>Tl;dr it wasn't in development for 8 years, more like 4 (if what another redditor said is correct)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its like if you have a forest and an axe but new tech is out and now you know you can spend a few days making a chainsaw. </p>
<p>Do you take the time to make a chainsaw? Would it help cut down more trees than the axe? Even though it cuts twice as fast it also breaks if not cared for. </p>
<p>Now i have to conduct maintenance for a few days a week to keep it working. </p>
<p>in the end i work less hours cutting and cut less trees. I spend more hours working on the thing that cuts trees now. </p>
<p>Sometimes it just better to keep using the axe. So it really depends on if you need trees today or a bunch tomorrow. </p>
<p>Same with code. do we need to update all this or will it work as is? Some things must be updated. Some things no. worker gloves and eye protection are great updates even for axemen. but the chainsaw might just be a pretty luxury.</p>
<p>The game Kenshi has a really interesting development cycle that would be relevant to your question. iirc a small team made the game over a ten year period and the engine they used is as such very dated. Somewhere there is an article about that game and your question. The devs had to push the limits of the engine they had etc...  </p>
<p>great game but its interface was very old style.</p>
<p>havent played cyberpunk yet as im waiting on the dust to settle.</p>
<p>chainsaws are legit better than axe though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
