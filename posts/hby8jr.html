<p>It's a complicated question, but scientists have been asking it for a few decades now. As far as hook and line fishing, I'm not familiar with evidence of fish learning to avoid hooks... but if we talk about fish harvest in broader terms, researchers tend to call it &quot;fishery-induced selection.&quot; </p>
<p>One example I can think of is when we fish a population, we tend to select for specific sizes due to market effects (i.e. bigger fish gets better price, etc). If we consistently remove large fish from a system, the younger ones may eventually be selected to mature faster. </p>

<p>Another example could be that when you remove a fish from only a specific habitat, such as when trawls can only work on soft bottoms, their biological characteristics may adapt to a different habitat. This can lead to effects like slower growth, or changes in feeding behavior or  food type. </p>

<p>Generally, fish scientists agree that fishing causes adaptations in populations but it hasn't been explored in all fisheries and is certainly not included in management plans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Fish do change because of fishing because small fish are released after the catch. Fish caught under certain sizes are released, even fish and seafood caught in traps and nets are sorted for size and released. Even if not all survive the release process, enough do to change the fish to becomes smaller, grow slower, and sexually mature younger. Shift were seen in biology research as far back as 1998 when i was in research labs. Some recent <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/06/150626084257.htm" target="_blank">sources</a>.</p>
<p>Genetic diversity still allows for the expression of diverse offspring in fish just as in people. In fish just as in people, dwarfs can have normal-sized children and grandchildren. There are reasons and opportunities where fisheries recover from over-fishing, such as when ocean currents change, sea ice shift, or when wars destroy fishing fleets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Honestly, theres a pretty good chance we canâ€™t know that yet. </p>
<p>Theres some pretty strong evidence that our previous ways of measuring at least the quantity of fish in the ocean is VASTLY flawed.</p>
<p>Its very likely that the methods we have been using actually scare away the fish, producing huge underestimates for total biomass. This is based at least partially on a study from 2014 (Charles Duarte, Nature Communications) estimated that our previous data is undercounting fish by more than 10x.</p>
<p>Its possible that this was already an inherent trait, but some evidence points to this behavior being learned/evolved, with fish/marine animals learning to avoid things like ship noises, sonar, nets, etc etc. </p>
<p>But its really hard to test whether fish are good at avoiding us!!! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
