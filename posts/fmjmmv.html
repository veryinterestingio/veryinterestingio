		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your router has several hardware components.</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrated switch (physical network connections)</li>
<li>Wireless RF circuitry for sending and receiving data</li>
<li>Processor and routing software to handle data-link stuff</li>
<li>NVRAM - non-volatile memory - stores configuration information and system software</li>
<li>RAM - stores currently running configuration and copy of system software</li>
</ul>
<p>The router will run a self-test on its hardware when starting up. During this period, it will give out fault codes and other diagnostic information if the system has internal data corruption or other hardware errors. This takes up time. Fun fact - you can actually connect a serial line directly to the board on most routers and observe this in a console.</p>
<p>So the memory copy rates aren't all that fast when a router boots up either. This is why, for instance, it still takes a good minute or two to update the firmware after you have downloaded it. After boot, It will copy your firmware / operating system and configuration from NVRAM to RAM. This takes up a good deal of time.</p>
<p>Once the hardware tests are passed and the router's software is loaded up, each piece of hardware gets &quot;initialized&quot;. This is the part where the router looks at your connected devices and establishes connections. Things that are wired into the switch (such as a modem or gateway), checking the current bands and selecting the least congested one, and bringing any other software on the router up (such as a VPN service).</p>
<p>There is a lot more going on under the hood than listed here, but this is ELI5 after all.</p>
<p>EDITS: Just fixed a couple typos. I also see lots of people making a valid point that this isn't &quot;ELI5&quot;. Also that a router is &quot;just a small computer&quot;. The thing is, it isn't just like a small desktop/laptop. It has very specific hardware and software that accomplishes a very specific set of tasks. Unfortunately, this question can't really be meaningfully answered in the framework of ELI5. A 5 year old would just have to accept that it needs time to start everything up and get everything talking to each other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The router itself is basically a mini computer.  Just like the computer you use, it has a CPU, memory, storage, an operating system (the &quot;firmware&quot;), etc.  All of these are of course specialized for its job of handling network traffic.</p>
<p>And just like your computer, it needs time to start up after it's been turned off.  During that time it does the same sorts of things your computer does when it boots - initializing its hardware, loading the operating system, and launching various software components that allow it to do its job.</p>
<p>The hardware on routers is usually quite weak, since they only need to be good enough to perform the one job they are designed for.  They run much slower than your computer.  So, even though a router is a comparatively simpler device, it may take longer to start up than your computer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your router is waking up like a nonmorning person- its hair is a mess and it's slow to get moving. So it needs to go to the mirror and see that its hair is a mess then take the time to fix it. Once its hair is fixed and teeth are brushed, it goes out and says goodmorning to the family- Mama Modem and Daddy Desktop, along with any other siblings it may have. Mama has prepared breakfast as always and its your router's job to set the table and pass out the food to everyone. And as much as we all wish food instantaneously appeared on everyone's plates, it takes a little time. </p>
<p>.<br />
Routers have several components, both hardware and software (physical parts and programs). Your router will check itself for issues when you turn it on. You can watch this process with the right tools! Once the check is passed, it pings the things that its connected to, such as your modem and computer, and tries to connect to them, looking to take internet from the modem and give it to anything else plugged in (such as computer, gaming consoles, etc).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
