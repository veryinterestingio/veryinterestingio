		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I envy people that can effectively take naps.  One or more of the following happen when I try:</p>
<ul>
<li>It takes an hour to get to sleep</li>
<li>Sleep for 5 to 30 minutes and still feel tired</li>
<li>Sleep for 5 to 30 minutes and feel super groggy all the rest of the day</li>
<li>Accidentally sleep for 2 full hours, feeling fully refreshed.  Then I can't sleep that night.  At all.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand, your brain produces a lot of metabolites when operating hard/a long time. Sleeping is the process where they can be cleaned out. There are channels in the brain that are like veins, which help take away waste products, and they only seem to operate properly when asleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's similar to restarting a program on your pc. It will give you a refresh, but if you want to be sure that everything will work as it should you need to restart your pc (one REM cycle = 90ish min sleep).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This happened to me without even napping, I go from being really tired and falling g asleep as my desk and by the time I drive home, and get ready for bed, I wide awake and will stay that way for about 10 hours strait, then start to feel slightly tired again but at that point it too late to go to sleep, and then 2 hours later I'm close to passing out but I have to start getting ready for the day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
