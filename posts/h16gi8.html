Sometimes it gets overwhelmed and loses its place. When you turn it off and back on, you reset it to start back at step one, so now it knows its place and what to do next.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you've been given a set of 50 directions to follow. You got one step wrong, but you don't actually know this until you've completed all 50 steps and aren't where you should be. You're given 2 options - retrace your steps to try and figure out where you went wrong, or just start again from the beginning.  </p>
<p>Restarting your device is equivalent to starting the journey again. Except your device is running millions of instructions, and sometimes it's near impossible to figure out which of them went wrong, and it might not even be possible to fix it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rebooting a system generally gets it to a known state. That is easiest to test, and bugs in there are often found and fixed. Sometimes a combination of variables can get a system into a state that contains a bug. That bug might not allow you to return to a good state, or you might not know how to.</p>
<p>The bugs can range from a variable overflowing, to memory leaks, to bad code paths in the source code.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<li>Devices like these are tested before they are released. </li>
<li>The makers try their best to test under many different circumstances.</li>
<li>However it's impossible to test them all.</li>
<li>After a device is running for a long time, it's possible some combination of values causes a previously unknown error to cause the device to freeze up.</li>
<li>Restarting it resets all the values in memory and returns the device to its starting condition which is a state that has been tested very thoroughly.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually there is a set of processes that start and work in unison when a device is first powered on, from simple to complex.  Sometimes there can be issues that arise after one of those processes fails or becomes unstable.  Well designed systems will start and recover those components, but sometimes a reboot or power off, is the easiest way to get things back into a cleanly started and stable state.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
