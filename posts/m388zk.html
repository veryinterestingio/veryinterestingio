		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because space consists of 3 dimensions, and time is 1-dimensional, space-time must, therefore, be a 4-dimensional object. It is believed to be a 'continuum', or constantly continuous and unbroken, because so far as we know, there are no missing points in space or instants in time, and both can be subdivided without any apparent limit in size or duration. So, physicists now routinely consider our world to be embedded in this 4-dimensional Space-Time continuum, and all events, places, moments in history, actions and so on are described in terms of their location in Space-Time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Space and time are related to one another.  </p>
<p>Humans like to think of space existing, and time passing, but that might not be so simple in all circumstances. </p>
<p>A photon for example experiences no time.  None at all.  Time does not pass for it. </p>
<p>If you got in a spaceship and went very fast, close to the speed of light, and returned to earth, more time would have passed on earth than in your ship.  You would have ‚Äútraveled through time‚Äù upon arriving home.  </p>
<p>Why?  Because space and time are knit together.  </p>
<p>The speed of light is a point where time ceases to exist, and it can almost be thought of as a speed limit.  A way of saying ‚Äú<em>our universe relates this much space to this much time</em>‚Äù</p>
<p>Continuum just means there aren‚Äôt any gaps in it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine the universe as a coordinate system. Let's suppose we want to determine YOUR position on this coordinate system. We would then have to use the 3 coordinates of 'space' and 1 coordinate of 'time' to represent your position.
According to Einstein you are moving in space but also moving through time at a total velocity equal to that of light. If you move faster through space, you'll move slower through time because that velocity is always constant. Hence space and time are sort of integrated into a 'continuum'.
I am sorry if this didn't make sense üòÖ</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
