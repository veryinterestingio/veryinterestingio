		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is one of those questions where simple calculations can be useful, but the critical thing to consider is that the ocean is huge so that the seemingly small rate of sea level rise implies a massive volume of water. The average rate of sea level rise at present is <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/specials/sea-level-rise-2020/" target="_blank">3.3 mm/yr</a>. If we apply this to the current surface area of the ocean of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean" target="_blank">361,000,000 km^(2)</a> (which is a big simplification because we're not just adding 3.3 mm/yr to that constant surface area, but for illustration purposes it's good enough), this implies an average volumetric increase of 1190 km^(3)/yr. If we think about the volumes of lakes around the world and ignoring the engineering problems of digging a channel to lake basins, the environmental impact of flooding a lake basin with salt water, etc, this would mean that we would have to fill a lake basin the equivalent volume of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Victoria" target="_blank">Lake Victoria</a> every two years to keep pace. For Lake Chad, even before its drawdown, it was a very shallow lake with a volume of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Chad" target="_blank">70 km^(2)</a> (<strong>EDIT:</strong> This should be 70 km^(3) as it's a volume, and it should also NOT be 6.3 km^(3) as this is the current volume of water after massive drawdown over the last few decades, the 70 km^(3) value is the volume from the 1970s to 1980s as a proxy for if the lake was more filled than in its current state, please read the wikipedia page beyond the header information), so you would need to form ~17 Lake Chads every year to keep pace.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of good comments have pointed out that this would not solve THE problem with sea level rise. But to your point, something like sea walls, redirecting canals, and retaining reservoirs will be used to protect valuable coastal infrastructure (Downtown New York, coastal Maryland, or the Port of Miami for example). This is one of may reasons dealing with man-made climate change will cost local governments trillions of dollars.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I haven't seen anyone address the fact that Lake Chad and former lake Ahnet are ~250m above sea level, the Aral Sea is ~30m above.  Even if we could build the pumps, it would take an amount of energy at least equal to (mass)<em>(gravitational constant)</em>(height).</p>
<p>Taking the volume of 1190 km^3/yr from u/CrustalTrudger, that gives us 1190 trillion kg x 9.8m/s^2 x 250m.  This comes out to ~3x10^18 joules, or about 4% of the world's total electricity consumption.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a picture of what the Earth looked like during the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Cretaceous-Period" target="_blank">Cretaceous period</a> 65 million years ago when the world was warmer.</p>
<p>You'll note that most of North America outside of the Rockies and the Appalachians was under water, as was the Sahara, Saudi Arabia, and large swaths of Europe.  So was lake Chad BTW.</p>
<p>So pretty much we don't need to worry about digging channels.  The ocean will infiltrate these areas all by itself.</p>
<p>If you're wondering why Australia and Antarctica are linked in the Cretaceous part of it has to  do with plate tectonics, but a lot more of it has to do with bounce.  You see Antarctica has a lot of ice on it.  Over 2 Km thick in most places.  This ice weights a lot.  Once this ice melts a lot of weight comes off Antarctica.  That weight loss causes the land to &quot;bounce&quot; up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
