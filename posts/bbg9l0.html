		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Snot (mucus) is a water-based gel-like substance that is composed of salts, antiseptic enzymes (such as lysozymes which can kill bacteria), immunoglobulins (also known as antibodies), and glycoproteins. It essentially functions as a barrier to keep foreign substances from entering your body. Mucus is produced by mucous (notice the spelling difference) membranes in response to an irritant. When your body encounters an allergen, it triggers certain cells called mast cells which releases histamine. Histamine triggers the allergic response, which includes mucus production. All of the components of mucus can be found in blood and are collected by the mucous membranes to produce mucous. Another effect of histamine is that it causes your blood vessels to dilate and become &quot;leaky.&quot; When there is leakage into the nasal and sinus cavities, this can also cause congestion.</p>
<p>In order to combat this, you can do a couple things. Antihistamines can block the histamine response and minimize mucous production. There are two generations of antihistamines. The first generation of antihistamines (eg, Benadryl) can be very sedating, while the second generation (eg. Claritin, Zyrtec, Allegra) is much less so. Also, to treat the vasodilation and leakage into the sinus cavities, you can take a mild stimulant (such as pseudoephedrine) to force the blood vessels to constrict and become less leaky. Additionally, nasal sprays containing steroids (such as Flonase) can help suppress your body's response to allergens so that it doesn't release as much histamine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
