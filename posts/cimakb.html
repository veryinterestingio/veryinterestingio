		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Arcing is what happens when you ionise a chain of molecules (separate one or more of the electrons from the rest of the atom) and electricity can flow through the now conductive medium.</p>
<p>As air pressure drops arcing changes character. The lower the pressure the more time any electron that is separated from either the electrode or a gas molecule has a longer &quot;mean free path&quot;, the average distance it can travel before hitting something, this gives it more time to be accelerated by the electric field increasing the chance it will have enough energy to cause an ionisation event when/if it collides with a molecule. So at first when you start dropping pressure arcing becomes easier, it's much less dramatic when it happens though as fewer gas molecules mean the cascade will have fewer charge carriers and the overall current carried/light emission will be lower and the increased frequency begins to blur into a constant stream rather than individual bolts. </p>
<p>At a certain point for a fixed voltage you stop getting sporadic spikes in current travelling and you just have a constant stream of ions travelling between the two and a glow. You see this in things like fluorescent tubes where after the initial spike it just constantly emits steady light. Is that an arc? I think you have to make up your own mind.</p>
<p>Finally you'll reach a point where there are no gas molecules to ionise. Electricity can still travel through the vacuum though, one of the most familiar examples (I hope?) of this would be the old vacuum tubes you stick in radios and so forth. A kind of analogue diode, electrons get &quot;boiled&quot; off the electrode and move to the other one. It's not really an arc but it is still electrons streaming across a gap.</p>
<p>Does that answer your question?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paschen%27s_law" target="_blank">Paschen's Law</a> describes how (for a fixed gap between electrodes) the voltage needed to create an electrical breakdown depends on gas pressure. At some pressure (a poor vacuum) its very much more easy to strike an arc than in air. At much lower pressure (high vacuum) it becomes harder to arc again. Therefore there is a 'Paschen minimum' which is the gap-pressure product where it is easiest to spark. The minimum is at a different point for different gases, with argon being very easy and helium being very hard to breakdown, for example.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It won't form nice arcs, but you can still have electrons being emitted if the field strength at the surface is very large or if you heat the cathode a lot. They will accelerate towards the anode.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Where I work we use vacuum contractors for really high currents (at largish voltages).  Because the vacuum around the contacts reduces arcing they can be made much smaller without wearing out.  However, they do still arc and wear out eventually.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As another post pointed out, you will not have an &quot;arc.&quot;  A typical &quot;arc&quot; like in atmosphere is the result of ionization of gas molecules in the air, generating a plasma.  Ions are conductive and thus allow a flow of electricity to pass.  In an ideal vacuum there are no gas molecules to be ionized and therefore no ability to generate an arc of this nature.  </p>
<p>However, there is a different mode of conduction which may take place under an ideal vacuum and it has to do with what's known as the &quot;work function.&quot;  This is the concept that an electron may be removed from a solid, provided it has sufficient energy (typically thermal or electropotential) to escape.  </p>
<p>In a vacuum environment, the electron is then ejected from the surface and travels freely through space.  This is used in a variety of techniques for material creation (electron beam deposition) and analysis (scanning electron microscopy).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
