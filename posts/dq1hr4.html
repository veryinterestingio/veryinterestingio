		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The feeling of travel sickness is a response by the brain to competing signals that don’t make sense. For example; you’re reading a book on a coach going up a mountain. Your eyes see you as not moving, as you are looking at a static book, but your inner ear tells your brain that you’re moving left, right, accelerating and decelerating. </p>
<p>In most circumstances encountered by humanity and it’s ancestors, this missmatch can be caused by one thing; poisoning. So the body has evolved a vomit response to try and get the poison out.</p>
<p>Now the exact mechanism is unclear and your question about why certain people are more affected has not been conclusively answered. Motion sickness is more common in women and those who suffer migranes, and there seems to be a genetic component too. We still have a lot to learn before we know for sure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Motion sickness is basically because your brain is confused. Your inner ear plays a big role in the motion and balance of your body. When those signals are combined with sight and movement of your muscles, your brain says “Yes we are moving.” However when you’re in a car/plane/boat, your brain is only receiving movement signals from the inner ear. The muscle movement isn’t happening nor are there any visual signals of movement (especially in big ships and planes). This causes your brain to say “What the fuck is happening?!” and translates that into nausea.</p>
<p>As far as whether or not you’ll experience it, it’s just a matter of how sensitive your brain is to those discrepancies. For people who get car sick it’s usually recommended that they sit in the front seat and simply watch the road (rather than looking at their phone/book/video game, etc) because then their brain can see the movement and that’ll ease the sickness. There isn’t much you can do for plane/ship sickness aside from taking anti-nausea drugs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Im sure its something to do with your body not experiencing what the eyes are seeing (motion sickness), hence why it can also happen to some who use VR and high FPS monitors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Having been through my fair share of storms and rough seas, I can assure you that EVERYONE gets sea sick. Its just the tolerance level of the individual - as an example, I am quite a lightweight and feel the impact of an increased swell much sooner than one of my colleagues. He feels it, but it doesn't affect him until quite a bit later.</p>
<p>Of course, by that point it's immaterial because we've heaved to and are just trying to ride it out.</p>

<p>A simple explanation would be that some people just get used to the sensory/neural conflict better than others do. The rate of adaptation would depend on many factors, including <a href="https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/motion-sickness#inheritance" target="_blank">genetics</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
