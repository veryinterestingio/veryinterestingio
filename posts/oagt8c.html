		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is probably the biggest problem that thousands of engineers have been working on the last few decades, with the resulting improvement from GSM connections to incredibly slow internet, to 1GBps on 5G.</p>
<p>There are lots of different ways each receiver can differentiate which signals are meant for it.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Spatial sharing. Wireless signals have a limited range so each device only communicates with the tower that is closest to it. The area around each tower is called a &quot;cell&quot;, which is why we sometimes call mobile phones &quot;cellphones&quot;. (The edges where two cells overlap get tricky.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time Division Multiple Access, TDMA. Basically each transmitter takes turns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frequency Division Multiple Access, FDMA. The electromagnetic spectrum can be divided into lots of little &quot;bands&quot;. An electronic circuit can listen to one band at a time, and filter out all the others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Code Division Multiple Access, CDMA. I don't know an ELI5 explanation for this. An analogy is standing in a crowded room where different people are talking, and your brain can consciously tune into one person or another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Directional antennae. A big advance with LTE and 5G was antennae which can direct their signals more precisely. Now two devices relatively nearby can transmit/receive at the same time, at the same frequency, with the same code, and still get their message through.</p>
</li>
<li>Non-orthogonal multiple access, NOMA. Because amplitude decays as you get further from the transmitter, you can have a large amplitude signal and a small signal sent at the same time. The closer receiver subtracts off the large signal and uses the small signal. The further receiver won't even detect the small signal and uses the large signal.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two main techniques. The first one is Time-Division Multiple Access which basically means that the time is split into different segments and each phone gets its segment to listen or transmit as assigned by the cell tower. The second technique is Frequency-Division Multiple Access where every phone is given its own frequency to listen and transmit on. Both of these are used in combination. So your phone gets its own time and frequency slots that it can use. In addition there are some slots where all phones are requested to listen inn on which allows the cell tower to give specific messages to phones when there are updates in the situation. It does not make sense for completely idle phones to get their own slot when there are no traffic. Each phone have its own IMSI code which helps the cell tower identify each of them when sending or transmitting data.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>eli5, think of it as your signal has the right color. it is all just photons, so if instead of a cell phone, what if you grabbed a flashlight and hung your hand out the window. you could flash it on and off to send your signal. up on the tower, there is a guy watching and he passes your signal onto a landline. he has his own light up there, but instead of a flashlight it is a flood light and he uses that to send your message back. you know which message is yours by the color. in the real world, it is frequency, not wavelength, and they also use very accurate clocks to send messages in sequence with everybody knowing their own time block. sometimes there is interference, back when i was a kid, they use to put signs on buildings warning people with pacemakers that there were microwaves in the building, but usually things are planned better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people are providing answers for the &quot;how does it not interfere&quot; and those are good answers, though I think we can ELI5 further by just saying that for any given area there are ways to slice up the whole cell's capacity such that each phone that needs to receive a call or data can do so in a very prescribed pattern that it can learn about when it's told that new data is about to be sent to it. And it knows that it's about to be sent data in that way because when it's not receiving some data, it's hanging out listening for the tower announce it has data for that specific phone (not quite using their phone number but close enough). Think of it like a huge room of people with unique names all sitting there silently and some announcer is constantly shouting &quot;Jim, go into room 45-A for your call in 2 seconds. Mary, go into 87-X for data in 2 seconds.&quot; And then only they have the key to that room (too complicated to ELI5 how the keys work) so they go there and listen to whatever the message is.</p>
<p>Sending data works basically the same way except Jim's twin John goes to another big room with all the other phone-people and shouts that he wants to send data in 2 seconds and waits to hear the announcer tell him what room to go to for that. Sometimes two people shout at the same time and the tower dude can't hear either, so they both have to shout again to try again. Jim and John are different people here because receiving and sending data are different activities but they're twins because they're very related (haha!) In the same device.</p>
<p>ETA: on the interference point, you might find it interesting to think about how all of what I said basically relies on everyone playing nicely and following the rules. If someone with an airhorn were to go into either of the big rooms and blast everyone, or even outside each of the small rooms, then nobody would be able to hear anything. That's what jamming equipment does intentionally, and that's why it's illegal. And as for unintentionally interfering, that's why every device sold in the US has an FCC sticker that certifies the device has been tested and it will follow all the rules.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
