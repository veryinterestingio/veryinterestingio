		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simple. We make really long piles that are driven to the sea bed. Then the foundation is made on top of those.  It sounds too simple to be true, but that how it is. But even the deepest bridge foundations aren't actually that deep. Some tens of meters, which is a lot when it comes to water.  </p>
<p>But oil rigs can also just float if the the water is really deep. As in deep enough that making foundations isn't practical. There are numerous ways to anchor and stabilise the rig a floating rig, which can be moved and reused.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are devices called caissons that they construct where the pilings need to go. They are hollow boxes/cylinders that extend from the bed to the surface and the water is pumped out, and workers go down and install the foundation. They then remove the caisson. </p>
<p>This is obviously not for water hundreds of meters deep, though I think they don't  build foundations that deep.</p>
<p><em>edit</em>: further investigation shows that they can make concrete blocks that they bring down and simply rest on the sea floor. Probably other methods but I gotta get to work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most drilling rigs are actually floating on the surface. They are meant to be moved around frequently from job to job drilling wells for production platforms. They have complex ballast systems that let water in and out to account for the weight of the rig to keep her afloat.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Production platforms, depending on the location, are more likely to be fixed to the seafloor. They would typically be built adjacent to land somewhere in a drydock and then floated out to the field and dropped into place.</p>
