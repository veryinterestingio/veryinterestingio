		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The performance increases come from making the parts on the processor smaller and more efficient. They have a limit on how much power they can use and how much heat they can generate, so if they can find ways to make them more efficient, they can use more of the same components, and if they can make them smaller they can put more into one processor.</p>
<p>The level they're at now is so incredibly tiny it takes time to develop machines that can build them reliably enough without errors to make it worth it.</p>
<p>Once they get that solved for a particular processor model they can get the cost of creating them down to something people are willing to pay and then they release it asap to get money back to pay for all that research and development, as well as funding research to make them even smaller and more efficient for the next model.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Simply put, improvements on technology aren't worth anything if they sit around for years not being sold. It's the same reason Sony doesn't just stockpile hundreds of millions of PS5s before sending them out to be distributed to defeat scalpers - they have a finished product and lose profit for every month they <em>aren't</em> selling it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the current level of technology, the complexity and the amount of resources involved, things don't improve in great big leaps quickly. There are so many interrelated areas that trying to make huge leap involves equally huge risks. </p>
<p>At the same time, companies cannot design JUST the next generation of product. There are multiple projects going on at the same time each with some planned future launch dates because these projects take so much time to complete. </p>
<p>With each technology building on the previous one and all these simultaneous activities, what appears to be incremental increases are all the result of multiple decisions and investments made years beforehand. This is the result of the compromise between performance and risk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't always make them &quot;faster&quot; in the sense, but better at doing specific things. For example a difference between older and newer CPU might not be in it's speed, but the fact that the newer CPU has extra functions that can do certain things more efficiently or in a different way.</p>
<p>Like let say that file format .meme became really common few years ago (CPU development and manufacturing cycles are fairly long), so in the next year the manufacturer could include a special portion on the chip that is dedicated to decoding and working with that file format. That is able to do it faster and better, than just doing it in a non-dedicated manner via the other parts of the CPU.</p>
<p>Imagine that instead of trying to translate document using a dictionary and going word by word, you give it to someone who know the language and can translate it easily. In this case the other person is the dedicated function or part of the CPU. It is these features which are better and more efficient at very specific work, that are different. </p>
<p>A CPU might (and usually does) have a dedicated portion and functionality for video decoding, or graphics processing. The graphics processing functionality can also be used for different kind of maths like physics calculations, which means that work load is not going through the main CPU. Difference between a CPU and GPU is that one is specialised in graphics, you can also have, APU (Audio processing unit) which is specialised in audio. Or whatever the developer wants to put there.</p>
<p>And lets go with the .meme format still. The new CPU has a dedicated function for this, well the next year's CPU might also have a dedicated function that does this slightly faster and more efficient, there for you could say it is &quot;faster and better&quot;.</p>
<p>Now. Another important thing to remember is that if this year's CPU works does things specific way and has these specific functions. Next year's CPU might basically be identical but they just organised everything better in the chip. If you get .1% faster times doing a thing because you moved it around on the chip, then when that thing is done billion times, the speed adds up significantly. </p>
<p>But what they actually do to make next year's chips better is a secret. Usually you can get some information by diving deep in to the documentation and comparing. But what they actually did on the chip, is a trade secret. </p>
<p>Speed isn't everything on the CPUs. It doesn't matter how fast you do work, if half the work you do is unnecesary. Then someone who doesn't do that unnecessary work can work slower and still gets the same results. Like imagine that you are trying to dig a hole with a spoon, and I'll dig with a shovel. I have to do WAY less work to keep up with you, and if I want to I can dig the with way fewer actions than you, because my shovel is more efficient. </p>
<p>Since we are reaching the physical limitations of CPU size and speed. As in if we try to make them smaller we start to get strange problems like charges passing through things they shouldn't be. Things actually getting limited due to speed at which charges can move in the conductors. So when we hit the practical limit of &quot;It isn't worth the headache&quot; and &quot;We just physically can't make this happen because physics limit us&quot;, it is more about the race of being better and efficient. Basically making shovels for every use.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Digital design engineer here (working on 5G mobile communications chips, but the same rules apply).</p>
<p>Improvements in a chip basically come from two areas: Manufacturing and the design itself.</p>
<p>Manufacturing improvements are mostly related to making all the tiny transistors even tinier, make them use less power, make them switch faster and so on. In addition you want to produce them more reliable and cheaply. Especially for big chips it’s hard to manufacture the whole thing without having a defect somewhere.</p>
<p>Design improvements involve everything you can do better in the design. You figure out how to do something in one less clock cycle. You turn off parts of the chip to reduce power consumption. You tweak memory sizes, widths of busses, clock frequencies etc. etc.</p>
<p>All of those improvements happen incrementally, both to reduce risks and to benefit from them as soon as possible. You should also be aware that chips are in development for several years, but different teams work on different chips in parallel, so they can release one every year (or every second year).</p>
<p>Right now there are no big breakthroughs any more. A CPU or GPU (or any other chip) which works 30% faster than comparable products on the market while using the same area and power would be very amazing (and would make me very much doubt the tests ;) )</p>
<p>Maybe we’ll see a big step with quantum computing. Or carbon nanotubes. Or who knows what.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
