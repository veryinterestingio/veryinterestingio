		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a professor of health policy at the Yale School of Public Health. I focus on vaccines and vaccination programs, and since last summer, I've been working exclusively on supporting efforts to accelerate the development, authorization, and distribution of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. I serve on <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/Communications/Disease-Preparedness/COVID-19-Vaccine-Advisory-Group" target="_blank">Connecticut's COVID-19 Vaccine Advisory Group</a>, I <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?473850-1/house-hearing-ensuring-safe-covid-19-vaccine" target="_blank">testified before Congress</a> on the FDA regulation of these vaccines, and I've published my research and perspectives on COVID vaccination policy in the <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2026393" target="_blank">New England Journal of Medicine</a> and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Last fall, my colleagues and I - including Dr. Rochelle Walensky, now the director of the CDC - published a <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.02054?utm_medium=press&amp;utm_source=mediaadvisory&amp;utm_campaign=Covidfasttrack&amp;utm_content=Schwartz" target="_blank">modeling study</a> that demonstrated the importance of rapid, wide-reaching vaccine implementation and rollout activities to the success of vaccination programs and the eventual end of the pandemic, even more so than the precise efficacy of a particular vaccine. We also <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/11/19/covid-19-vaccine-distribution-not-just-development-necessary-column/6333001002/" target="_blank">wrote an op-ed</a> summarizing our findings and key messages.</p>
<p>Ask me about how the vaccines have been tested and evaluated, what we know about them and what we're still learning, how guidelines for vaccine prioritization have been developed and implemented, how the U.S. federal government and state governments are working to administer vaccines quickly and equitably, and anything else about COVID vaccines and vaccination programs.</p>
<p>More info about me <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/jschwartz/" target="_blank">here</a>, and I'm on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonlschwartz" target="_blank">@jasonlschwartz</a>. I'll be on at 1 pm ET (18 UT), AMA!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ol>
<li>
<p>It seems the chosen rollout strategy has been to vaccinate more vulnerable populations first, rather than attempt to achieve full coverage in a single localized population and then advance the front of vaccine coverage, progressively shrinking the populations in which the virus is active. From an epidemiological perspective, given that we don’t really know exactly how long vaccine-induced immunity will last, what’s your opinion on the current approach? Do you believe what seems to be a “spread it thin and wide” vaccination strategy will be effective, or do you think there is a significant chance that drop-off of immunity could outpace rollout enough to seriously mess with the current strategy taken?</p>
</li>
<li>Do you think it will be possible to eradicate COVID-19 in humans, either in the US or globally? Or do you think it will remain at some level in the population, potentially by changing/mutating fast enough to necessitate regular vaccination and be more like the influenza viruses in that sense?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If a vaccine is 95% effective, what causes the 5% of people for whom it's <em>not</em> effective? Is it a failure to mount an immune response? Did they just get a much higher viral load with their exposure? A rare or emerging mutation of the virus itself that the vaccine can't fight?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
