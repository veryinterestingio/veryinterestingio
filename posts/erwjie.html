		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Got a bit sick of &quot;probably&quot; and best-guess answers so I did a little digging. On mobile so not gonna get fancy with links, but I found a couple of relevant studies.</p>
<p>Essentially the palms of our hands and feet (glabrous) skin is roughly 5 times less thermosensitive than the hairy skin. Hands are twice as sensitive as feet to variations in temperature, which does support the argument that proximal body parts are more thermosensitive due to their proximity to our vital organs. This is also supported by a distal-to-proximal increase in thermosensitivity across the glabrous skin of our feet and hands. (Filingeri, Zhang, Arens. 2018. Thermosensitivity micromapping of warm and cold sensitivity across glabrous and hairy skin of male and female hands and feet.)</p>
<p>Reading the above made me wonder why cold feet normally feel worse than cold hands though, so I found another study that measured the effects of haptic stimulation on thermosensitivity. Turns out, dynamic tactile stimulation (such as rubbing your hands together or fingers against palms) reduces thermosensitivity. Another interesting observation was that this effect was more noticeable on the forearms than the glabrous skin of the hand, supporting the idea that rubbing your arms when they're cold does make you feel warmer, even though you're not. (Green. 2009. Temperature perception on the hand during static vs. dynamic contact with a surface.)</p>
<p>Although this doesn't fully answer the original question of &quot;why&quot; your palms don't experience thermosensitivity to the same degree as the rest of your body, it DOES answer why it doesn't feel as bad - essentially it's because your hands arent as sensitive to the drop in temperature, and because you can move your hands and fingers to create haptic stimulation, dulling the sensation further.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The skin on your hand is thicker than on many other parts of your body, so it's slightly slower to heat up or cool off.  But counter to that your hand has far more nerve endings than many other parts of your body, so it should be more sensitive.</p>
<p>But mostly it's that fact that your hands are always uncovered, so they frequently are subjected to temperature extremes and you just plain get used to it. Your torso is almost always covered, so it's pretty well insulated from temperature fluctuations.  You may notice that cold water splashed on other uncovered parts of your body, such as your face, is also much less reactive.</p>
<p>There's another reason as well.  Your hands are the extremities of your body.  Your body's core is very closely thermo-regulated at 37 degrees C, so much so that a variation of one degree could cause you serious problems, even death.  But you're extremities can fluctuate fairy wildly with no deleterious long-term effects.  Your body even has built-in defenses, lowering or increasing the blood flow to your extremities in order to trap or move heat from your core.  Basically, you body is designed so that areas further from your core can fluctuate wildly in temperature without causing you harm.  But when the area closer to your core comes in contact with a temperature extreme it's a much more serious matter, and thus your nerves in that area are hyper-sensitive to changes.  Anywhere where major arteries flows close to the skin (such as your inner thigh and arm pits) are similarly hyper-sensitive, as heat is moved much more quickly in these areas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's probably because running ice cold water over your hands is less likely to decrease your core body temperature as say, running ice cold water over a larger body surface area or an area closer to your thorax. Your body instinctively knows that decreasing core body temp is dangerous, therefore uncomfortable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised no one has mentioned conditioning. Our hands used for almost anything, so we're conditioned to except more extremes in pain or discomfort in our hands. And feet too. </p>
<p>Like how your feet are always uncomfortably cold when your in bed without insulation, but you can walk knee deep in to a cold lake/ocean with no pain. It's conditioned expectation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
