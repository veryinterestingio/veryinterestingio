		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because before you throw the ball it is already being &quot;propelled forward&quot; at the same speed as the car. </p>
<p>So as long as the car and the ball continue to be moving forward at the same speed as when the ball started moving up, it will come right back down. </p>
<p>If, while the ball is in the air, you slam on the breaks the ball will hit the front windshield because the ball will still want to travel the same speed forward it was before it thrown.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Same principle as why hopping doesn't smack you into the nearest wall at over the speed of sound, despite Earth probably rotating at that rate below you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You’re assuming the balls forward velocity is 0. It’s the same speed as the car you’re in. If you throw up a ball in a car doing 60, that ball is moving 60. If you threw up a ball and then the driver slammed on the brakes, the ball would fly forward and continue to do 60 while the car slows down. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a great example of Newton’s first law.  </p>
<p>“An object either remains at rest or continues to move at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by a force.”  </p>
<p>Since the ball is in motion with you in the car, and it is not exposed to wind friction outside of the car, it remains in forward motion except for being tossed upward.  The only force acting on it to change its direction is you tossing it up. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Initially, the ball is held by a passenger and has the same speed as the car. After it is tossed upward, it still has the same horizontal speed as the car. The only force working on it is gravity, pulling it down, causing it to accelerate down and fall back into the passenger's hand.</p>
<p>If the car was to suddenly stop after the ball was thrown, such as slamming into a concrete barricade, the car's speed would instantaneously drop. The ball, still having the same speed as the moving car, would appear to fly forward and possibly hit the dashboard or windshield.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
