		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It blocks convection cooling (aka. wind draft cooling).</p>
<p>If your bedroom temperature is above your skin temperature ~35°C (or 95°F), then you will feel more comfortable without the blanket. But anything below that will feel uncomfortable because convection cooling is x10 more efficient than other cooling and is triggered by your body being hotter than the room.</p>
<p>What happen is a part of your body feel slightly too cold, and your body will heat it up a little bit. But that area is now slightly hotter than the air in the room, this causes a tiny draft of air to raise out of that area to be replaced by slightly colder air. This is efficient at cooling and your body need to work extra hard on that area that it didn't want to be that cool in the first place. If you have a blanket (no matter how thin) that gets in the way of that draft, it's much more comfortable.</p>
<p>Hairy people tend to not mind that draft, as the body hair is sufficient to get in the way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From experience in countries with mosquitoes, the cover helps you not to think about that patch of exposed skin. Obviously a mosquito net is a better solution. But I find that the exposed skin is extra sensitive because the body is searching for a touch. Whereas with some kind of cover, your skin is already being touched so you aren't as aware of a possible incoming touch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>I can't sleep comfortably at all with just a single blanket; either I want a mountain of covers or I'll sleep uncovered on top of it all.</p>
<p>So my best explanation is that it's purely personal preference and you just coincidentally asked several people with the same personal preferences.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
