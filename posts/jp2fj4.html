		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're probably imagining that subtracting 0.9 repeating from 1 should give you 0.00000....000001 making them different. Except the string of zeroes is infinitely long so there's no 1 at the tail end. An infinite string of zeroes is simply zero making them the same number.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First reason:</p>
<p>1/3 = 0.3333 etc so 3/3 = 1= 3x0.33333 = 0.9999 etc. </p>
<p>Algebraically:</p>
<p>Let x = 0.999999...</p>
<p>10x = 9.999999999...</p>
<p>10x - x = 9x = 9.99.... - 0.99... = 9</p>
<p>9x = 9 ;
x = 1</p>
<p>Hence 0.999999999 = 1.</p>
<p>Oh and if you think this is a cheat:</p>
<p>Let x = 0.333...</p>
<p>10x = 3.33....</p>
<p>9x = 3.33.... - 0.33.... = 3</p>
<p>x=3/9 = 1/3</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of good points have been made already, but to add to them, hopefully I can also clear up why it shouldn't be a problem that 0.999999... could equal 1.</p>
<p>&quot;0.9999999...&quot; is not a number, it is a <em>representation of a number</em>. It's similar to the way 1/2 and 2/4 are two fractions representing the same number. Other representations of that number include 0.5, and 50%, and 0.49999999... . These are all just different notations for the same thing!</p>
<p>This isn't a reason why 0.999999... is equal to 1, but hopefully it clarifies something anyway. It's an unfortunate consequence of the decimal notation we use that there can be two representations of some numbers, but it's the best we have.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Take one, divide it by 3 you get 0.3 repeating then multiply that 0.3 repeating by 3, you get 0.9 repeating.</p>
<p>(1/3)x3 = 0.9 repeating = 1</p>
<p>Taking another perspective 0.3 repeating added to itself is 0.6 repeating.
You might think &quot;Oh but there's a 7 at the end of that 0.6 recurring, so that adding another lot of 0.3 repeating adds up to 1&quot;.</p>
<p>However there is no hidden 7 at the end because there <strong>is no end</strong>, if you added a 7, you would be ending that run of numbers and it would not be 2/3, just arbitrarily slightly over 2/3.
So, adding 0.3 repeating to 0.6 repeating to make three lots of 0.3 repeating makes 0.9 repeating. Which is the same number as 3/3, which is the same as 1.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because 0.9 recurring is a single fixed value, and not a concept. The idea of infinitely close is a concept based around the idea that a series of values can get closer and closer each step, but 0.9 recurring isn't a series, it's a single value.</p>
<p>Given the series of numbers 0.9, 0.99, 0.999 etc keeps getting closer to 1 without being equal, you might think that 0.9 recurring is infinitely close, but not equal. This isn't the case, because 0.9 recurring doesn't actually appear on the series 0.9, 0.99... it always had infinitely more digits than anything on the series.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
