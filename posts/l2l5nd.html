	<title>ELI5: Due to solar flares that affect the Earth's magnetic field, many sea creatures lose their sense of direction and get washed up. While I understand the direction issue, how can big mammals like whales end up on the shore? Don't they see or feel the water getting shallower and therefore unsafe?</title>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe a slightly better answer:  the flare is affecting their senses, but noticing the shore getting closer would also be some sense data.  Instead of overly-trusting your GPS, think of it like the brain falling for optical illusions due to trying to understand what the sensory organs are perceiving.  Or more ELI5; if your sight says the car is far away but your hearing says it honked right next to you, which sense do you choose to believe? Some animals lose the coin flip.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So similar to how people trust their navigation systems and drive off the road or into a lake, animals will trust their navigation systems implicitly too. Adding to this, whales and a lot of aquatic life cant swim backwards so if they start to get stuck all they can do is turn to try and head back out. Meanwhile the waves are pushing them closer to shore little by little and their struggling to turn will move them closer to shore little by little while giving the waves a bigger surface area to push on. And depending  on the time if day, the water maybe going out for low tide.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the reasoning for whale beaching is not 100% known? Some theories being disorientation, sickness/disease, damaged senses (such as hearing from shipping), and even suicide such as due to pain. And others might be accidental after hunting, as orcas at least have been repeatedly been seen jumping on top land to hunt seals.</p>
<p>This is the first time I've seen it suggests solar flares could cause any disorientation to whales.</p>
<p>Edit: Based on comments there seems to be a lot of consensus on (military) sonar damaging or disorientating whales.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading something about some whales beaching themself, because they are old, weak or sick and they either beach or drown. And since they are mammals, their anti drowning reflex is still super strong, so they rather beach themselves than drown.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This may not be the answer you wanted to hear, but recently studies are showing that ship SONAR, and in particular military grade SONAR is very highly correlated with beaching events.</p>
<p>The whales have mind-boggling &quot;hearing&quot; abilities for water, and we're going around blasting superpowered pops to map things.</p>
<p>We're probably either making them go &quot;deaf&quot; or torturing them. </p>
<p>They are also MORE social than humans, or perhaps any other creature, so when something goes wrong in a pod, it could easily be mass psychosis. (Something humans are testing out more and more, if you catch my drift..)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
