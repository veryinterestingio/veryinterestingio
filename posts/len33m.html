A very clear example of this is a 700km by 500km &quot;fan&quot; straddling the Chad-Libya border. Most of Mauritania looks like it is &quot;flowing&quot; west to the Atlantic, and there is a large parenthesis shape &quot;)&quot; covering most of Saudi Arabia. </p>
<p>What are these structures? Do they have a name?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other commenters are talking about sand dunes but I don't think that's quite what you're asking about. While it's true that sand sculps much of the topography of the Sahara you asked about the really big stuff- and I think I'll just address them individually. But first, let me mention that &quot;ancient&quot; water erosion last happened only a few thousand years ago and comes and goes in the Milankovitch cycles- in geologic terms, water actively sculpts the Sahara.</p>
<p>On to the features you mentioned.</p>
<p>The big &quot;fan&quot; of gray rock is a plateau called the Tibesti mountains. The uplift was formed by volcanic activity and active lava flows started around 30 million years ago- the dark rock is basalt. You can zoom in on the map and see the volcanic craters. Some of the peaks top 11,000 feet in altitude!</p>
<p>Moving to Mauritania- you're correct in identifying that the landscape seems to &quot;flow&quot; to the ocean- this is simply the prevailing winds moving sand around. Much of that sand comes from more eastern parts of the Sahara and some of it goes all the way to the Amazon, where it serves to help fertilize the rainforest. (Bonus: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richat_Structure" target="_blank">Richat Structure</a> is in Mauritania and is one of the most striking things in the Sahara)</p>
<p>The structure in Saudi Arabia is formed similarly. The actual geology making the ridges is different layers of rock being compressed by tectonic activity- but what these mountains lead to is some fairly odd wind patterns. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Location-of-Rub-al-Khali-desert-in-the-Arabian-Peninsula-showing-the-prevailing-wind_fig1_266347514" target="_blank">This map</a> shows how wind sweeps down the crescent, and, as you might imagine, takes a lot of sand with it that fills up the basins.</p>
<p>Hopefully this sheds some light on your question!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically yes, mainly wind erosion and sand in the wind sandblasting hard rock away. But we have to remember that erosion can technically build structures as well because that eroded material has to go somewhere. It doesn’t disappear. These structures could be caused by erosion of large rock, or they could be caused by eroded material depositing in one place over hundreds to thousands of years. Lastly it’s proven that wind can build structures out of eroded material as how wind creates giant crescent dunes in deserts. Structures made by wind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The majority of erosional features in the Sahara are caused by wind and (more rarely) rain. Contrary to what most people think the majority of the landscape is rocky, wind-scoured <em>hamadas</em>, not shifting <em>ergs</em> (dunes). So a lot of the features you see from satellite views are essentially rocky plateaus and highlands shaped by wind and water.</p>
<p>The feature crossing the border of Chad and Libya that you may be referring to is the Tibesti mountains - an ancient shield volcano field. And the bow shaped desert in Saudi Arabia is the Ad Dhana. I'm not sure about the &quot;flowing&quot; features of Mauritania that you're talking about but you could be seeing the series of descending escarpments as you move from the highlands to the lowlands, or if you're talking about the 'braided rivers' appearance in some areas, those are <em>Wadi's</em> - dry riverbeds cut and continually shifted by wind and flash floods.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was  plenty  of open water  in the Sahara  / North Africa within  &quot;fairly recent&quot; times - lakes, rivers, etc.</p>
<p>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The African humid period (AHP) is a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today. ...</p>
<p>The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling-Allerød warming. </p>
<p>Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. </p>
<p>Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. </p>
<p>The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. </p>
<p>While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa the period appears to have taken place in several steps such as the 4.2 kiloyear event.</p>
<p>The AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Deserts, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Pharaonic civilization. </p>
<p>They lived as hunter-gatherers until the agricultural revolution and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. </p>
<p>They left archeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world </p>
<p>[<em>sic</em>   -  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dufuna_canoe" target="_blank">a canoe  8 meters long</a> ], and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The classic account of the riparian [river] lifestyle of this period comes from investigations in Sudan during World War II by British archeologist Anthony Arkell.[17] </p>
<p>Arkell's report described a Late Stone Age settlement on a sandbank of the Blue Nile which was then about 12 feet (3.7 m) higher than its present flood stage. The countryside was clearly savanna, not the present-day desert, as evidenced by the bones of the most common species found in the middens — antelope, which require large expanses of seed-bearing grasses. </p>

In a general sense, there are different types of dunes which can be influenced in structure by predominant winds.
