		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to this study in rats, penis length appears to be affected by fetal exposure to testosterone in utero. There’s a critical window in gestation where the  more testosterone the fetus gets, the larger the penis. Outside of this window, testosterone does not have an effect on ultimate size.
As for genetics, there don’t seem to be any studies. You could try a google scholar search. If you run into a paywall use sci hub. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Realistically, there are multiple alleles (portions of your DNA that can be expressed as a trait) that would contribute to <del><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/f0nck1/does_penis_size_come_from_your_mothers_side/fgwpf7m/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf" target="_blank">any</a></del> most traits, including probably penis size. Some of the alleles may be located in the sex chromosomes (X or Y). Other alleles may be located in the autosomes (chromosome pairs 1 through 22). Genes located in the autosomes get passes down regardless of gender (this means that if the autosomes of the male and female are swapped, the possible traits of the offspring will remain the same). However, genes located in the sex chromosomes are specific to the X or the Y chromosome. If you are a male, you receive your Y chromosome and any genes that come with it from your father’s side and you receive your X chromosome and any genes that come with it from your mother’s side. Since we largely do not know what specific locations these genes are located, we cannot determine completely where exactly the size of your penis comes from.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, not really. And it’s not about chromosomes and genetics directly. </p>
<p>Disclaimer: I’m a PhD candidate who studies this hormonal pathway for my thesis. </p>
<p>There’s a master hormone of sex hormones known as GnRH, Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone. GnRH is produced by specific neurons in the brain and is known as the master switch for puberty and maturation. Generally GnRH signaling becomes active during adolescence, which will trigger the production of other hormones in a cascade that eventually result in the production of testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>Now in utero, the baby is mostly exposed the maternal makeup of sex hormones. That being, male baby specifically have a short activation of GnRH signaling. This is called the post-natal mini-puberty and during this time, GnRH signaling results in production of sex hormones, specifically testosterone. Now the timing of this mini-puberty and duration have been linked the penis size/penis growth. Importantly, GnRH signaling is regulated by nutritional status and other hormones.</p>
<p>So in the end, you can have identical twins with different penis sizes because it depends on both genetics and environment (nutrition).</p>
<p>Edit: I didn't clearly explain this but penis growth mostly occurs after birth. That's when the male baby's GnRH hormones are being produced and subsequently testosterone is being made. This results in penis growth.</p>
<p>Penis growth doesn't occurs in utero bc Mom's body is making estrogen that prevents it.</p>
<p>That being said, there are other genetics (a mix of information from both parents; the Y chromosome doesn't carry a lot of information) that control the &quot;base size&quot; of the penis; how big it'll be in utero. GnRH signaling will control how big it will grow from that base size. </p>
<p>Also the length of the mini-puberty is on average a month long. That being said, that can vary, depending on genetics and nutrition which regulate the production of GnRH.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
