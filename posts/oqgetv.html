		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If humans are any guide, there's not likely any worries for mosquitos due to inability to &quot;hunt&quot;.</p>
<p>The CO2 content in the air we exhale is 100 times the CO2 content of the air we breathe in.  Even if the ambient CO2 was hundred times greater than it is now, we'd be creating little pockets of air with twice the CO2 density.  I bet the bugs could find that easily enough.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, this is not at all to say increased CO2 will have no impact on mosquitoes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6218564/" target="_blank">Here</a>'s one paper on the subject.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/217/4/598/12925/Impact-of-elevated-CO2-background-levels-on-the" target="_blank">here</a>'s a paper on <em>exactly</em> your item of curiosity.</p>
<p>You put these two papers together and it would seem that all being the same, an impact is somewhat evident at 600ppm or 1200ppm but that the timeframe for us to get to these levels might be sufficient for the buggers to adapt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Someone already mentioned the difference in ambient vs. exhaled CO2 however mosquitoes do not rely solely on CO2 exhalation to detect humans. Studies have shown that chemical odors specific to human skin and breath attract mosquitoes as well. I actually was at a seminar where a researcher presented their findings from an experiment which showed that mosquitoes are particularly attracted to human foot odor, which would explain why many bites occur on the legs. Unfortunately mosquitoes are very attuned to locating us. Even if they couldn’t detect the release of CO2 our other chemical emissions and body heat flash the neon “blood meal” sign loud and clear!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, the top answer is really not very good at covering everything.  C02 is only one part of it, as mentioned by others, but there has been significant research into what attracts mosquitoes.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286741400155X" target="_blank">This study</a> is actually really important.  They used special breeds of mosquitoes, that had had their C02 receptor genes bred out of them.  They determined that without the ability to detect C02, they were mildly impaired at finding hosts, but it was a very small difference.  They're able to detect 3 things - Body heat, body odour, and C02.  Their researched shows that if they cannot detect one of those, they still find their prey.  Meanwhile, if they cannot detect two of those things, then they are no longer able to detect prey.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So what other comments are saying do have merit to them, it really doesn't tell the whole story.  Yes, it's about concentration of C02, which is much higher around mammals emitting C02, but the other factors play a huge role too.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The compounds emitted by people are a huge factor too, as others have said.  And yes, foot odour is a really big thing for mosquitoes.  But still, this is only one part of the equation.  Block the human odour, they'll look for body heat and C02.  Block the heat, they'll look for odour and C02, block C02 and they'll look for odour and heat.  Block any 2 of those things, the mosquitoes won't find you.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is obviously massively important in helping us try to block malaria (and other mosquito borne diseases).  We are trying to learn how to stop attacks against people.  However this is also important in learning how best to increase effectiveness of mosquito traps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simplest way to think about is this... For your exhale to be undetectable the C02 in the air would have to be a higher % than what you are exhaling. Which means that you would intake more C02 than you can possibly exhale and die.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
