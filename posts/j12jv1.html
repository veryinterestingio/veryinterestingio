		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It isn’t really about what’s in the rice, but what has been done to the rice. </p>
<p>Rice has a few different layers, and how you deal with those layers results in a few different kinds of rice. </p>
<p>If you take a grain of rice and want to use it for food, you’ll have to take off some layers to get to the good grain. Take off the first bit, and you have brown rice. Take off a little more, and you have more standard white rice. Take off even more, and you have just the innermost layer that cooks much faster. </p>
<p>Additionally, the producers will cook this milled down rice, then dehydrate the grains before packaging. This is what allows you to cook it quickly, as all you really need to accomplish is rehydration. </p>
<p>It also removes nearly all the nutrition available in rice. This is why a lot of instant rice is also “enriched” with added vitamins/minerals</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have mentioned, the rice is cooked, or partially cooked in a way that cracks the starchy outer layers and allows it to absorb water much more quickly. </p>
<p>One interesting tidbit: if you attempt to salvage a water-damaged electronic device by placing it in a container of rice, use instant rice. It absorbs water much more effectively than traditional rice. (But really, do yourself a favor and go get some crystal style cat litter, which is made of silica gel, and is way better than rice)</p>
<p>Edit: I’ve been reminded by some helpful redditors that using rice to rescue electronics is generally a bad idea. In fact, open air is generally more effective than a container of rice. Here’s a helpful article from a few years back that describes tests of several alternative methods. <a href="https://www.gazelle.com/thehorn/2014/05/06/gazelles-guide-water-damage-truth-rice-galaxy-everything/" target="_blank">https://www.gazelle.com/thehorn/2014/05/06/gazelles-guide-water-damage-truth-rice-galaxy-everything/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is precooked. Dry heated in a 400 deg C air blower, then wet down with water, then dry heated in a 300 deg C blower. Source: used to make this rice for Uncle Ben's. The intermediate wet down was a breakthrough and allowed the cutdown from 8 min rice to 3 min rice. The resulting rice is way more fragile than normal rice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
