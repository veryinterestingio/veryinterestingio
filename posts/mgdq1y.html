<p>Stars can't fuse past iron because iron-56 has the lowest mass per nucleon, and so no energy can be released (by E=mc^(2)) from fusion- it's basically nuclear ash and all possible energy for nuclear reactions has been spent. </p>
<p>Magnetism is not a nuclear physics phenomena, but an atomic physics phenomena. 'Ferromagnetism,' the kind of permanent magnetism you're used to experiencing in iron, is a consequence of the structure of the atomic electron orbitals and their occupations. </p>
<p>Point being- one is a nuclear physics phenomena and the other is an 'electron' physics phenomena</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are not related, not to first order at least. One could <em>maybe</em> speculate that the energy cost for nuclear fusion has some simple relationship to the number of nucleons, which can then directly relate to how many electrons are in a neutral atom, and then relate that to orbital occupancies in the solid state, and so on. That's probably too convoluted and not relevant, but it's what I would fish for if I had to really try to tie these two together.</p>
<p>Practically speaking however, these are two separate phenomenon. Spontaneity of fusion reactions deal with the binding energy of the nuclei; magnetism deals with whether or not the atom has an unpaired electron when in the solid state, and the interactions with the other atoms around it. </p>
<p>It's also useful to add that the (ferro)magnetism that you mention is highly dependent on the solid state. This means that the magnetism itself is a many-body phenomenon (multiple of atoms participating) and depends on the relative orientation. Why this is the case is because magnetism, at the large scale, needs the electron spins (tiny N/S fridge magnets) to talk to each other so they know how to behave when they are around each other. </p>
<p>For certain materials, the correct combination of orientation, which is related to bond angles and distances, along with the availability of unpaired spins, gives us a ferromagnet if the spins align. Note that this can also lead to spins that are aligned <em>opposite</em> to each other, which gives us what the layman would call &quot;non-magnetic&quot;, but is rather an antiferromagnetic!</p>
<p>Magnetism in the solid state has quite a lot of depth, and there are many more exotic forms of how spins can align, but the above is the gist of the basic ideas/forms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
