		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is <em>exactly</em> the line of thinking which started Einstein on the path to relativity. His solution was to posit that the speed of light <em>is</em> infinite from the standpoint of the universe. This is why it is never possible to exceed, or even reach, the speed of light in a vacuum. So it’s less that the speed of light is a cosmic speed limit that nothing can ever surpass, and more that it’s a cosmic horizon that nothing can ever catch up to.</p>
<p>The triumph of relativity is in explaining why it is that light doesn’t instantaneously propagate between two points in space. How it does this gets quite complicated, but one way to think about it is that the time it takes light to move from one point to another is actually the time it takes for space time itself to change to accommodate a changed state in some other location. The propagation of changes in space time itself is what gives light its perceived velocity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, as it turns out, no time passes when traveling at the speed of light.  Imagine that a little photon of light has intelligence and understands the passage of time.  From the moment it's emitted from a distant star in some far-off galaxy to the moment it hits our upper atmosphere and slows down a little, <em>no time whatsoever passes for it</em>.  From its perspective, it did have &quot;infinite velocity&quot;.  </p>
<p>Photons, of course, don't have intelligence.  And anything that could can never travel at the speed of light, because it would have mass, and to reach light speed the mass would become infinite, as would the amount of energy required to accelerate it a little more towards light speed.  </p>
<p>So if light traveling in a vacuum experiences any distance in no time (i.e. close enough to &quot;infinite velocity&quot;), why do we think it has a measurable velocity?  That's where the special relativity comes in that others have replied about, where the warping of time and space results in a velocity determined by universal constants regardless of the relative velocity of the observer.    </p>
<p>Here's another take on the same thing I just posted.  He uses the same analogy (I swear I didn't copy his):<br />

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe a more simple approach. Velocity affects time. At the speed of light you don't experience time. You arrive in an instant. So as time goes, photons never experience time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
