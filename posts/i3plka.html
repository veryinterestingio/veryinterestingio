	<title>ELI5: I heard of the case of Adam Rainer, where his apparent condition called &quot;acromegaly&quot; caused him to grow uncontrollably beyond adolescence. He was both a dwarf at 19 and a giant at 33. How is this possible if growth plates predetermine height?</title>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have acromegaly, but I did have osteosarcoma, a type of cancer.  Normally during development you growth plates make cartilage and calcify that cartilage into bone at roughly equal rates, basically parallel to one another, moving up the bone.  This causes bones to grow longer (wider is a bit different process).  Eventually when your body reaches the determined size, through a combination of genetics, diet, and environmental factors, the rate of calcification of cartilage increases and catches up and overtakes the new cartilage growth which causes those cartilage producing cells to stop producing more cartilage and causing no new growth.  If you look at many of the long bones of the body you can usually see this line where the end of the bone and the new growth of the bone fused together, especially internally.</p>
<p>In my case, there was some mutations in my left growth plate of my arm that caused that increase of calcification to never happen and it just kept growing.  I had to have chemotherapy and surgery to remove my humerus (which is why I'm not very funny anymore :D).  This hopefully gives you a bit of an insight to how this could happen.  Adam Rainer was unlucky enough to have a mutation that affected many if not all of their growth plates causing them to never completey fuse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Growth plates are areas of bone where growth occurs. Normally at the end of puberty the &quot;plates&quot; are converted from active sites of cellular growth to &quot;regular&quot; bone.</p>
<p>In disorders that result in continuous long bone growth this never occurs. The plates remain active more or less indefinitely.</p>
<p>Height isn't really predetermined. It's a complex product of genetics and environmental factors.</p>
<p>Edited: Because acromegaly doesn't technically leave growth plates active. Point really is that growth plates don't directly predetermine height.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Acromegaly is due to excess growth hormone after adolescence.... Probably due to a pituitary tumour.... If the Growth hormone excess happened before adolescence it would be Gigantism.... And the deficiency would be dwarfism...
Adam was the only person recorded to be dwarf during adolescence and giant afterwards.... However acromegaly Giants are different than Gigantism Giants. Gigantism the growth is proportionate.... But in acromegaly the growth in mainly in the limbs and face ..
So, if we have to speculate.... Probably a pituitary adenoma that caused decreased production of Growth hormone or due to nutritional and environmental factors.... Caused dwarfism.... After that the changes in the same pituitary tumour or a new one after adolescence... Caused increased production causing Acromegaly. I know it sounds unlikely but possible... Maybe that's why it's the only recorded case... Now the time of the maturation of the growth plates can vary(epiphyseal fusion), hence an increased growth hormone can cause increase in height even after adolescence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Acromegaly is the condition where the pituitary gland has a non cancerous tumor on it and is common in middle aged men.  So excessive growth occurs because too much growth hormone is secreted.</p>
<p>Every aspect of growth is controlled from that single gland and when the body needs to grow it sends out a signal  from this tiny gland to the rest of the body to grow. The tumor causes a malfunction in the gland and tells the gland to secrete more growth hormones when normally it shouldn't be over secreting them.</p>
<p>The only way to stop it is to have surgery to cut out the tumor or have radiation treatment done to kill the tumor cells.  </p>
<p>Most doctors will do an operation through your nose to get at the pituitary gland but in some cases cannot remove all of it which requires more treatments. </p>
