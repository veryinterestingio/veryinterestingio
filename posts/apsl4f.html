		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your ISP likely gets its internet connection from another ISP. That ISP may also get its internet connection from another ISP.  ISPs are generally considered  Tier 1, 2, or 3.</p>
<p>Your ISP is likely what is considered a Tier 3 ISP meaning they focus on providing the last mile to internet users. They then likely connect to another much larger provider who also connects other Tier 3 providers.  This provider is generally considered a Tier 2 and then connects to a Tier 1 which are your backbone Internet providers. </p>
<p>Tier 1 providers don't actually pay for service. They have invested so much into their infrastructure and are so large that they enter into agreements with other Tier 1 providers to form the backbone of the internet. Tier 2 providers may blur the line between 1 and 2 and enter into similar agreements or may pay for service from a Tier 1 provider. </p>
<p>Edit: 1 exception to this is Comcast which blurs the line between all 3. Also ATT, Sprint, and Verizon are considered Tier 1.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>When you go online, you form a tiny part of the internet, and could be a tiny ISP as well. In fact you pretty much are if you run a wireless access point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer given by /u/nmbgeek is mostly correct (and would have been completely correct 4-8 years ago).</p>
<p>Today with the emergence of IXPs (Internet eXchange Points) even the smaller ISP's are getting on on settlement-free peering (not having to pay for all of their traffic)</p>
<p>Let's take this from the perspective of a smaller regional ISP (which would have been a Tier3.) We serve around 8000 homes and use ~15Gbps of 'Internet'.</p>
<p>Being in the middle of nowhere, we have very limited local options to get our Internet from.  So we buy some access from a larger regional Tier 2 on our border just as in /u/nmbgeek's example (which is mostly only used if our other connection detailed below has an issue as a backup).</p>
<p>We also lease a dark fiber (a fiber cable with nothing on it that a different company owns, and allows us to put whatever we want at each end) that gets us connected into a major IXP, this could be 100's of miles away.</p>
<p>Once we are connected to this IXP we have two connections, one that is paid directly to a 'Tier 1' provider, but more importantly a connection on the 'exchange'.</p>
<p>Once on the exchange we can set up 'peering agreements' with all of the major sources of traffic, Netflix, Google (YouTube), Amazon, Steam Etc. that allows them to send us traffic directly at no cost (other than getting to, and onto the exchange) since they also get to have that traffic bypass their ISP to get to us.</p>
<p>Since most of the traffic comes from sources that allow this peering, we can get away with about 60-80% of our traffic coming from the exchange.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Internet is weird. Companies put wires in the ground. But no one company could ever put a wire in the ground to all homes and businesses. Typically companies like ATT and Comcast have wires in the ground out to the customer. But those companies aren't &quot;the internet&quot;. The wires to your home or business lead back to a POP.  (point of presence). This is where all the ISPs hang out and exchange information. Kind of like an airport with different airlines shuffling traffic around. So you have a local carrier like ATT that all your friends an neighbors go through. And they end up going back to a POP. Where the traffic is then sent across the backbone of the internet. It might be ATTs network, or Comcast's, or Level 3, etc. Depends on the best route. There is a lot of co-dependence to make the internet work. Typically different internet providers lease circuits from other providers. That circuit is then a main point of entry into other providers networks. You might have Comcast, but Comcast has contracts for a 10GB circuit to ATT for the long haul traffic to certain subnets.</p>
<p>In short. It's a giant fucking mess and depends on how many cables a particular company has in the ground. ISPs lease other ISPs cables all of the time. (and that's why I laugh when I read complaints about ISPs... alot of the time, people aren't even complaining about which ISP is actually responsible in reality...they just complain about the ISP that's charging them money..which is valid I guess.....but thoroughly hilarious when they threaten to change providers to ATT, when ATT was the problem all along)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Each other, mostly. In concept, the Internet is just a collection of <em>inter</em>connected <em>net</em>works. ISPs are all hooked up to each other's networks, so every datacenter and PC in the world can talk to each other regardless of who their internet provider is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
