		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they both attract attention.  A warning isn't very effective unless it can be seen, so the bright colors in frogs allow animals to clearly identify the frog and learn/know the danger associated with disturbing it. This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aposematism" target="_blank">aposematic coloring.</a></p>
<p>Similarly, animals that are drawn to the bright colors in fruit can learn that those plants make good food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also fruits are only brightly colored to birds and primates.  Many animals are unable to see shades of red, a pigment which evolved in ripened fruits to signal a simple, sugary energy source that has the side effect of seed scattering.  Birds have the longest ranges of most animals, so they are the intended target, but primates evolved red-green color perception to enter that niche as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you divide all colors in nature into “bright” and “dull”, you’ll find that the “bright” colors are the ones used to communicate, and can communicate all kinds of things.  Bright colors draw attention to themselves by virtue of being different than their surroundings, so they’re the ones useful for communicating information.  </p>
<p>It’s the same reason traffic signs are bright colors instead of the same colors as the landscapes around them. And like in nature, sometimes those bright colors mean go, and sometimes they mean stop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I don't actually know why, I just want to apologise for all the people who are explaining that a animals use bright colours as warning signs and that plants use them to attract animals. You obviously already know both of those things, and want to know why the same trait, bright colour, has two effects that are opposites. I apologise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Funny thing about the frogs, they aren't brightly colored as a warning sign.  Take the poison dart frog for example, they themselves aren't actually poisonous.  They secrete the poison due to the insects they eat.  If you take a poison dart frog out of their environment and feed them different insects, they no longer secrete the poison.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
