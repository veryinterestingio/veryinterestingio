		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Numbness isn’t always tied to lack of blood flow like has been described. A nerve itself can be compressed or pinched or otherwise impaired so that signals can’t properly be sent. Like if you slip a disc in your back and a nerve is pinched. Or if you get inflammation in your wrist from overuse and the swelling puts pressure on the nerve.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Numbness broadly is caused by nerves being unable to convey signals properly. Commonly this can be caused by a restriction in blood flow that starves the nerves of oxygen and limits their ability to function (hopefully temporarily).</p>
<p>If blood flow is restricted enough to cause sensory nerves to be limited in function then it is likely this also impacted the nerves that carry signals to tell the muscles to move the limb as well. This would explain why the body part is difficult to move, and it may also be the case that the muscles themselves are somewhat low on oxygen similar to the nerves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body needs oxygen to function.</p>
<p>Stop the blood flow to an extremity and it's kind of like powering off everything which is  connected to the nerves.</p>
<p>Once circulation is restored it takes a varying amount of time for the nerves to re-establish proper communication which gives the odd tingling sensations. Muscles need oxygen to function as well so until the oxygen saturates all the tissues they can seem sluggish or unresponsive.</p>
<p>There are some more complicated chemical reactions going on here but it's basically just waiting on your body parts to reboot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Numbness usually means your nerves aren't carrying information about touch from some part of your body back to your brain. The nerves that carry information about touch back to the brain are built about the same way as the nerves that carry instructions to move from the brain, so things that interfere with one will often interfere with the other too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
