		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let me introduce you to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Ridge,_Tennessee" target="_blank">Oak Ridge, TN</a>.  </p>
<p>In 1942 the US <strong>built an entire city</strong> just for the purpose of enriching Uranium for the Manhattan project.  They used <strong>60,000 acres</strong> to build the necessary factories, and <strong>70,000</strong> people were housed in Oak Ridge to build and operate the factories.  All told, this 3 year effort only produced enough enriched Uranium (about 100 lbs) for <strong>ONE BOMB</strong> (the other two bombs were plutonium based) by the end of the war.</p>
<p>Now, I imagine that current technology has probably advanced this process somewhat, but it is still something that has to occur on a massive industrial scale.  You can't hide construction like this from a spy satellite.  And you can't hide purchases of some of the specialized materials needed to build the equipment.  And you have to buy the raw materials from somewhere - raw Uranium is fairly rare and its purchase is carefully tracked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Enriching uranium requires you to take the rare U-235 out from the common U-238 and discard the rest.</p>
<p>Firstly, you will need to purchase large amounts of uranium. This is pretty obvious to look for, everybody will know when large quantities are being shipped to/within your country. Unless your processing lab happens to sit on an undiscovered uranium mine you can’t access it.</p>
<p>Secondly, you will generate a lot of radioactive waste (the common U-238). You need to dispose of it somewhere, preferably away from the population centres and where your processing lab is. This can be easily detected by satellites / random people with Geiger counters. The trucks used to transport the waste, personnel and equipment all need to be decontaminated which is near impossible to cover up.</p>
<p>Thirdly, you will need to hire nuclear Engineers. Oh suddenly all the nuclear Engineers in the country started working for the military/disappeared? Pretty big sign of a nuclear program. You also need very specialized centrifuges and chemicals which again can be easily tracked internationally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, you'll need quite a bit of uranium, likely more than your own country could mine in a few years time, unless you're in North America which has large reserves.</p>
<p>Natural uranium contains only 0.72% of the isotope U-235, which is the one that can undergo fission, and the one that is useful for power reactors and weapons.</p>
<p>Except for microscopic traces of other isotopes, the rest is U-238 which is not directly useful in weapons or reactors</p>
<p>(However U-238 can slowly be converted into plutonium by absorbing excess neutrons.)</p>
<p>So, to produce, say, 100 kg of material that is highly enriched in U-235, you would need a very minimum:</p>
<p>100kg/.007 = 13,889 kg.</p>
<p>In reality you will need at least an order of magnitude more than this since the enrichment process is highly inefficient. Weapons grade material needs to be about 2/3 U-235.</p>
<p>So, importing dozens or hundreds of tons of uranium ore concentrates (&quot;yellocake&quot;) is likely to raise a few eyebrows.</p>
<p>The second problem is that various enrichment processes require some pretty specific metals and materials. Enrichment involves converting the uranium into corrosive uranium hexafluoride, then vaporizing it into a gas. </p>
<p>The most common technique is the gas ultracentrifuge. This involves spinning the hot gas at a moderate vacuum, at incredibly high speed. The cylinders need to be fabricated and machined with the utmost precision and need to be perfectly balanced, otherwise they self destruct when spun up. It turns out that a special Cobalt-containing steel called &quot;maraging steel&quot; is the only material with the right combination of properties.  So if you start trying to buy that stuff on the down-low, the International Atomic Energy Agency takes notice.</p>
<p>Even still, the separation factor for one cylinder is low, so you need thousands of cylinders and hundreds of tons of metals and piping.</p>
<p>Seal and gasket materials for process pipes and pumps also need to be made from rather specific materials to withstand the hot corrosive gas. You can't just buy the stuff from hardware stores.</p>
<p>Then there's the fact that enrichment requires huge amounts of electricity. If you build a large power plant and transmission lines, buy a bunch of electrical  switching  equipment, but don't connect it to a known city or group of legit business, that's going to be pretty suspicious.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Enriching uranium requires doing very small amounts of activity on a very large scale. You're literally sorting atoms into &quot;heavy&quot; and &quot;slightly less heavy&quot; piles. Every machine you run the atoms through separates them by a tiny, tiny amount. So to change the overall percentage of &quot;slightly less heavy&quot; atoms (U-235) from less than 1% to 90% or so, and to do so in a reasonable amount of time (e.g., not a thousand years), you need a very large factory that takes a lot of electricity. </p>
<p>That size and electricity profile has made it possible to detect these factories from a distance — when you see a massive building that takes a massive amount of electricity and practically nothing is made by it, then you might ask what they're doing there, if you're already suspicious. Once you are suspicious there are other ways to verify it (e.g., taking a soil sample nearby, because trace amounts of uranium are often very detectable, just because of the large amounts of uranium gas that these plants handle).</p>
<p>Now there is a historical caveat here. The early methods for doing this were <em>huge</em>. It's very hard to hide a gaseous diffusion plant, for example. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/K-25_%287609929206%29.jpg" target="_blank">Here's the first one ever made</a>; here's a <a href="https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/uk/images/capenhurst.jpg" target="_blank">more modern one</a>. Both are huge, but very efficient in terms of uranium enrichment.</p>
<p>If you're a clandestine nuclear power, you don't go in that direction. It's way too obvious and it's also pretty hard to pull off (the technology is difficult to get working and still highly classified). What you do is use a technology that was developed a bit later: the gas centrifuge. </p>
<p>Zippe-style gas centrifuges are not (usually) as efficient as gaseous diffusion. You still need a lot of them and their electricity profile is large. But they are physically much smaller and you can hide them in rather generic looking warehouses and even underground. And you don't have to commit to building them all at once — they can be built one-by-one. You still need a lot of them (e.g., a thousand or so) to start really enriching uranium in useful amounts for a weapon. But once you know how to build one, you can build another, and so on, until you have a lot of them. And the facilities are much lower profile. <a href="https://cdn2.img.sputniknews.com/images/104501/86/1045018658.jpg" target="_blank">Here's a Russian enrichment plant</a>, here's <a href="https://d1o9e4un86hhpc.cloudfront.net/images/tinymce/James%201/AE2550.png" target="_blank">an early centrifuge cascade in Iran</a>, and <a href="https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/dangerroom/2010/11/yongbyon_blue_roof_copy_thumb.jpg" target="_blank">here's the centrifuge building in North Korea that we didn't really know existed until they showed it to us, because it looks like a totally normal industrial building from the air</a>. Again, you still need a <em>lot</em> to build a weapon, and it's still not super easy to pull off, but it's a lot easier to hide facilities like this, and much harder to tell what is going on.</p>
<p>The one other thing I'd note is that uranium enrichment requires very large amounts of uranium gas as uranium hexafluoride. This has literally no other use beyond enriching uranium, basically. So if you can track how a country moves uranium around, where it is producing this gas, where it moves that gas, etc., you're bound to see their enrichment activities. How hard is this? If you have no access to a country whatsoever (like North Korea), then very hard. If you do have access, through IAEA inspections or just spies, then the odds of these activities being spotted goes up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
