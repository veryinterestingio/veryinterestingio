		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A large percentage of your skin is made up of a protein called keratin.</p>
<p>Keratin forms long chains and if you were to look at your skin under a really powerful microscope what you would see is a bunch of keratin chains crisscrossing together like a chain link fence.  But just like a chain link fence, those crisscrossing chains leave large holes between themselves that water, or anything else, could go through.</p>
<p>To stop water from passing through those holes, keratin absorbs a small amount of fat from your skin's oil.  That fat sits in those gaps in the keratin chain link fence, preventing water from getting through.</p>
<p>Because keratin absorbs fat from your skin oil like that, anything that is able to dissolve into that fat is able to use it to leapfrog past the keratin in your skin and be absorbed into your body.  There aren't a huge amount of substances like that but that's why very oily substances, like poison oak/ivy, are able to get absorbed into  your skin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If anyone sees this, and is smarter than me, is it possible to get some bit of hydration by sitting in some water?</p>
<p>I ask because this place I used to go camping has a beautiful quarry with the cleanest freshest natural spring water you've ever seen.</p>
<p>The best hangover cure while out there, was to get in one of the shallow ends of the quarry and just hang out in the water. Find a nice spot to sit/float where you're submerged up to the chest and relax for a half hour or an hour. Bam. Hangover gone.</p>
<p>Maybe it was just relaxing, or the water cooled off the body and relieved symptoms that way. I always thought my body was absorbing the water. Apparently it doesn't do that. So it's still a mystery why this magic quarry cured even the worst of hang overs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the main jobs of your skin is to keep all your water inside instead of evaporating away, and things that are good at keeping water in are also good at keeping it out.  Skin oil is one of the major barriers to keeping water out, because water and oil repel each other.</p>
<p>The poisons that can get through the skin are usually oil-soluble and are the kind of threats our ancestors generally didn't run into often enough to need to evolve protections against.  Even if they had, the selection pressure for &quot;don't lose water&quot; is stronger than &quot;don't let oil through.&quot;</p>
<p>In contrast, animals that can absorb water through the skin usually live in environments where water is very readily available and water loss is rarely a concern.  Water-dwelling amphibian skins don't act as much of a barrier for chemicals, pretty much only acting a barrier against infectious agents and other large particles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
