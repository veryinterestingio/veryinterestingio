		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, sort of.<br />
Electricity takes the path of least resistance, from the (rooftop PV) inverter into the service panel, where it will first (try) to power any loads inside the house itself (replacing 'utility' power).    </p>
<p>If there is not enough demand in the house then it will leave the premises and (try to) power the neighbour's house, etc, until eventually it will reach a neighbourhood substation and (tries to) power the next street.      </p>
<p>The 'electrical' load on the transmission(+distribution) will be lower, but because rooftop PV is not 'dispatchable' (doesn't have a throttle and is subject to clouds) the operators in the grid control room have to work harder to 'balance' the grid at large.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Potentially power factor correction can be a huge deal.
Power factor correction is needed when voltage and current are out of phase on an AC grid.
This means you are not transforming the power from the grid 100% efficiently into something useful (heat if you are boiling water, light if you have a lamp on).</p>
<p>To try to correct for this inefficiency (which can be caused by a many different things) you either need to use more copper in you wires or put big capacitors in your grid, or both.
You may have seen systems like this:

<p>Generally speaking, the closer your source is the lower the transmission costs of power. You can get good efficiency over long distances, but it requires some pretty expensive equipment.</p>
<p>Distributed supplies, such as wind turbines, grid storage batteries and solar cells can help with these issues.</p>
<p>Long story short: You can spare a lot of expensive equipment if your have a source of electricity close to where it is consumed, which also lowers the transmission inefficiency.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's two ways to interpret the &quot;transmission demand&quot; in your question. </p>
<p>Firstly, the amount of power flowing in transmission lines at any one time. Solar's normally going to reduce this as explained by lots of others.</p>
<p>The other interpretation is what effect it has on the requirement for transmission lines. This is almost entirely determined by peak demand load. The grid needs to have enough capacity to meet the highest instantaneous load. Solar can reduce this if you're somewhere where peak load is due to air conditioning. But not a huge amount (look up duck curve). In places where peak occurs on a cold winter evening solar does absolutely nothing for this. </p>
<p>The second effect is much more important because building more power lines is expensive! The first effect will just reduces losses a bit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In theory yes in practice nope, mainly due to the amount of solar required to make a meaningful impact and the variability of DG. Unless you have distributed generation/ solar available at times of peak demand, peak load on the transmission grid remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Lines are designed around catering for peak loads.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Longer term, distributed generation will absolutely reduce both transmission and distribution infrastructure demand. In rural Australia for example there are numerous instances where relative handfuls of customers are supplied by several hundred if not 1000km+ lengths of distribution conductor lines. With improved pv and storage tech and associated cost it will produce stand alone power systems where the now inefficient (primarily from a maintenance perspective) distribution lines are decommissioned in favour of localised (and isolated from ‘the grid’ as we know it today) distributed generation. Several live trials of this are underway right now across Australia. Ultimately distribution networks will still play a role in supply distribution to sustain peak load and also to facilitate peer to peer trading, which itself is likely to be enabled through blockchain technology removing the need for retailers. Battery and PV are causing a global transformation of the electricity but it will take another decade or so for these new operating modes to proliferate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
