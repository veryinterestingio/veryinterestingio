		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to live science:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A century and a half of scientific inquiry has yet to determine why ice can make you fall down. Scientists agree that a thin layer of liquid water on top of solid ice causes its slipperiness, and that a fluid's mobility makes it difficult to walk on, even if the layer is thin. But there's no consensus as to why ice, unlike most other solids, has such a layer.  </p>
<p>Theorists have speculated that it may be the very act of slipping making contact with the ice that melts its surface. Others think the fluid layer is there before the slipper ever arrived, and is somehow generated by the inherent motion of surface molecules.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's an amazing interview with Rihard Feyman (famous for his work on the Manhattan Project and also explaining to NASA why the Space Shuttle challenger blew up after they were warned it was going to to blow up  when he dipped an O-ring into a glass of ice-water on tv and showed them how it doesn't work when it's cold)</p>
<p>where he responds about how this an impossible question to answer, it starts with a question about magnets  and ends up talking about why ice is slippery and by the end he's  explaining quantum phyisics and the entire universe in laymens terms to the interviewer to make a point about how it's a loaded question  lol </p>
<p>(no offense. that was just his way of answering, because that's just how his mind worked. and he was fucking brilliant)</p>
<p>This man was  a fucking legend. (also hilarious). I highly recommend watching it for the best and most interesting answer this this question and a wide range of other stuff that you'd most likely find interesting if you are wondering this question)

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On the microscopic level, most things that look smooth to our eye really aren't. Our skin is a great example. It looks like like a mess of tall mountains and deep valleys if you zoom in enough. Ice, however, looks fairly smooth when zoomed in. When something rubs across our skin it rubs against those mountains and valleys and slows down (friction). Ice looks more like rolling hills so when something slides across it it isn't trapped by mountains and valleys so it doesn't flow nearly as much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Googling that question I got the following : </p>
<p>Ice has a very <a href="http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/hexagonal_ice.html" target="_blank">regular, neat crystal structure</a>, where each water molecule in the crystal is attached to three others. The molecules on the surface can only be attached to two others (being on the surface) so because of this weak bond these surface molecules tumble, and attach and detach themselves to various sites on the crystal as they move.</p>
<p>Ice is slippery because of loose water molecules. It's not a film of water, they don't cover the whole surface. So it's like a floor that is covered with marbles. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
