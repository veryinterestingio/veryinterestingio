		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A 4-stroke engine has a different function for each &quot;stroke&quot; (up or down movement of the piston) - 1. (down) as the piston moves down, air and fuel comes into the cylinder. 2. (up) the air/fuel mixture is compressed. 3. (down) the spark plug ignites the mixture creating power by pushing the piston down.  4. (up) the combusted gas is exhausted.  Then repeat to stroke #1.  </p>
<p>A 2-stroke engine (common in small engines, motorcycles, lawn mowers, etc) combines the intake, exhaust, and ignition/power all on the down stroke. The air/fuel mixture is then compressed for ignition on the next down stroke.  </p>
<p>There's a lot of differences in how the air and fuel is added to and gasses exhausted from the cylinder. But what the engine does for each stroke is the root difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two-stroke means each piston goes down once and up once. Four-stroke is down, up, down, up because the strokes where it draws in air and pushes out exhaust are separate from the strokes where it is getting and burning fuel. </p>
<p>Two-strokes get roughly twice the power for the same engine size because only the strokes where fuel is detonated add power and two-stroke get fuel twice as often as four-stroke. Four-strokes pollute less, though.</p>
<p>Two-stroke are also a simpler design because they don't need valves to control airflow which is less to break and means less weight. The trade-off is the need to mix oil in the gasoline which also increases pollution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Four stroke engine: suck squeeze bang blow.  Starting with the piston at the top of the cylinder, it goes down with the intake port open, and sucks in the air/fuel mixture. Then the port closes and the piston goes up, compression the mixture.  At the top, the spark fires and makes the fuel burn.  The piston goes down again and the hot/high pressure fuel makes power.  Then the exhaust port opens, and the piston goes up pushing the fuel out.  This means you get one complete set of operations for every 2 revolutions of the crankshaft.</p>
<p>In a two stroke engine, when the piston is at the bottom, the inlet and exhaust ports open together and the incoming air/fuel mixture pushes the exhaust from the last cycle out of the space, then the piston goes up to compress the mixture, the spark plug makes the fuel burn and the piston comes down to get the power out.  This means you get one complete set of operations every 1 revolution of the crankshaft.</p>
<p>Because in a two stroke both inlet and exhaust are happening together, you get the problems that you might not push all of the exhaust out, and you might get some of the air/fuel coming in going straight out the exhaust and not being used for powering the engine.</p>
<p>Four stroke engines are more efficient and because of the better control of where the gases go, you don't get so much wasted fuel going straight out the exhaust.  Two stroke engines get twice the number of power strokes per revolution, so are smaller and lighter weight for a given power output.  Fuel going out the exhaust is not only wasteful, but it can also lead to serious pollution problems producing photochemical smog.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
