		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The comments have been describing the one way dynamic of how they know which point they are aiming for (training by humans) , I don't know if how they actually navigate has been answered. Birds have recently been found to have both a 'map sense' and a 'compass sense'.</p>
<p>There is a nerve, the trigeminal nerve, in the beak which, when cut, kills their compass sense. But their map sense won't be affected. If you cut the nerve and release, they will be able to find their way. However if you cut the nerve and then move them from the that place, say a 1000km North as was done in the original experiment, they won't know they have been moved and will attempt to fly the same route as they would have from the place when the nerve was cut, ultimately getting completely lost.</p>
<p>There have also been large concentrations of iron found in the avian inner ear, and some evidence birds can 'see' magnetic fields due to chemical reactions in their eyes. What they see had been explained to me before to be possiblely like seeing very faint aurora. This would be linked more to the map sense.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it's likely a couple of different physiological mechanisms working in tandem, much like a shark uses scent, hearing and bioekectricity to locate prey. But we are fairly certain it's very much magnetically based and with processes happening in the beak (receptors in the nasal cavity I think), eyes and inner ear. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Homing pigeons go home. So you will take them with you to wherever you are going. And when you need to send a message back home, you whip one out, tie a message to it and let it go. It will then fly HOME. They aren't used for sending messages to random far flung locations. They only go home.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The pigeons used to carry messages are called homing pigeons. These pigeons are particularly good at remembering where they live, and finding their way even when they’ve been transported tremendous distances away from it. If you want to be really sure your messages will get through, you’ll give the pigeons a few trial runs first, to make sure they know the way.</p>
<p>You take the pigeons from their home, put them into cages, and transport them to your location. When you want to send a message, you strap it in a special lightweight case to the pigeon’s leg, and you let the pigeon go.</p>
<p>It simply flies home, that’s all.</p>
<p>Pigeons don’t fly anywhere else — only home.</p>
<p>The advantage to a pigeon-borne message is that it’s unlikely to be intercepted, and the pigeon will head for home very fast — faster than a car could ever get there.</p>
<p>The disadvantage is that pigeons <em>can</em> sometimes become lost, and they’re certainly prone to being picked off by predators. So, often, messages would be repeated with multiple birds, so that at least one pigeon would make it home.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
