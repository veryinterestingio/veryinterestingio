		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans laugh because we are very very social animals.</p>
<p>And before language was developed, humans and our ancestors still needed ways to “communicate” socially. Besides your grunts, roars, shouts, fights, and social hierarchies, laughing was another way of non verbal communication.</p>
<p>Laughter naturally builds bonds between two individuals laughing at the same time, so it helped up build deeper social bonds with one another. Laughter is also a way to acknowledge and diffuse awkward/embarrassings/Tense situations. Laughter is a way to basically go “hey man I know you might be angry or irritated but ah it’s fine just laugh about it”</p>
<p>So laughter helps keep those social bonds form breaking down soon.</p>
<p>And yes, other great Apes laugh too, tho many are silent laughter. But gorillas, chimpanzees, orangutans all laugh in similar ways to us</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What other animals vocalize may or may not be recognized as laughter to us. Sometimes it just won't translate. Sometimes it's too difficult for a humans to hear <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/video/eavesdrop-on-ultrasonic-rat-giggles/" target="_blank">Here's something on rat giggles</a> scientists will tickle rats to get them to giggle but you have to have auditory equipment that can allow us to hear ultrasonic sounds.</p>
<p>Other sounds in the animal kingdom that sound like laughter are not actually laughter or we just hear them as laughter from our perspective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading once about a scientist who wanted to find out if laughter/smiling was a natural human reaction or if it was somehow learned. To find out he forbid his wife from laughing/smiling at their newborn just to prove his theory. I dont remember what the conclusion was but either way thats some pretty shitty parenting. </p>
<p>I tried looking for it on the internet but I just can't find it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
