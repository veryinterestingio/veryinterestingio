		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Combination vocal folds (and all the related structures), core strength, and vocal habits.</p>
<p>Sneezing and laughing both require involuntary, forced exhalation. You exhale forcefully by squeezing your ribcage and ab muscles. The stronger your abs, the harsher the sneeze. </p>
<p>Now that you're exhaling, air passes over your vocal folds. When you aren't making vocal noises, your vocal folds kinda sit wide open. When you're talking, your vocal folds close up and air passing between them causes them to vibrate (kind of like letting air out of a balloon. If the mouth of the balloon is left wide, it doesn't make as much noise. But if you stretch out the mouth, it makes that squeaking noise. Your vocal cords are the mouth of the balloon and the squeaking noise is your voice). I personally sound like I'm shouting when I sneeze, so my vocal tract spasms as well as my core muscles. Other people have super quiet sneezes, so their vocal tract doesn't spasm when they sneeze. Yours may spasm sometimes, all the time, or none of the time. A person's sneezes, like their voice, are determined by the condition of their vocal tract. </p>
<p>When it comes to laughing, generally speaking, you're still involuntarily exhaling, but it's a series of weaker spasms rather than one strong spasm. Since the spasms are weaker, you can have more control over what your laugh sounds like than your sneezes. Most people don't consciously try to change their laugh so their vocal habits tend to control how they sound. I personally had a really harsh laugh until I started learning to sing, which involved learning to habitually relax my vocal tract. Now my laugh is much nicer. </p>
<p>Another thing that affects the sound of your laugh is how <em>other</em> people laugh. Generally speaking, when you spend lots of time with someone you like, you tend to copy them. Spend enough time laughing with them and you might develop vocal habits that sound like theirs. Bonus fact: my laugh started sounding harsh after dating a girl who had a really terrible laugh. Thank god for singing lessons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sneeze and laugh are separate. Sneeze comes from the diaphragm to keep the heart in check. Laughter, much like voice is generated in the mind first, vs a sneeze physical first. The change of pitch is designed as a defense mechanism in both directions. It's suggested a loud sneeze and a more boisterous laugh are both embellished to protect the host during times of attack. To best answer you: free will is dead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
