		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apparently Chimpanzee fossils are much rarer, because they usually lived in the Congo jungle where conditions aren’t as conducive to fossilization as the Rift Valley.  (Humans look like they evolved in the Rift Valley because that’s where most of our ancient fossils have been found, but that may just tell us they fossilized there best.)  The first fossil Chimpanzee teeth from after the split with humans weren’t found until 2005!  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.livescience.com/9326-chimp-fossils.html" target="_blank">https://www.livescience.com/9326-chimp-fossils.html</a></p>
<p>We do have a lot of interesting insights from their DNA, which has been evolving in a different direction from our common ancestors.  And we have two closely related (sub) species of Chimpanzee to contrast, so we can compare the common Chimpanzee to Bonobos.  They split because the Congo river formed and grew, becoming effectively impassible to apes until we started building boats.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to the comment above : Yes, we have almost no fossils from species who lived in forests since the beginning, even though forests are the places where there is the most diversity of species. So most species of animal who ever lived on earth will never be found and are lost for ever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our MRCA was likely more arboreal than either human or chimp, and likely didn't knuckle-walk (knuckle-walking in chimps and gorillas is mecanically different and seems to be parallel evolution, as it is an advantageous way of going from a quadrupedal gait to a vertical climb while minimizing spine stress; meanwhile, orangutans fist-walk when grounded).</p>
<p>Remember, hominoid evolution has brachiation and the development of an orthograde posture first, and ground adaptions in Homininae later (with our lineage being the only one to keep the brachiation-focused orthograde posture for ground dwelling; it is good for running, reduced solar exposure and far seeing; stuff the forest-dwelling gorilla and chimp lineages weren't pressured for).</p>
<p>The Plio-Pleistocene forest recession probably had something to do, we Hominines aren't the only African primates to develop large, ground dwelling lineages separately; mangabeys evolved large terrestrial forms independently 3 times: mandrills, baboons and geladas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anthropologist and archeologist here. We are not split from a chimpanzee. We both share a common ancestor in the distant past.  We are hybrids of homo sapiens, neanderthal, and denisovan. Chimps stayed relatively localized and in a relatively small area compared to the above mentioned species who traveled vast distances. We didn't split from chimps, we both split from something much older, maybe habalis or some of the &quot;hobbit&quot; hominoids. I do mostly Florida archeology so I only work with sapiens but your question makes incorrect assumptions. It is a complicated but we'll documented lineage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
