		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's absolutely possible for a fighter craft to know it's been locked onto.</p>
<p>In order to home in on something, you have to know where it is, and one way to know where things are is to use <em>radar</em> -- that is, send out a beam of radio waves that bounces off of objects and comes back to the transmitter, painting a picture of what's around it. A radar system has to scan the entire sky, so the number of times the radar track hits a target aircraft in a minute is relatively low.</p>
<p>When a radar system sees something it wants, it turns on a different radar that scans much more quickly to provide more accurate tracking data to the missile. Aircraft can determine how quickly they're being painted by radar; if they're being painted very rapidly, that probably means a radar-tracking missile has acquired them.</p>
<p>There are other types of missile guidance that are harder to detect; heat-seeking missiles, for example, don't rely on signals bounced off the target, so an aircraft can't know one's on its tail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of radar like a flashlight in a Dark room. You can see what the flashlight beam is on, but the flash light can be seen from a long ways off. When the radar warnings detect radar that is of a certain type, the pilot can be alerted. The bandwidth of energy of a radar emitter have a specific fingerprint making them pretty easy to identify.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll add some more to what others have said.</p>
<p>Modern fighter jets (3rd gen and onwards) are equipped with an RWR systems (radar warning receivers), which are essentially a set of antennas mounted around the aircraft. Those antennas pick up radar signals, identify them and display them to a pilot on a screen in the cockpit. RWR system not only has a capability to detect a lock, but it also picks up all types of radar signals, so it can also be used to locate  a radar source which isn't locking you.</p>
<p>NATO use a code &quot;nails&quot; to describe a regular radar signal and &quot;spike&quot; to call out a lock. It's important to remember that the only difference between a lock and a normal signal is focus and intensity, so the RWR can easily recognize between the two.</p>
<p>Now, the more complicated bit is that modern fighter jets are equipped with a system called TWS (track while scan), which allows to lock an aircraft without &quot;spiking&quot; it. So a locked plane will still receive a &quot;nails&quot; signal but won't recognize it as a lock. On top of that, Fox 3 missiles (common nowadays) are equipped with their own radar, and don't rely on a donated lock to track their target, therefore it's entirely possible and common to fire a long range missile without actually locking the target. Such target would only receive a lock warning once the missiles radar activates, which leaves little time for reaction.</p>
<p>All of that above refers to radar guided missiles.
Heatseaking missiles (much shorter range) do not send radar signals and are therefore harder to detect, though if you're close enough to be on a receiving end of one, you propably have visual on the enemy and you're able to visually identify a launch. Some aircraft (e.g A-10, C-130) are equipped with heatseeker detection systems but they're relatively rare.</p>
<p>If you have any more questions about modern (or vintage) air combat, fire away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Radar can be detected.  It's basically radio waves, we've been able to triangulate the position of radio emitters for decades.</p>
<p>The British found that out the hard way in the Falkands War.  They went down there with active radar on nearly everything they had but the Argentines had an American-made AWACS (Airborn Warning and Control System) that could detect active radar from twice the distance that radar itself could detect things.  </p>
<p>This is why the Argentine airforce despite being outnubered and outdated could inflict so much damage on the British naval forces.  the Argentines were literally hunting for sources of radio transmission and the British had them equipped on everything they brought</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
