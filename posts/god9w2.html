		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: You don't.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Long Answer: This is a type of confirmation bias that exists in humans.  We tend to only remember the positive cases and forget the negative ones.  Therefore it feels like we have this ability, but in actuality we do not.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There are four sets instances that we have to think about to see that if someone is staring at us, can we actually detect it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>The instances where someone is staring at you and you &quot;detect it&quot; and confirm that you were being stared at.
<ul>
<li>These are the cases you remember.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The instances where someone is staring at you and you didn't notice.
<ul>
<li>These are the cases that you would never know about.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The instances where no one is staring at you and you get the feeling that someone is staring at you.
<ul>
<li>These are the cases you forget because nothing really important happened.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The instances where no one is staring at you and you don't get the feeling. 
<ul>
<li>And this is basically most of the time and really unimportant for you to remember.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As you can see your brain will only really remember one of these scenarios and ignore the rest of the data.  This leads us to the incorrect conclusion that we have the ability to detect when someone is staring at us, as we only really have one quarter of all the available data.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can detect the presence of another person if they change the environment. Even without seeing them. </p>
<p>I have a coworker that like to sneak up on people as a practical joke. My peripheral vision can be nowhere near him, but I might subconciously notice a change in the noise that the radio makes because he is blocking sound by standing in the doorway. </p>
<p>Your brain picks up all kinds of things you dont actively notice. But if someone just cut a hole in the wall of your room and stared at you, you wouldn't notice. Trust me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because of the totally mind-blowing way our brains work.</p>
<p>Basically, we're constantly inundated with sensory information and most of that information is unimportant and distracting. Like right now, you're probably not all that aware of your breathing, or the feel of your tongue in your mouth or the sound of the traffic passing by outside... but the second I draw attention to it, you instantly become aware of those things.</p>
<p>So, what happens is that while you are constantly unconsciously monitoring everything around you, your brain filters out the unimportant stuff and only brings the important stuff to your conscious attention. It's why you can be in a crowded room where the conversation just sounds like a dull roar, but the second someone on the other side of the room says your name, you instantly hear it... You're basically hearing <em>all</em> the conversations at once, but because that would be too much to consciously process and keep track of without going totally insane, your brain is filtering most of it out until something important comes up.</p>
<p>So, really you're not 'feeling' that someone is staring at you, you've just picked up on their presence unconsciously. You may have seen them out of the corner of your eye, heard them or noticed something else that's alerted you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
