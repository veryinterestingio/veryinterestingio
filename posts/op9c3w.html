		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of it is plain cultural. People for a long time didn't wash clothes/bedclothes way as often as we do now and it was perfectly normal. Some is that we consider body odor as signal for &quot;dirty&quot; now. It's what you're modeled and taught from an early age more than the instinctual reactions to feces and vomit which most people share.</p>
<p>But washing brings the fibers in cloth back to their original shape, too. The texture changes noticeably. More obviously so with wool than cotton, but getting wet and drying again has an effect with all of them. Use stretches fibers out of shape.<br />
Add to that whatever other treatment the cloth gets, scent from the detergent, maybe fabric softener which makes fibers more slippery (and less absorbent and kinda slimy, not a fan), or in the opposite direction: starch. Hotel bedclothes are commonly starched for that extra &quot;crispness&quot;. But it can't be too stiff and definitely not in patches, that suggests something spilled and dried there. </p>
<p>Which of those sensations you associate with clean varies a bit. It doesn't mean things are actually clean, as long as they smell and feel right they could still be filthy and people wouldn't notice. Or a patch of spilled glue, not &quot;bad dirt&quot; but still feels suspiciously like something gross. A visible stain can be clean, the fibers are just dyed and everything else is washed out, but it still looks suspicious.<br />
Personally sheets from the dryer feel less &quot;clean&quot; than line-dried, again, crispier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
