		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your gut bacteria is used to only consuming certain things, and the more you eat of a certain thing, the better your gut bacteria gets at breaking that stuff down. When you suddenly switch fro, say, Italian cuisine to something as wildly different as Szechuan or Indian cuisine, then suddenly your gut bacteria isn't able to digest it as efficiently, and you get the rumbles as a result.</p>
<p>Deeper explanation: the collective environment of your stomach and intestines(microbiome) is full of many hundreds, if not thousands, of kinds of bacteria. Together, they are capable of digesting nearly any digestible material. When you stick to a certain kind of food, say lots of processed starches and red meat and soda, for example, the bacteria that are good at digesting those things flourish, and you can easily process those foods. There is evidence to suggest you also begin a feedback loop where your gut bacteria affects your brain chemistry, and drives you to crave those types of food more often as well. When you suddenly consume something that is substantially different from your normal, like Indian or Szechuan cuisine, because of all the spices and new flavors and compounds present in that food, your normal gut flora that can digest the red meat and processed foods have no idea what to do. The small amount of bacteria that, until then, has just been hanging out but not efficiently digesting anything, suddenly has the stuff it needs and does it's best, but naturally since there's only a very small amount that can effectively digest the spices and compounds, more of it gets by, and winds up as the burning feeling you get when sitting on the toilet.</p>
<p>People who experience a regular, wide variety of foods and spices have a much more naturally robust microbiome, and are less prone to those stomach issues than someone with a simple, constant diet. In my opinion(because I love to cook), people ought to try and regularly eat lots of different regional foods from around the world. I personally get a lot of satisfaction from both cooking and eating lots of different foods, so the health benefits are secondary for me.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's specifically because of the infrequency of ingestion that you get more bubble guts from eating certain things.  If your body isn't used to encountering such food, your body is gonna have a more difficult time digesting it, usually because you don't have the necessary amount of gut <del>fauna</del> flora and/or you don't produce enough of the necessary enzymes for digestion since you didn't really have to in the first place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It could also be related to the amount if fiber. South East Asian cultures typically eat 4-5 times more fiber than Western diets, and if you are not used to consuming a large amount of fiber, it can make your stomach grumble. </p>
<p>But if you are talking about blowing up the toilet after a plate of tikka masala extra hot, it might be the extra hot I donâ€™t know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unfamiliar spices cause your digestive system to view it as potentially harmful and want you to expel it asap.</p>
<p>This can be caused by allergies, gut bacteria being unable to process this unfamiliar spice, or just it being an irritant in general (capsaicin for example)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heavy use of onions, beans or vegetables in the cabbage family. All of these are high in fructans, which are indigestable fiber formed from fructose. We lack the enzymes to digest all of these into sugars, but the bacteria in our gut does not, they ferment these sugars, and produce gas and irritation as a result.</p>
<p>Similarly, milk products like cheese contain concentrated lactose, which is only partially digestible by most adults and has the same effect.</p>
<p>These types of foods are often referred to in dietary research as FODMAPS.  (fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols)</p>
<p>There is lots of information available via google.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
