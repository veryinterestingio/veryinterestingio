		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The compass detects magnetism, but it drifts. There is always changing local magnetism, like magnets in a phone case, or just innacuracies in the magnetometer that build up.</p>
<p>But the phone has many other sensors - most important is acceleration sensors that detect movement and gravity, and gyroscopes that detect direction. The phone can detect errors in the magnetometer (compass) by comparing them.</p>
<p>As you move your phone around, it can detect, using those gyros and accelerometers, how it is moving in space. As any innacuracy in the phone's magnet sensor will stay the same as you move it, it can detect what magnetism remains static and what changes. It can subtract the stationary magnetics and be left the changing ones - and the magnetism that changes as you move the phone around is going to be the Earth's.</p>
<p>In addition, as the phone moves right around, it knows that the magnetic fields should also, turning right around in lockstep with the rotation it is measuring from the gyro. If the phone is close to a big piece of steel, that will show up as an attraction of both the north and south poles, out of step with the rotation. The software can detect and correct for this, too.</p>
<p>Moving the phone in that figure-8^* pattern is used to get it started. Once you are using the compass and moving around, the phone keeps correcting.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other parts of the phone produce their own magnetic field, which biases the compasses. If you move the phone around you can tell which part of the field moves around with the phone -  the field produced by the phone itself.  Once you know that, you can compensate for it to obtain the earthâ€™s magnetic field.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
