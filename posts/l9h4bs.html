		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I thought for sure someone would give you the answer. But I saw lots of just dead wrong answers, like a cable doesn't have higher strength than a rod, that it's more flexible, or that it's denser. But tensile strength, which is the same thing as ultimate tensile strength for a wire, is fracture load divided by true area. The question asked why the wire has a higher strength than a rod. The poster didn't mention alloys, so let's assume the rod and the wire are of the same material. (This is not necessarily true, as a wire may very well have higher carbon content and that could be an additional answer. Steel is a material class, there are many kinds of steel commercially available.)</p>
<p>The answer is that wire is cold drawn to a much higher extent than a larger diameter rod. Steel is like most metals, in that there is a marked increase in strength when you deform it. Drawing increases the wire's strength, and also reduces its ductility (measured by strain to failure). Materials scientists will explain this by noting that the microstructure of a cold drawn material has smaller and more elongated grains, and therefore dislocations in the metal crystals have a harder time moving, interfere with each other, and get pinned at grain boundaries very quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When considering strength you have to consider what is a &quot;failure&quot;. In real life no material is perfect and so a failure usually starts at a weak point due to inconsistent manufacture (this could be almost anything: size, temperature during manufacture, foreign materials introduced...).</p>
<p>Even if we assume heat treating and cold drawing the steel to make the rod or the wire is the same, any discontinuity in the rod will cause a micro failure and the forces will have to be carried by the steel around it as you load it to failure. In the case of a rod, once you pass the elastic range, the rod will deform plasticly and actually get thinner as it &quot;stretches&quot; increasing the force per area (stress) and thus causing more of the steel to reach the plastic zone and so the whole thing fails.</p>
<p>In a cable, a discontinuity in one strand can allow that strand to fail and then evenly distribute this extra force to all other strands. Friction in the winding will also allow the broken strand to still carry some load.</p>
<p>In a perfect ideal rod or cable with steel made from the same material manufactured the same way, the resultant strength would be the same. In any real world manufacturing, a cable would take more load before failing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
