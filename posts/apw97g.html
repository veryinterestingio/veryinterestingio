		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to these studies: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2818549/" target="_blank">Sex Differences in the Adolescent Brain</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4539869/" target="_blank">Women and Schizophrenia </a>, the female brain finishes maturing on average four years earlier than males (21 in women and 25 in men).
However, the onset of schizophrenia occurs later in women (late 20s+ in women and 18-24 in men).</p>
<p>The first study referenced mentions a hypothesis that the pubertal surge in estrogen women experience may delay the symptoms, but the researchers seemed hesitant to attribute that as a definite cause. </p>
<p>I have not been able to find an answer as to why schizophrenia typically begins later in women, especially since the observed development patterns between the sexes would intuit the opposite.</p>
<p>Does anyone know the answer to this?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a researcher who was able to link development of schizophrenia in women post-partum and at menopause, suggesting that the hormone fluctuation (estrogen) may cause the later onset in those susceptible. If this is an average, the women diagnosed later in life may be throwing off that value. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason the authors of the study were hesitant is that the reason for this phenomenon is unknown. It probably will stay unknown as long as the cause for schizophrenia is not entirely clear. If you find it make sure to tell me so I can jump onto the Nature paper were publishing.</p>
<p>By the way those age ranges are only where most cases of schizophrenia break out. It can start your whole life though</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It could be more social than biologic reasons causing this discrepancy. Since total prevalence of schizophrenia is equal between men and women. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's been a while since I've read about this, but I believe there are studies showing estrogen has an anti-dopaminergic effect, so the hypothesis was that females have a degree of protection from the positive symptoms of psychosis. Traditional antipsychotic medications work by their D2 blocking (dopamine antagonism) effect. The model is that estrogen doesn't prevent the disease from eventually manifesting for women, but can help delay the onset. Women with schizophrenia also tend to have somewhat better functioning than men, which may be from the later onset – on average women have more time to develop social supports and education/career skills before the psychosis presents.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
