		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, not all vaccines are recommended after infection. This is something that varies according to each pathogen and the evidence base behind vaccination. </p>
<p>I'm sure there are more counterexamples, but two that come to mind are:</p>
<ul>
<li>We sometimes make decisions about hepatitis B vaccination based on antibody testing; if a person has antibodies reflecting prior infection, we don't vaccinate</li>
<li>The HPV vaccine is only thought to provide benefit <em>before</em> a person is exposed to HPV. While we don't routinely test people for HPV just to make vaccination decisions (though we do as part of a Pap smear), the reason why universal vaccination stops at age 26 (in the U.S. anyway) is that we expect most adults will have been exposed to HPV by this age</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised nobody has mentioned the dengue vaccine yet.  Dengue fever is one of the rare instances of antibody-dependent enhancement where the first time you catch it is pretty mild, but if you get any of the other four variants it can be quite deadly.  The vaccine therefore is only recommended if you've already had it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hard no.</p>
<p>For Q Fever vaccination, I had to have a blood antibody test come back negative, and an initial &quot;micro vaccination&quot; to measure a reaction in the event antibodies were present and not detected. When they came back fine, I still needed to hang at the medical centre for 30 minutes for any reaction.</p>
<p>So previously having had Q Fever and then getting the vaccine was going to be baaad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
