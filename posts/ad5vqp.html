		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is called a &quot;monitor mix&quot; and it can be whatever the performer wants. If they are singing it will almost always include their own vocals. If they are playing an instrument it will almost always include that instrument. Many performers will want to hear some of all the other instruments. When there is a drummer they will likely want some of the kick drum and the snare drum and maybe some hi-hat but usually not much else.   </p>
<p>Again this is 100% up to the wishes of the performer. Sometimes there will be a click track to help keep them in sync with any pre-recorded playback. Sometimes there will be verbal instructions telling them which song is about to be played back or reminding them of solos or bridges coming up in the song.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two ‘mixes’ going on for concerts, front of house (what the audience hears) and monitor (what artist hears) (this is a bit oversimplified, bc there can be multiple monitor mixes, but it’s easier to explain with just one).</p>
<p>The artist may like or need a different balance than the main mix.  In this case, they would need the instruments (vocal + keyboard) as well as click/track if they’re using tracks and perhaps certain effects that aren’t there acoustically such as reverbs and echoes/delay</p>
<p>In the case of multiple members of the same band, each probably wants vastly different things in their ears — I work with a corporate/wedding band, and we can have up to 12 different monitor mixes.  Each musician tends to like to have a lot of themselves in order to monitor themselves and stay on time/pitch, and then maybe the bassist wants more kick than everyone else t really lock in on the groove, or the drummer just needs a lot of click and track and doesn’t really need to hear the acoustic guitar and keys - the mixes fully depend on the musician in question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Musicians performing live generally find some sort of monitor useful. It can be either a speaker pointed back at the band or an earpiece or headphone. </p>
<p>Without a monitor, the sound system is mostly pointed out towards the audience and it is difficult to hear your own instrument or those of others. Singing is also difficult when you can't hear your own voice over the din. </p>
<p>Or sometimes you want a different mix of sound than what the audience is hearing. More or less of your own voice or a particular instrument. The sound person can mix the monitor sound separately from the house PA.</p>
<p>Not sure what they're hearing in your example. Another possibility is a click track playing through the headphones, to keep time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For rythm sections, it may be a metronome (a clicky thingy that ticks in an exact rythm, with a special click to emphasize the first note of a section).</p>
<p>This helps them stay in check through the noise of a possible crowd, other instruments, or slip ups.</p>
<p>I attended a non-acoustic band once, and noticed the drummer had some slip ups, nad I noticed he had these little plugs he was wearing. Afterwards a band member explained that there were problems with the metronome, which caused him to fall out of it for a few beats, before picking it back up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
