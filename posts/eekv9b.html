		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The power comes from the power of the strike. If one employee gets fed up and threatens to walk out, so what? He will be replaced. But, if the entire crew walks out, it shuts down the operation. If all the employees in other operations within the company join in solidarity with their union brothers and also walk off the job, the entire corporation can be brought to a standstill. If the company wants to run its operations, it will have to make an equitable deal with the union and get them to go back to work. Strikes are not to be taken lightly, and there is always pain on both sides, but it is the only power a union has.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People working within an industry or industries decide to make common cause with each other for the purpose of bargaining with their bosses as a collective group as opposed to as a series of disunited individuals. They believe by doing that they will get a better deal than the individuals would on their own.</p>
<p>At its base, that's all there is to it. However much more has been built on those foundations, like the idea of levying a membership fee which can be used to hire professional organisers and lawyers for members who get into trouble, or to fund protest tactics such as strikes. Then you have the whole idea of union recognition where certain companies will agree that certain unions represent their workers and so have certain rights when it comes to consultation and decisionmaking. At its most extreme there's even the &quot;closed shop&quot; model where you have to be a union member to work at the company and the union effectively takes over the day to day running of the company. </p>
<p>Each country has different laws that regulate trade union behaviour and this has a big influence on how they operate. British and American unions are very different for example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is very simplistic, but this is ELI5:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How did they get in power and give us rights?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An employee only really has 1 thing of interest to an employer - their labour. So when a group of people gets together who have all agreed to stop providing that labour to the employer, they have to listen to what the workers want. Strike action has been a huge force in getting governments to put worker protections in place.</p>
<p>While the normal employees are on strike, the employer can bring in outside workers, but if it's skilled work this is difficult to find people with the right skills, in the right area, who are willing to do this. These outside workers will usually also charge a LOT of money because they know the employer needs them.</p>
<p>It's not normally in an employer's interests to let strike action go ahead, which is why unions have quite a lot of power.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a system without unions, companies are often able to use their size and power to take advantage of their workers. Those workers feel powerless and alone and unable to negotiate better conditions.</p>
<p>A union is a way that the workers say that they want to use their numbers to negotiate as one collective unit. This restores some balance to the equation. The workers agree that the union will represent them in negotiations, and they will all accept the terms that the union is able to agree.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
