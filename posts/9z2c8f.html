		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm Dr Melanie Windridge, a plasma physicist who combines science with adventure. In Spring 2018 I climbed Mount Everest and explored the science that helps climbers survive at high altitude and under extreme conditions.</p>
<p>Along the way I spoke to experts and created a video series called &quot;The Science of the Summit&quot;. It's hosted on the Institute of Physics' YouTube channel and covers statistics, fitness and training, risk and motivation, oxygen systems, mountain weather, the chemistry of clothing, communications in remote locations, physiology and medicine, and helicopter rescue.</p>
<p>An improved understanding of high-altitude physiology, acclimatisation and nutrition was instrumental in the British success on Everest in 1953. Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay were the first people ever to stand on the top of Everest. They were supported not only by their expedition climbing team mates but also by the work of physiologist Griffith Pugh and others. Since their successful summit, science, technology and our understanding of physiology at high altitude have further improved.</p>
<p>In 2016 I published &quot;Aurora: In Search of the Northern Lights&quot;. The book is a journey of discovery and explores the visual beauty, legends and science of the northern lights, including the developing threat of space weather. I'm fascinated by the aurora. It's a marvel unlike any other in which the powers of astronomy, geology, magnetism and atomic physics combine to create one of the wonders of the natural world.</p>
<p>My explorations of the aurora have led me to many Arctic destinations such as Sweden, Norway, Canada, Iceland and Svalbard.</p>
<p>I have written a blog about Science at the Extremes for several years. You can have a look and subscribe to it here: <a href="http://melaniewindridge.co.uk/blog_home" target="_blank">http://melaniewindridge.co.uk/blog_home</a></p>
<p>I'm here to talk about science and adventure - my experiences on Everest and in the Arctic with the aurora, and the science and technology that support high-altitude climbers and how they have improved and developed over the years. I'll start around 4pm UT (11am ET). AMA!</p></div></div>
