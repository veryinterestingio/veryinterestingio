		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lot of the initial data we got from China wasn't super helpful. We knew it was contagious, deadly, And had a brief idea of what symptoms looked like.</p>
<p>At first, treatment was shifted towards early intubation (no bipap, no hiflow oxygen) but patients were found to have a difficult time being extubated. Now we tend to delay intubation and try hiflow oxygen (talking 60-100% blend of oxygen at 60-80L of minute, a truly massive amount of oxygen therapy. </p>
<p>Medication therapy has shifted as well. Initially it was thought steroids (traditionally used in ARDS treatment) was harmful in this type of patient, where as now they are given religiously. We also no longer give hydroxychloroquine as the rhythmn issues were found to be more harmful than helpful. We have remdesivir as an antiviral for treatment which has shown an increase in favorable outcomes, albeit this medication can also come with other dangers and certainly isn't a cure all.</p>
<p>Convalescent plasma is also available which has shown some benefit as well, but really isn't truly studied well enough to say how much. </p>
<p>I'm just nurse, so if any physicians or other providers have any corrections or anything I missed,  please feel free to chime in.</p>
<p>Edit: forgot to mention hypercoagulopthy. Its now understood critically ill patients have a significantly increased chance of blood clot formation, significantly increasing risk of stroke, pe/dvt, limb/tissue ischemia. Patients are now started on prophylaxis if not already taking something (like xarelto/eloquis/Coumadin etc.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ICU doc who treats COVID-19 and research on COVID, and published on COVID both original research and editorials in reputable medical journals.</p>
<p>We are much better than previously.</p>
<p>Regarding COVID-19 specific therapies:</p>
<ol>
<li>The UK RECOVERY trial demonstrated a mortality benefit in intubated patients who received dexamethasone. There are some flaws with the study, and the exciting finding may not be methodologically robust, but generally, people are using it.</li>
<li>The NIH ORCHID trial demonstrated no mortality benefit in ICU patients with hydroxychloroquine.</li>
<li>The ACTT-1 trial suggested a shorter recovery time in hospitalized patients with COVID who received remdesivir. This is the least solid data of the three studies I mentioned.</li>
<li>At present, there is no compelling data to suggest convalescent plasma, or any other drug, will benefit patients with COVID. Despite this, many physicians, including my colleagues, still administer it and other unproven therapies. Additionally, there isn't compelling data about use of these therapies as a preventative, or administration in mild disease, although the RECOVERY trial suggested that mild disease night do worse with dexamethasone.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a desire among physicians who are desperate to try any plausible therapy. But these are unproven and may actually be harmful. We don't know. A few years ago, there was a big splash about a possible therapy of vitamin c, thiamine, and steroids for sepsis. The original study was intriguing, but methodologically flawed. Many docs gave the cocktail anyway, thinking it couldn't hurt, and might help. A few years later, several better studies have been done, and a large one is still underway. There is no evidence of benefit, and some evidence to suggest harm. So the docs you see giving convalescent plasma, hydroxychloroquine, and beta agonists are really practicing magical thinking, not science.</p>
<p>The reason the UK was able to conduct so many studies with larger numbers despite having fewer COVID patients than the US is because there was effective scientific leadership to encourage patients to join trials. We struggled to enroll patients in trials in the US because no patient wanted to be randomized-- they wanted to be sure that they would get the magical hydroxychloroquine, and many docs capitulated to these requests, instead of standing firm and saying, &quot;We don't know if it works, which is why we're studying it.&quot;</p>
<p>But the most important benefit to how we treat COVID is better supportive care. Some of this has to do with less resource strain than was present in March, especially in Italy, Spain, New York. Hospitals relied on just-in-time inventory supply chain models and refused to acknowledge problems despite China giving everyone a 2 month head start. Most countries have a reasonable testing/contact tracing program. Even the US, which has done a piss poor job, is doing better than March/April.</p>
<p>With the supportive care, the whole world lost its damn mind with treating COVID. People were pushing crazy ideas like COVID was high altitude pulmonary edema. This theory was espoused by a sea-level emergency doc who was familiar with neither ARDS nor HAPE. People thought that these patients had better lung compliance than traditional ARDS and thought to perhaps give larger tidal volumes on the ventilator. They thought that these patients had higher rates of clots (might be true, but the reported rate is comparable to rates seen in similarly critically ill patients with septic shock or ARDS), and started administering therapeutic doses of anticoagulation despite no evidence of clots. Plenty of non-intensivists would report with amazement discoveries obvious to most seasoned pulmonologists or intensivists, like standard ventilator management worked after trying unproven modes like APRV or known harmful ones like oscillatory ventilation, or that less sedation and less paralytics had quicker recovery times. I helped write up some of the Lombardy Italy experience, and the docs there were throwing everything at patients, based on tweets they read. Give Ace inhibitors. Don't give them. Give hydroxychloroquine, kaletra, remdesivir, tocilizumab, plasma, etc, paralyze all these patients for weeks at a time, and then wonder why all the survivors were so profoundly weak. Things have calmed down to the point where these unproven meds aren't given as routinely as before.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have a better idea about transmission, and are more willing to let people use high flow nasal cannula instead of early intubation. In the US, there was a misconception that many patients needed early intubation. Now, most places will treat COVID like any other severe ARDS and intubate accordingly.</p>
<p>The biggest improvement in the past four months is that docs have calmed down and realized that the right course of action is to provide the same supportive care that we typically do for ARDS instead of relying on witchcraft.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ICU doc in New Orleans.</p>
<p>We realized pretty quickly that this isn't a disease that will resolve in a week. Not uncommon to care for a patient who's been on the ventilator for a month or longer.</p>
<p>Use much more therapeutic anticoagulation than we did when we started.</p>
<p>We pay close attention to the function of the kidneys when a patient is in respiratory failure. Often times we feel relieved if the patient is still making urine but are intubated on a ventilator (outcomes are much more favorable).</p>
<p>Everyone gets steroids and Remdesivir. We've been proning for severe ards the entire time. </p>
<p>Personally I haven't seen a significant change in mortality, but that's because I don't deal with the stable patients on the floor. We've adapted to using NIV pretty quickly at our institutions, so we didn't have too many patients that were intubated for requiring &gt;6 lpm oxygen. I think the biggest change in mortality (if there is one) between March and now would have to be because we are more hesitant to do something that harms the kidneys, and we've recognized that sometimes these people require 6 weeks or more on the ventilator.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the available access of cutting edge research/studies being shared so quickly is remarkable. For instance I read a  open source study that utilized combining a histamine 1 (cetirizine) blockade with a histamine 2 (famotimide) that resulted in lower mortality and improved condition with statistical significant blunting of the cytokines response resulting in overal improved status.
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7455799/#sec4title" target="_blank">Dual Histamine blockade response</a>. </p>
<p>Just the number of published open source  work is advancing treatment and saving lives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m an er doc. None of the meds have really done anything. We are better at managing the condition (proning, when to intubate, when to give steroids etc) but none of the fancy new meds seem to have mattered. Just like every viral respiratory disease, the only treatment is time and oxygen. Initially, in America, an older and sicker cohort got it and it made the icu mortality look grim. Now that the general population is getting it, the numbers look better.
Covid has perhaps shown us that all of these viral illnesses likely have a vascular component to them, this one is much stronger seemingly. There was a paper recently talking about young athletes with covid who all had abnormal cardiac mri’s. Got lots of press, scarred everyone. Truth is, kids with the flu have the same thing.
I have no hope for any treatments, only vaccinations that will likely only be partially effective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
