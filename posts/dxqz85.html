	<title>ELI5: In the 2000s, you could tell that a cell phone was about to receive a call/message because it would cause interference to audio devices (TV, stereo etc) a few seconds before the message arrived. When did this interference stop happening and why?</title>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Old 2G phones worked by each phone sending short bursts of signal, and then not transmitting for a time to allow other phones to talk.</p>
<p>When the phone receives a text or sets up a telephone call, it sends these bursts 216 times a second. The bursts of signal are picked up by wires in a sound system. Each burst produces a 'click', somehow, in the sound system. It is this string of 216 'clicks' per second that you hear as this buzz.</p>
<p>Once the call is made and the phone starts ringing, it sends the bursts much faster. This is still picked up as a string of clicks, but now it is too fast, too high a 'frequency', for the sound system to amplify and for you to hear.</p>
<p>Now the phones use other ways to allow many phones to talk at the same time. These systems don't send bursts of signal, and so you don't hear whatever gets picked up by the sound system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Today's 4G phones operate at much higher frequencies than the old phones, the higher frequencies interact less with typical electronics.  </p>
<p><strong>And</strong> as soon as electronics manufacturers realised everyone had a phone and were constantly using it, they started putting countermeasure in place: frequency filters that filter the frequencies phones operate at, and lead lengths that don't resonate with phone frequencies.  </p>
<p><strong>Finally</strong> modern transceivers are much, much better than what we had 20 years ago, allowing them to operate at much lower power, meaning less interference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
