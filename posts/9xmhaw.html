The propagation speed of the nerve conduction is something \~ 100 m/s in myelinated fibers, which is what most reflexes involve, so the overall time for a reaction is quite small to begin with.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's likely that's true on average, but not by that much. You have to go pretty long distances for it to make a measurable difference that a person would care about. In a Sensation and Perception course I took in college, we did an exercise where people linked up around the room and touched each others shoulders, only squeezing the shoulder of the person in front of them when they felt a squeeze on their own shoulder. We then did the same thing but replaced shoulders with feet, and it took a few seconds longer for the &quot;signal&quot; to go around the room. You're talking about that signal traversing like 30-40 people though.</p>
<p>The big thing though is the &quot;on average&quot; part. There's a lot of variability in reaction time within an individual, let alone between individuals of the same height. Even for a given peripheral nerve tract, there's going to be some variability in axonal diameter, which has a strong bearing on action potential propagation speed but I don't think is influenced by someone's height.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Technically probably, but only on average and not for any practical purpose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no.</p>
<p>A reflex arc does not need to go all the way to the brain, which is why reflexes are so fast.  </p>
<p>However, reflexes in common usage doesn’t necessarily mean a reflex arc.  So, I’m going to do the best I can to give you a satisfactory answer.</p>
<p>There are many mitigating factors that would make my answers moot.  Unhealthy nerves, diabetes, age, MS, alcohol, drugs, diet, and plenty more all change conduction times.  So, for the purposes of answering your question, we are looking at two people with perfectly healthy nerves and no lesions or deficits.</p>
<p>Myelinated nerves have a sheath on them, which speeds conduction times.  They can be fatty or made up of cells.  I like to think of them as insulated wire.  Peripheral nerves, like the ones in a reflex arc, or the ones in your spinal cord are going to be myelinated.  We can call myelinated nerves white matter.  Non myelinated nerves can be called grey matter, like the cortex of your brain, and have much slower conduction times.  </p>
<p>In myelinated nerves, a nerve impulse travels at 120 m/s (432 km/h or 275 mph).   When a tall person wearing socks steps in dog vomit at 3 AM, the sensory response does take longer to reach their sensory cortex than for a short person.  The difference in conduction time is extremely small, even between a 7 foot tall giant and a 5 foot tall pixie.  2 deer doesn’t take much time at the speed of the impulse.  </p>
<p>At this point, the sensory cortex has received a signal that something is not right and your brain begins processing this information.  You realize your foot is wet and that isn’t good.  This processing is not necessarily effected by height, maybe a neurologist can answer more succinctly.  </p>
<p>Your motor cortex sends a signal to your leg to recoil away from the present your dog left you.  This also takes very slightly longer for a tall person.  Measurable longer under the right conditions, but not much.</p>
<p>The short yes answer is nerve conduction takes longer for tall people because the impulse has longer to travel.</p>
<p>The no answer is because of the mitigating factors I mentioned above.  Let’s say our 7 foot tall giant is a 28 year old NBA player and our 5 foot pixie is a 68 year old overweight out of control diabetic with neuropathy and MS.  I would expect the former to have fat faster conduction times, even over the greater distance.  </p>
<p>TL;DR: nerve impulses do take longer to travel longer distances, but other factors interfere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
