		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quite new data shows that there are small drainages or &quot;sewer system&quot; in brain that activates when you sleep. It get's rid of bad metabolites and proteins from neurons that accumulate to brain during their activity, for example tau-proteins that are believed to be the cause of Alzheimers disease. But that is most probably just part of the answer.</p>
<p>I myself took part to that study to find that out, two MRI:s and simultanious EEG, one after staying awake for 24h and sleeping in the MRI tube and other after normal work day. I myself am clinical neurophysiologist and work with EEG:s and brain activity during sleep every day. Fascinating stuff and a lot to be discovered.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn’t very ELI5, but during a normal sleep cycle, our brain shrinks, allowing for the cerebrospinal fluid in the brain to be “flushed” and we get new csf. People that don’t get enough sleep, really do have a “cloudy” brain. This is called the glymphatic system and there’s a red talk about it. We also have time for muscles and everything to repair</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't believe no one is talking about the recent fly study findings.</p>
<p>Basically, fruit flies are a surprisingly good model for human sleep considering they aren't even mammals.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18591491/" target="_blank">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18591491/</a></p>
<p>So, a study was done on them to find a way to keep them alive without sleep, as similarly to humans and many other animals, severe sleep deprivation leads inevitably to death.</p>
<p>They found that just before dying, there was a large build up in toxic compounds in their gut.</p>
<p>More interestingly, they found by neutralising these toxins in the gut, the flies would live normal lifespans without sleep, implying that the cause of death was actually these compounds.</p>
<p>Obviously sleep is still baffling, but I think this is a very interesting step in the direction of figuring out what is going on.</p>
