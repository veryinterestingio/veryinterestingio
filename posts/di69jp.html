		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are scientists who study how songbirds learn to sing, and we recently published a study in which we incepted memories of songs into birds using a technique called optogenetics. This led the birds to learn a song that we programmed but that they never actually heard. This paper has been receiving quite a lot of attention and we would love to address people's questions about this technique and the paper's implications. Here is the paper: <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6461/83" target="_blank">https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6461/83</a>.</p>
<p>Joining us today are Dr. Maaya Ikeda, Therese Koch, Harshida Pancholi, and Dr. Massimo Trusel. They will be available from 3:00-5:00pm CDT (4-6 ET, 20-22 UT), ask them anything!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Last spring we got a puppy.  About the same time a bird nest nearby (unable to ID the type) had hatchlings.  The dog has a repetitive high pitch whine when she wants in the back door.  One day whilst sitting on the porch I hear the same whining noise only to realize that the dog &quot;Molly&quot; isn't outside and the noise is actually coming from the hatchlings as their mother was feeding them.  The birds were replicating the same whine noise as my dog in perfect pitch.  This continued until the birds left the nest.  I keep a bird feeder in my yard and every so often I hear the noise again from the grown hatchlings my wife and I have dubbed the Molly birds.  The sound is unmistakable and sounds nothing like the other birds.  Is this common?  Is the noise used for communication with other family members now?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
