		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Memory is a huge and complex topic which is not well understood.  There are different kinds of memory, but you seem to be asking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explicit_memory#Encoding_and_retrieval" target="_blank">long-term explicit memory</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking mostly from the realm of artificial neural networks, which are only loosely modeled on brain physiology, I think the most concise answer to your qeustion is that individual memories don't really &quot;take up space,&quot; but can be thought of more as additive, like waveforms.</p>
<p>If you're familiar with audio signals and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_analysis" target="_blank">Fourier analysis</a>, a note sounding in a room doesn't &quot;take up&quot; the room; although everything is resonant, there's &quot;room&quot; for other sounds at the same time.  A single musical instrument typically creates a plethora of different resonances which exist together in the same space more or less independently, vibrating the same air.  Similarly, a single wire can cary many different frequencies of signal independently.</p>
<p>Getting a little more technical, the &quot;space&quot; which you run out of when adding too much information in this model is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_space" target="_blank">&quot;phase space&quot;</a> rather than physical space.  Most likely, you lose the ability to distinguish between a large amount of overlaid information before you reach any physical limits on the underlying mechanisms by which the information is stored.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most comprehensive model at the moment (from a biological perspective) for understanding the cellular basis of memories is essentially identification through differentiation. Neurally, when a memory is accessed your brain relives that memory-specific network - called an engram. An engram can be thought of a synaptic trace, where individual memories will have distinct global (relatively speaking to the medial temporal lobe and adjacent parietal lobe) activation patterns that are roughly identical to that of the moment the memory was made. This will occur during early stages when the memory is in working, or short-term, memory, and as the memory moves to long-term memory it moves from medial temporal lobe (MTL) to what is considered cortex proper. This activation pattern in cortex is now representative of it's predecessor in MTL. These neurons are sitting, waiting for new information to transmit, synapses to form, strengthen/weaken, and to revisit existing engrams. It is unknown how many neurons comprise a single engram, but it is fair to assume that the answer is several million (with each neuron having tens to hundreds of thousands of synapses), making the number of combinations of neurons involved in the formation of engrams far exceeding the number of meaningful memories one can acquire in a lifetime. Funny enough, your question may beg the opposite question...why do we have so few memories?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Memory is retrieved not as a whole block like taking a movie out of the box and it's all there, it works by association. Some external stimulus gets you started, seeing and recognizing &quot;apple&quot;, and depending on what pathways were most commonly used, it leads towards the scent of apple pie, family gatherings and who was there speaking about which topics,... or it is connected to that nasty ER visit because of an allergic reaction. </p>
<p>A bit like stepping stones across a river, just that it's more of a vast lake with stepping stones all over. If one gap is too wide to cross, you can usually go around and find a different path. The more often you use a path, the easier it becomes to navigate and the less likely the stones disappear. </p>
<p>And disappear they do. The idea of &quot;family gathering&quot; can include many different events, and oddities are just added onto it. If that one always drunk uncle rants at every event, brain probably won't store what he said each time, just that he rants, annoyingly, all the time. A few days later you might still remember what exactly he said this time, but it will all blur together. But that one time he actually shut up? That is more likely retained as a crisp memory.</p>
<p>Most people can't remember what they had for breakfast on May 18th two years ago, unless that was somehow a very special day. So &quot;enormous&quot; amount of memories is relative. The most emotionally important ones tend to still be there, but not even all of those. Can you remember the second time you were invited to a birthday party? It was probably exciting at the time, but it's long since faded and you can reconstruct that it was probably fun, and miiiight have been for this or that friend, but that's reconstruction, not recall. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Dementias are stepping stones disappearing. The path can still be intact for the most part, but if crucial stones along the way are gone, there's no way to get to the memories anymore. Earlier life experiences have been embedded in a more complex network of different paths, recent ones didn't have a chance to develop side-routes yet, they're more vulnerable and tend to disappear first.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of memories as adding connections (stronger synapses) between strands on a spiderweb (neural networks). You add more connections as you get older (more associations between known symbols), while unused ones get pruned. With dementia such as Alzheimer's etc, some strands get broken. There are billions upon billions of connections between neurons, and strengthening of specific synapses by long-term potentiation etc lead to these connections between different neurons being more readily re-accessible (hence memories).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the underlying assumptions in my original question was whether memories use space in the brain. It is possible that they are themselves not physical as mass, but as waveforms. It is possible that there is some capacity but the brain regualry dumps material or reconfigures it into a more space-saving form - like compression. But I still find it difficult to get my head around the idea that storage of the waveforms, or whatever they are, does not take up some space, whether it is atomic, molecular or chemical, or electrical or magnetic. To be able to store data, such that it can be recalled at a later date, would seem to have to use some capacity? I do not know the science here but the underlying physics and information theory suggests that information storage must have a quantity property.</p>
<p>The original question was a little more specific, asking what that memory was used for, if anything before adulthood when all those memories accumulated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
