		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but keep in mind, nobody expects a child to be productive. People are fine with children learning language, having no vocabulary for maybe the first 3 years of their lives. Then those kids are sent to school for maybe another 10-20 years where the expectation is that they are learning.</p>
<p>Adults learning a new language don't have that benefit of no/low expectations and free time to do nothing but learn. You're expected to be economically productive while learning, so it's nearly impossible to be immersed in an environment where you cannot already speak the language to some degree.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends. The key to language learning is having people who are willing to get on your level like parents do with a child, which you basically have to pay someone to do when your level is zero unless you have an exceptionally close relationship with a speaker of the target language. If the question is &quot;Can you learn a language from zero without translating to your own language?&quot;, the answer is absolutely yes; if it's &quot;Can you learn a language without any concentrated effort or formal instruction at all?&quot;, the answer for most non-savant people is no.</p>
<p>I work in a language center that teaches students only in the target language, even if the students come in with zero knowledge of the target language on day one. It's pretty simple: you use objects and actions instead of translating. For example, you have a native speaker teaching and some toy animals. The teacher puts out the dog and cat, points to each one and says &quot;dog&quot; and &quot;cat&quot; in the target language, then asks &quot;Where is the dog?&quot; and &quot;Where is the cat?&quot; Students just point to the correct one and don't have to respond verbally. You slowly add more animals, continuing to ask repeatedly where both old and new objects are, and after 10-15 minutes, students have easily learned 12-15 animals and the simple sentence form &quot;Where is...?&quot; This is very similar to how parents interact with babies and toddlers playing with toys/real objects or looking at pictures in books.</p>
<p>For actions, the teacher will stand up and say &quot;Stand up&quot;, then gesture at the students to join. Then she will sit back down and say &quot;Sit down&quot;. Then she commands them to do these things, and they respond by obeying the command. Slowly add more actions, and at the end of 10 minutes they've learned 10-12 new verbs and the basic command form of a verb, with all interaction only in the target language.</p>
<p>Then you build from there, first just using toy objects and basic demonstrable actions for the first month or so, then moving on to picture books that the students and teacher take turns describing, then stories like Cinderella that the students are already familiar with but are now only hearing in the target language, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>You can actually learn very quickly and much less painfully than traditional methods this way, as you don't have to memorize long lists of words and their translations. Within six months of taking 20 hrs a week of these kinds of classes, you can have an intelligent conversation on a wide variety of topics in your target language, granted still with grammar mistakes and some vocab limitations.</p>
<p>Can you get the same benefit outside of classes? Sure, you could do all of these activities without a paid teacher, but you would still need to put in concentrated effort with someone who is willing to get on your level. It is highly unlikely that you get these understandable interactions in enough concentration just through random everyday interactions with strangers. So in summary, yes you can learn like a child in only the target language, but it is unlikely to happen spontaneously.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While children <em>acquire</em> language effortlessly until about the age of ten, adults have to consciously <em>learn</em> a new language. That being said, full immersion is the best way to do that. My cousin speaks 6 languages, 2 as a child, the other four by going to live with families for a year in other countries.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To a degree, yes. I believe it's called immersion learning. In that scenario you would also need to try to understand and ideally try to communicate in some way. That's what kids do, even if it's babbling at that point. </p>
<p>You won't learn it perfectly, but even as an adult, you can pick up words and phrases that way. </p>
<p>We do it all the time with slang and such already. A lot of the time the first time you hear it, you have no clue what it means. Then you get it put into context and slowly start using it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Keep in mind, though, that a baby takes a few months before he starts to speak his first words. It takes years and years to develop their language and they keep learning.</p>
<p>But yes, that is a way to learn, and in my humble opinion, one of the best ways to learn.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
