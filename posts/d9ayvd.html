<p>Cold water, well at least mine right now, is 54 degrees. </p>
<p>So, your hot water virtually always less than 10 degrees above body temperature, but your cold water can be 45 degrees or so below. </p>
<p>Bigger difference, bigger shock.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Warm water makes you conserve energy by being an external heat source. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd say there are many reasons behind this, but if I understand the question correctly, I'd say the biggest contributor is homeostasis - and the body's huge efforts to keep it stable.</p>
<p>Your body works hard to upkeep its natural temperature of ~37°C. If the temperature surrounding you drops, it 'pushes' the blood from less vital points to the more important ones - basically, from your limbs, to your core. </p>
<p>That is to show that your body will always react to a temperature difference, meaning that a change in temperature will send a signal to the brain - in the case of putting your hand beneath cold (read: colder, or much colder, than your body temp.) water, it will send a shock to your system, telling you that you should get out of there, because it makes it harder for the body to upkeep the needed temp(for operation, mobility, biochemistry of the body.)</p>
<p>To add to that, measuring temperature with how it feels is always relative. Your body cannot switch given temperatures at a snap of a second, as it goes against the laws of physics. If you're normal body temp, at home and warm, cold water will feel jarring because of the stark difference. If you've come home from being outside during winter, lukewarm or hot water will 'burn' your hands, because they have become cold in the low temperatures outside. The difference in temperature will always feel unpleasant, because your body cannot accomodate quickly, and neither can it handle the shift very easily (it causes stress on the skin and muscles.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
