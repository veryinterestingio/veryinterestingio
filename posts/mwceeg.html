		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of being dehydrated is that your body refrains from processing too much waste from your blood in to our bladder because it needs to expend water to do so. When you finally start hydrating again your kidneys start going back to work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body can only make urine within certain limits. It is mostly water and the rest is urea and other waste chemicals filtered by your kidneys.</p>
<p>Now when you are dehydrated and your Body is building up more and more of these waste Chemicals in your blood it may seem like it would be easy to just make pee with less water and more waste but your body straight up can't do this past a certain point so they keep building up.  While dehydrated you may feel the urge to pee more frequently with little coming out and feel irritation in your bladder. Your body is just trying to manage its waste as best it can. So when you drink water after being dehydrated for some time your body says &quot;yes this is what I have been needing!&quot; And will immediately go to work to try and get back to homeostasis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>It can't just absorb it all.</p>
<p>When you pee, that's water mixed with substances your kidneys have filtered out of your blood like dead cells.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
