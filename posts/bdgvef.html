		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just wondering. It would seem the only natural application to (seemingly, but are actually there ankles ie flamingos) rear bending knees are things like birds that always crouch forward. Most all the 4 legged Boston dynamic robots bend there joint backwards, and they seemed to have JUST got decent two legged ones that walk anatomically similar to humans. Why don’t they just imitate the nature that works? Thanks.</p>
<p>Edit: I wanna thank everybody. And for everyone that maybe didn’t understand how I worded the sentence but I tried saying between the parenthesis that I know the rear bending knee most of the time is just seemingly so, I’m aware that those are actually ‘ankles’. Also.. my main question was about the humanoids they make. They just got the point of having that two legged one walk ‘normal’ and jump up stairs, flip, etc and I was wondering why they didn’t do it anatomically from the beginning. Anyone who hasn’t seen those search all the Boston dynamic vids there cool. Thanks again guys.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is: <a href="https://sci-hub.tw/10.1088/1748-3190/10/1/016011" target="_blank">because it's more efficient</a>! </p>
<p>In the simplest sense: figures 21 and 22 in the linked study show that if you eliminate hip movement, the backward bending leg can still make progression towards the following step. The forward bending leg can't. So the forward bending leg will always require more hip movement than the backward bending leg. </p>
<p>The data in the experiments indeed show that the hip movement is much less important in backward bending legs than forward bending legs. Also, there is a slight advantage in shock damping.</p>
<p>EDIT: Sorry, forgot I was on the university network at the time of writing, so you probably won't be able to see the full article (the main idea is explained in the abstract). Will try to provide some more information tomorrow.</p>
<p>EDIT2: Fixed link (thanks u/quote_engine) : Interpretation of the results starting p10 is where it's most interesting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it's not true that 4 legged animals all have &quot;forward bending&quot; legs. They do but they also don't.
So, what animal can climb, run and walk well? We probably want these on our robot, right?
Maybe a goat?: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Goat_skeleton.jpg" target="_blank">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Goat_skeleton.jpg</a>
Maybe a cat?:

<p>Notice how their legs also bends backwards, not on the &quot;knee&quot; yes, but they're not only forward bending either.</p>
<p>Funny note, even us humans have &quot;back bending legs&quot;, which is our feet and ankles, the only difference is after they bend back they also touch to the ground: our heels.</p>
<p>So, since they're robots, it's to be expected to not have the exact same structure as an animal (no need to exactly design a &quot;feet&quot; if a round surface can do the same job) but if you compare the skeletons and have an &quot;overall&quot; look, they're quite similar to many animals.</p>
<p>Hope it helped.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tangential but important: evolution doesn't necessarily select for <em>best</em>. Simply <em>good enough</em>.</p>
<p>The only time that <em>best</em> or even <em>better</em> traits will evolve, is when there is direct competition. If, hypothetically, 2 species existed: one with forward knees, one with rear-facing knees, and if these two species has similar diet, in the same area, or were in competition for breeding grounds ... some form of competition .. then the best feature would likely win the day, and evolution would trend that way. </p>
<p>But as far as I know, that never happened. The knees we have evolved first, they were good enough to move their owners around to get food and reproduce, so they stuck. </p>
<p>Evolution is a bit of a crapshoot like that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It all comes down to how you define what a &quot;knee&quot; is, there's at least three ways based on human anatomy:</p>
<ul>
<li>The joint in the middle of the leg</li>
<li>The first joint after the hip (the second joint from the top)</li>
<li>The first joint after the ankle (the second joint from the bottom, <em>if</em>  we ignore all the joints in the foot).</li>
</ul>
<p>Most robots that have backwards bending &quot;knees&quot; only have two joints. From the perspective of how their feet interact with the ground, that joint is much more like an ankle, it controls the angle of the foot hitting the ground. And in that sense it works just like our ankle, and bends &quot;backwards&quot; for the same reason our ankles bend that way. When you walk forwards, it's useful to be able to push off with your foot, so you want the joint behind the foot, which pushes forwards when the joint opens. Boston Dynamic's humanoid robot has feet with joints, and it has forward facing knees and &quot;backwards&quot; (i.e. normal to us) facing ankles that do this job and let it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LikxFZZO2sk" target="_blank">push off with each step</a>.  </p>
<p>This is also the reason why flamingos look like they have <a href="https://www.aviary.org/animals/American-Flamingo" target="_blank">backwards bending knees</a>. They're really standing on their &quot;tip toes&quot;, and the joint we see is their ankle. Imagine you wanted to make a robot flamingo, you might simplify it by deleting the top of their leg (<a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/170615/original/file-20170523-5763-k87ko.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip" target="_blank">which is way up beside their body</a>) and make the first joint the &quot;knee&quot;.</p>
<p>In a lot of ways knees and ankles are interchangeable, their orientation just depends on what's happening below them. And actually, if people need to have their lower leg amputated, in some case they can replace their knee joint with their ankle by turning it around and reattaching it. And it works <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQVAHbAV8QM" target="_blank">amazing well</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
