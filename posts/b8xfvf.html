		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hold your finger in front of your face and slowly move it around your head. Follow it with your eyes keeping your head facing forward and try to note the position at which you can no longer see it. You may find that if you wiggle your finger when you can no longer see it then you can sense the movement (sort of like a T Rex), and that the point at which this happens is slightly behind you.    This allows you to be alerted to movement slightly behind you and turn your head to focus on it more clearly and make sure it's not dangerous. What's weird is how instinctively we use it, so much so that we don't even know it. It's hard enough to fully understand how we perceive our own vision without even trying to understand other creatures.</p>
<p>We are primarily a predator species, but with eyes slightly further apart than something like an eagle, allowing us to focus on prey in front of us, but also be aware of dangers to our sides without turning our heads.</p>
<p>For prey species like deer, having eyes on the side of their head allows them to look even further behind them than we can to give them a better chance of spotting predators.  They don't need to focus on their prey because grass doesn't run away.</p>
<p>It's been pointed out that I got sidetracked and off the point I was originally steering towards. What I think I was trying to get at is that you mostly perceive your vision to be continuous, but you have blind spots, and spots that can only sense movement. Things like the finger experiment I mentioned above expose your own vision's shortcomings.</p>
<p>Animals like deer likely perceive their own vision to be continuous, but the part of their vision that's directly in front of their face would act like yours does at the side. Imagine having a blind spot directly in the forefront of your vision. Sort of like how most of the time you don't see your nose until you think about it. Like you are right now. Sorry.</p>
<p><em>edit</em> didn't realise this was going to be a gold-worthy response but thank you kind stranger. Never had one before so I don't quite know what to do with it. Maybe I'll build a school for grasses that can't run good and want to learn how to do other stuff good too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chameleon (as far as we know it) have similar vision to us. Their lens are concave while their cornea is more convex shaped giving them more 'pinhole/tunnel vision'. Yes, often one eye is kept on watching predators and prey near them while the opposite eye will continue to scan its surroundings for other dangers</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the species.</p>
<p>Most animals with eyes on either side of their head will have about a 200 degree field of vision each side of the body. They generally have a blind spot directly behind them and in front of their snouts/noses until the field of vision crosses over.</p>
<p>Whilst they have good vision on their sides because there is only one eye they generally have problems with depth perception on the sides. Directly in front of them the can have good binoculars vision if their fields of view cross over.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/24/4010" target="_blank">link</a> is an article specifically about hammerhead sharks but has good illustrations to demonstrate what they can see.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
