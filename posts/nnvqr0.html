All I know is that they are cities that are “twinned with another city” and that they are for “promoting commercial and cultural exchange” but I don’t understand how it play out irl.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After the world wars a lot of people became rather concerned that there might be another war. There was the idea that if people knew  people in cities on the other side they might be less willing to kill them.</p>
<p>Twinning cities around the globe was seen as a bit of diplomacy on a local level. Cultural exchanges between cities helped to see each other as people instead of some undefined and abstract potential enemy.</p>
<p>Cities were usually chosen so that they had something in common like a shared industry or similar. In some cases that took a bit of a morbid turn like the example of Dresden being twinned with Coventry as both cities had been the victims of aerial bombings during WWII.</p>
<p>From the original cold war efforts that saw a lot of twinning across the iron curtain this eventually expanded to efforts to twin cities everywhere.</p>
<p>In some cases this was taken rather hilarious levels as for example the town named Boring in Oregon is twinned with Dull in Scotland and Bland in Australia.</p>
<p>Generally the thought behind it remains the same though. To show people that the inhabitants of some foreign city are people just like you and that they have interesting culture and nice people and that it would be stupid to see them as evil foreigners that needed to be fought or bombed.</p>
<p>It also give city officials a reason to spend taxpayer money to travel around the world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For us it meant a town of similar size and composition where the high schools would partner up kids as pen-pals, the towns would run exchange programs and generally act as micro-destinations for their citizens. It was nice for us to visit our partner town in Germany and their students would visit us for a couple of weeks. I guess it's about having a pre-built relationship that the entire town gets to take advantage of. Like having a cousin in another country.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it as your city having a pen pal somewhere else in the world.  You have fun learning about each other's cultures, maybe send small presents, teach lessons in school, and a lucky few get to visit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
