		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Any object with mass gains weight as it gains speed. Near the speed of light we always say that it gains &quot;infinite&quot; mass, thus it requires infinite enegy to get to the speed of light.
My question is that is there a point where the object is so massive because of this that its radius would become lower than the Schwarzschild radius, and should become a black hole?
If yes, what would happen?
Wouldn't the object slow down enough, that it would revert back from this state?</p>
<p>Let's assume, that we have a spaceship that can stand the forces imparted on it, we have infinite fuel, and an infinite clear path in space to do that. </p>

<p>This is a commonly thrown around thing that isn't really used in physics anymore. Relativistic mass causes more issues than it resolves, so we stick to rest mass and relativistic energy instead.</p>
<p>The answer to your question is no, because black holes have to be black holes from every reference frame, and in the rest frame of the spaceship its rest mass isn't sufficient for it to collapse into a black hole.</p>
<p>Edit: I see some people asking why relativistic mass is outdated, I'll just leave <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ay02xh/could_a_fast_enough_spaceship_become_a_black_hole/ehz1i5h/" target="_blank">this comment</a> here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Well, there's your black hole right there!</p>
<p>All joking aside, remember that an engine just converts potential energy (chemical, nuclear, whatever) into kinetic energy (of the ship and its exhaust). Whatever kinetic energy the ship has, must have existed as potential energy in the fuel. From the point of view of an observer outside the ship, the ship is losing mass as it burns fuel and gains speed. The total energy of the ship will decrease, as it expels exhaust with finite momentum and kinetic energy. If it had enough energy to become a black hole, it would have done so before the engine started.</p>
<p>(Also, what everyone else said about how simple linear movement won't create a black hole. To an observer inside the ship, the ship is stationary, and black holes would have to exist for all observers.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. Relativistic mass is just the regular mass corrected for the fact that the classical momentum equation (p = mv) is not valid for v close to the speed of light. You can correct the equation by multiplying either m by something, or v by something. If you multiply m by the correction factor, you get the relativistic mass. The mass doesn't actually change. More detailed explanation below:</p>
<p>An accelerating spaceship keeps getting closer and closer to the speed of light (relative to you). 0.9c, 0.99c, 0.999c, and so on. The classical momentum equation would imply that the maximum momentum is simply m*c, but we also know that something can keep accelerating forever but never reach the speed of light. Thus, your spaceship that is constantly accelerating is still gaining momentum quite rapidly although its speed relative to you isn't changing that much, meaning that the classical momentum equation p=mv is not correct. This is resolved by multiplying mv by gamma, which is exactly the ratio of relativistic momentum (the one you would observe in reality) to classical momentum (the one you would calculate with p=mv). It goes towards infinity as speed gets closer and closer to the speed of light, c.</p>
<p>You can then attempt to correct p = m*v*gamma by using a corrected velocity equal to v*gamma, or a corrected mass equal to m*gamma. The relativistic mass is exactly this corrected mass so that you can continue to use the velocity you measure, only introducing gamma to find out momentum (among other things). Now imagine that we instead fixed the velocity. Now your effective velocity, v*gamma, can exceed the speed of light. Does this mean that objects can travel faster than light? No, they can't. Similarly, objects don't gain mass as they go faster relative to you.</p>
<p>Side fact 1: the corrected velocity does actually have significance, however. As you go faster, the universe actually starts to shrink (flatten) in your direction of travel. v*gamma ends up being your *apparent* speed in your frame. So you can travel 10 light years in less than 10 years *within your frame*, but to an outside observer at rest from earth, you would still be going less than the speed of light. If they could peer into your spaceship, they would actually see that your time is running much slower than theirs, *even after correcting for the doppler effect caused by light having a finite speed*.</p>
<p>Side fact 2: in a branch of physics called solid state physics, &quot;effective mass&quot; is used in a similar manner to how relativistic mass works above. You have some equation that works according to a theory that doesn't describe all the things going on but still works well, and then you have an observation. You can correct the equation by multiplying the mass by some factor. Some equations used in solid state physics end up not capturing the behavior of some particles very well, so the equation predicts a value with the wrong sign! i.e., if you correct the mass, you end up with *negative mass*! Similarly to above, the particle's mass is unaffected, it just behaves equivalently to a particle with a different mass but that behaves exactly according to the theory. And above, if we want our spaceship to behave perfectly according to classical mechanics, we have to give it a higher effective mass, despite the spaceship's mass being constant.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some great responses here! One thing I would add, since you specifically mentioned the Schwarzschild radius, is that its derivation actually requires some very specific assumptions, one of which is spherical symmetry. That is to say, there must be no preferred direction. So whilst you might get a 'relativistic mass' that, in the objects rest frame would cause it so collapse into a black hole, if we factor in it's motion relative to us (breaking spherical symmetry), then the Schwarzschild radius derivation looks radically different, and stops it from collapsing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One object moving close to the speed of light doesn't create a black hole per se. But if we have a reference object with a mass, then we have an angular momentum, which does contribute to the energy density tensor. This is different than kinetic energy because we can't get rid of it by changing reference frames. From the point of view of the space-ship, it's not moving at all. But if there is a reference mass, then from the view of the space-ship that mass is becoming faster and faster. And from the point of view of the reference mass the space-ship is also becoming faster. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It is my understanding, after going through the formulas in the wiki article on rotating black holes (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerr_metric" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerr\_metric" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerr\_metric</a></a>), that this system can form a black hole with inner and outer event horizons. The total energy of the system, that contributes to the mass in the Schwarzschild radius does include the rotational energy, which becomes larger the faster the objects move relative to each other. In order for it to form a black hole the entire system needs to be contained within the event horizons. So basically the space-ship would have to reach a certain speed relative to the reference mass, in order to form a black hole together with it. Once it does that, there is no escape.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now the original question was if there is a process that prevents the space-ship and reference mass from getting to that point in the first place. And this is a difficult question to answer correctly. the reason is that the solutions for the Einstein equation are based on the idea that the configuration is already such, that a black hole exists. Due to the specific complexity (non-linearity) the Einstein equations would have to be solved separately for the scenario of the space-ship coming up to speed including the warping of space-time in the process. </p>
<p>My guess is that there would be nothing stopping the formation of a rotating black hole, if the space ship is set up to reach an appropriately high speed by the time it gets close enough to the reference mass.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
