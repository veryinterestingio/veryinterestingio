<p>There are tiny muscles in your eye that can squeeze the lens, which is a lot like changing the focus on a camera or projector to see something farther away or closer to you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On a related side-note, consider what happens when you watch a 3D movie (using glasses):</p>
<p>your eyes have to focus on the screen on which the movie is projected, which is always at the same distance from you (assuming you're not moving from your seat); yet your eyes have to track the 3D image as it <em>appears</em> to move closer or further away in the 3D space. This messes with your eyes and with your visual cortex and explains why many people get headaches or feel disoriented during or after watching 3D movies. </p>
<p>Every time there's a resurgence of interest in 3D technology I look at it and predict it will fail to catch on (see the recent failure of 3D TVs to become a big thing) due to this issue. It will take a technology similar to holography for 3D to work properly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, it's very subtle, but our eyes cross and uncross to focus on objects closer or further away. If you want to learn how to cross your eyes, you start by focusing on your nose. If you want to un-cross them, focus on a mountain in the distance. Your brain measures the distance between your pupils and calculates distance accordingly.  </p>
<p>This also explains why those with &quot;lazy eyes&quot; can typically still see fine. Their brain adds the abnormal pupil distance in its calculations when translating the visual stimuli.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what has been answered already, the natural (relaxed) focus of the eye is far away objects. Focussing on nearby objects means high eye muscle tension. So when you get older, the muscles age, and you need glasses for reading.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
