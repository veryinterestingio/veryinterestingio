		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>because fruit aren't intended to be nutritious, they're intended to be tasty, which means the bulk of them is relatively homogeneous fluff with lots of sugar. The skin is the only part which has to actually do something important, so its loaded up with a variety of vitamins and minerals and other cellular necessities to do its job.</p>
<p>same applies to like, why wheat germ is more nutritious than the rest of the grain. The rest of it is just an energy store. The germ has all the parts that grow and do stuff, so all the goodies are found there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In biology it's useful to look at the function of a particular part of an organism to understand it's structure and function.</p>
<p>The function of skin/peel is important in understanding why they're different to the &quot;innards&quot; of the fruit/vegetable. Plants are non-mobile so need to adapt to changes in their environment without running/flying/swimming away from a change as an animal would.</p>
<p>For instance, if it's really warm, animals would seek shelter, plants can't so need to adapt to their environment.</p>
<p>So that begs the question: why do fruits and vegetables differ from leaves? Well, leaves have a specific function, to produce glucose from sunlight, but they're not very protected from being eaten by bugs, this is a trade off.</p>
<p>Tubers are energy storage but also don't need the trade off that leaves have to have, therefore they can't produce a protective layer that's fibrous.</p>
<p>Fruits are colourful to attract animals to eat them because they are the reproductive parts of a plant and want to be spread to allow reproduction. Antioxidants are generally pigmented, which allows the fruit to be both colourful and protected from its environment. Fibre is generally a tough structure, again for protection from damage, from the sun, the rain, snow etc. </p>
<p>The main takeaway is that plants are non-mobile and need to protect themselves from their environment. For fruits, they're the reproductive structures of a plant and want to spread to allow more of a specific plants to grow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The skins of fruits have the chemicals that make them different colours so that they stand out. These fruit colour chemicals are a bit like vitamins, and the inside of the fruit is mostly sugar and water to make it taste nice so that people and animals want to eat it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the comments here are half ass backwards and profoundly inaccurate.</p>
<p>Nutrition can not be reduced down to black &amp; white blanket statements, be they questions like OP or answers here below.  </p>
<p><a href="https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/10169/are-most-of-the-nutrients-of-vegetables-and-fruits-contained-in-the-peel" target="_blank">Here</a> is the most comprehensive and balanced explanation I've been able to find so far that puts things in proper context.  </p>
<p>tldr:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In <em>some</em> fruits and vegetables, the skins contain major amounts of <em>certain</em> nutrients, in particular phytochemicals. But it's wrong to say as a blanket statement for all fruits and vegetables that &quot;most of the nutrients are contained in the peel&quot;.</p>
