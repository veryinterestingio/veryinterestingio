<ol>
<li>
<p>When a blackbody absorbs electromagnetic radiation  how that energy gets absorbed depends entirely on the radiation's frequency. Some frequencies cause molecular vibrations, rotations, bending...other specific frequencies cause election excitation. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the object reaches thermal equilibrium (determined by the absorption of frequencies causing various vibrations), it begins to emit energy to maintain an equilibrium. It emits energy both through heat and light.  The light is due to only the relaxation of elections to lower energy states.

<p>If (and that's a big if) the above is an appropriate way of describing it, it seems as though backbodies should not emit continuous spectra, but line spectra instead. I want to justify this by saying there are so many interactions in a solid that weird stuff happens with the orbitals and energy levels so there's nearly an infinite number of possible states for excited electrons. This would imply zooming enough, the continuous spectrum would actually look like a line spectrum (I know, blackbodies are an idealized situation anyway).</p>

<li>An overarching concept: Is ALL light attributed the excitation/relaxation of electrons?</li>

<p>Yes, although the microscopic details of what kinds of excitations are happening is not relevant to the derivation of the black body spectrum. All that matters is that each mode of the electromagnetic field is absorbed and emitted in quanta (photons).</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Thermal equilibrium is independent of any microscopic property of the black body. That's one of the really nice results of thermodynamics: thermal equilibrium just means that the object has the same temperature as its surroundings. Nothing else matters. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the black body doesn't just start emitting radiation at equilibrium, it's <em>always</em> emitting and absorbing radiation. Once equilibrium is reached, the amount of energy being lost by emission is equal to the amount being absorbed.</p>
<p>Heat and light are the same thing for these purposes, as derivations of black body laws neglect the fact that the body may be able to have heat conducted or convected to and from it. So the only heat transfer mechanism relevant here is radiation.</p>
<p>And the black body can emit any frequency that it absorbs, so the point about the outgoing frequencies being different than the incoming is not really true.</p>

<p>Transitions between discrete states gives a set of discrete lines in the absorption and emission spectrum, but as you mentioned, solids don't really have discrete levels anymore, but rather continuous bands of allowable energies. And electrons can transition to and from continuum states, which don't have discrete energies. For example, take an electron capturing onto a proton and forming a hydrogen atom. If we set the zero for potential energy such that an electron at infinite distance from the proton with zero kinetic energy has zero total mechanical energy, and we say that the electron captures into a bound state of energy -E', and send in an electron from infinity with kinetic energy E, the electron will make a transition from a continuum state with energy E to a bound state with energy -E'. This transition will occur through the emission of a photon with energy E + E' (assuming the transition is direct into the bound state without any kind of cascade). E' is a discrete energy determined by the structure of the Coulomb potential, but E is a continuous energy. It's the kinetic energy of the free particle that we sent in from infinity; it can take on any non-negative value. So therefore the photon energy E + E' is also a continuous value. And we can go a step further and discuss free-free transitions, where the electron emits a bremsstrahlung photon and remains in an unbound state afterwards, where both the initial and final energies of the electron are continuous.</p>
<p>So this illustrates that there are processes in which the energy absorbed or emitted are not discrete. It's these kinds of processes which make the spectrum of thermal radiation continuous rather than discrete.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>There are other ways to generate photons, for example nuclear transitions which emit gamma rays. In our everyday lives, it's often the behavior of electrons which is responsible for the light that we encounter. But as described above, that doesn't mean that light spectra always have to be discrete.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>This means the emitted light is only &quot;returning&quot; the radiation in various frequencies that went into electron excitation - not the radiation that caused vibrations. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn't true.  Just as vibrations (and other atomic/molecular motions) can absorb radiation as you mentioned in point 1, they can and do emit radiation that contributes to blackbody radiation.  Furthermore, vibrations and electrons are not isolated from each other, and can be strongly coupled in solids.  They rapidly exchange energy internally to reach their own thermal equilibrium.  Another consequence of this coupling is that this statement:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>is pretty accurate!  Because of this, we do a lot of spectroscopic studies of certain materials at very low temperatures so that there are fewer vibrations messing with and broadening the electron states we want to study.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the missing puzzle piece that leads to your question is heat. </p>
<p>There is a random motion between molecules as the bounce off each other that we call heat. They also can change energy states of the molecule when this happens. </p>
<p>They can reach excited states from heat, and then get to lower energy states by emitting energy. Similarly they can absorb light, bounce into something, and return to ground state and heat up the thing they bounced into. </p>
<p>The second part about emitting only like spectra: single molecules have absorption lines. But the frequency of those lines bounces around as molecules find themselves in different local environments (like being about to bounce off another molecule). This smears out the lines for the aggregate to give a broad spectrum. It does the same thing for absorption as well. </p>
<p>You get good line spectra from things like gasses and crystals, where the interactions are few or well defined. Something like a dye in a liquid, where there are lots of interactions with the liquid, has a very broad spectrum. </p>
<p>Your intuition is right though. For a good black body emitter you want a random material with lots of different molecules. (Or a metal, random sea of electrons)</p>
<p>It your &quot;black body&quot; a single pure molecular substance the resulting blackbody radiation can be screwed greatly by the materials absorption/emission lines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
