How come this molten metal at the Earths core retains its magnetic properties instead of losing it due to not having a defined north and south pole for the magnetic field to form around?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The magnetic field of the Earth is caused by an extremely complex and not fully understood phenomenon called the earth's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo_theory" target="_blank">geodynamo</a>. </p>
<p>The short answer is that the magnetic field is not held in completely the same way as a standard permanent magnet, as the core is far above the Curie Temperature, the temperature at which a metal loses the ability to be a permanent magnet, rather it is actively generated by the rotation of the Earth spinning a electrically conductive fluid. </p>
<p>Heat from the inner iron solid core of the earth drives convection currents in the liquid iron outer core which, combined with the rotation of the earth bending these flows into cylindrical patterns, induce electric currents in the molten iron which in turn produce the magnetic field of the earth. The dynamo phenomenon is extremely complex beyond ELI5 levels, but it the leading theory for where the magnetic fields of stars and planets comes from.</p>
<p>TLDR: The Earth's core is a heat and rotation powered electromagnet</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're two completely different mechanisms. A permanent magnet has field lines solidified to a particular shape. In a planet, the field is generated dynamically by flow. If it stopped, the field would disappear.</p>
<p>The fluid doesn't have to be molten metal: on Uranus, the fluid that generates the planetary magnetic field is a condensed water-ammonia mix.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Molten metals loose their fixed magnetism because they don't have fixed aligned regions when they're melted, but it's not the only way magnetism occurs. </p>
<p>From what I understand the Earth's core kinda acts as a giant dynamo, with the pressure on the inner core making it act as a solid and the convection currents and rotation due to the planets motion in the outer core leading to moving flows, which together create a magnetic field</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
