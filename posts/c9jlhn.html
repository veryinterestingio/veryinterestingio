		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Immediately upon leaving the vehicle it would be traveling at 60mph. </p>
<p>If that vehicle is a spaceship traveling in vacuum, the fly would continue traveling at 60mph until it hit something. </p>
<p>On earth, the fly would leave the vehicle doing 60mph, and then have to cut through the static wind doing ~0mph around it's non-aerodynamic body. </p>
<p>Odds are it would spiral out of control until the wind speeds around the fly's body were something it's wings could control.  </p>
<p>Depending on a TON of specifics, there is a speed where if they fly leaves the vehicle the wind forces around it's body will start tearing things off of it, like wings and legs.  </p>
<p>However, fly appendages are really strong for their size and it's more likely that the forces tearing wings off instead just slow the fly down before any real damage occurs. </p>
<p>Going the other way, you could presumably have a fly outside the vehicle going 60mph, flying under it's own power IF you had a sufficient wind block/fan system that kept the fly's tailwind around 60MPH-[Fly's top speed].</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The fly's mass vs. it's surface area on that kind of scale would be such a negligible force, it would likely almost instantaneously halt in the air and just keep flying.  Air molecules are much more of a force at that scale than they are at our scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ever stand right at the edge of a road with cars going by at 60+?  You feel a pretty big gust of wind every time one goes by. This is because the air right outside the car isnâ€™t at 0mph, it is moving with the car. The car pushes some air out if the way, some air (a tiny bit) sticks directly to the car and everything in between is somewhere in between the speed of the car and zero. </p>
<p>So the fly will slow down quickly but not instantly. It will get blown into the swirling air behind the car and tumble around while it slows down along with all the air around it. Probably not a pleasant experience by any stretch but I doubt the fly is ever in any real pain or danger when this happens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The inertia it has while in your closed-off car remains the same, but the air pressure outside your car is higher than inside due to the movement.  So, any inertial force the fly had inside the car immediately gets cancelled out and the fly kinda stops in mid-air as the car goes flying right past it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
