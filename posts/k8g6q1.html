		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, you've sort of answered your own question! This is, strangely, kind of a question of mathematics.</p>
<p>Artificial flavouring added to any product is, in essence, particles inserted into the 'delivery mechanism' (in this case, the gum) which interact with receptors in the tongue to send signals to the brain interpreting a flavor.</p>
<p>I've never tried fruit stripe gum, to my knowledge it's not sold where I live, but I would assume that the flavouring added to the gum is not particularly well incorporated into the delivery mechanism. This means that on first chewing the gum those particles of flavour are all released at once, leading to a very pronounced, but fleeting signal from the flavour receptors. Once all of the flavour is released, however, the gum itself is inherently mostly flavourless and so you cease tasting anything beyond that point.</p>
<p>In other gums, there may be exactly as much flavouring added (just for arguments' sake) but if it is more effectively bound to the delivery mechanism it will take more chewing to free those particles. This results in a weaker flavour, but released over a longer period of time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Side note. Buddy of mine has a disorder called PKU (you're tested for it at birth) where his body can't process an amino acid called Phenylalanine. He can only have gum with natural sugars because phenylalanine is in artificial sweeteners. Additionally he also can't have any meat, just fish. If he does consume phenylalanine, it will build up in his body and brain and &quot;poison&quot; his brain cells leading to mental deficits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
