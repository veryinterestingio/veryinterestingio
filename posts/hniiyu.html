		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Liters, cubic inches or cubic centermetres (cc's) for smaller motorcycle engines all reference the displacement of the area inside the piston cylinders where the gas and air mix and explode to provide the force that moves the pistons, and thus moves the car. </p>
<p>In general, the more explody gas action from more cubic inches or liters or whatever, the more power you get from an engine. However there's lots of nuances to it. There are ways to get a relatively small (like 1.4L) 4 cylinder engine to produce almost as much (horse)power as a larger 3.6L V6 engine for example, likewise a modern 3.6L V6 engine from today may have the same amount of horsepower as a big 5L V8 from 15 years ago. </p>
<p>But stuff like torque and energy efficiency and compression ratios and turbo/super charging is a bit beyond the ELi5 level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a recent discussion with my son.  &quot;ELI9&quot; ;-)</p>
<p>The engine's pistons work like legs on pedals on a bicycle, and cars usually have 4, 6 or 8 of these &quot;legs&quot;.  Instead of you using your muscles to push the pedal down, each of these &quot;legs&quot; in the engine is attached to a little chamber where fuel and air are mixed up then exploded.  That explosion makes the leg come down and turn the crankshaft, just like your leg pushes the pedal.</p>
<p>The liters, cubic inches, cubic centimetres, etc.  refer to how big those explosion chambers would be if you added them all up.</p>
<p>So a 4 cylinder 2 liter engine has four &quot;explosion chambers&quot; that, but together, would hold a carton of milk (2L).</p>
<p>All else being equal, bigger chambers allow for bigger explosions, and more powerful pedal pushes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of an engine as an air pump. That’s the amount of air pumped through every time the engine cycles. </p>
<p>That’s because the liters listed is the sum of the volumes of space traversed by the pistons as they go up and down. </p>
<p>If you had an imaginary 1 cylinder 1.0 Liter engine, the piston would be about the size of a liter bottle and would move up and down about as much as the liter bottle is tall.</p>
<p>(Edit; thanks to u/RedFiveIron for teaching me that air isn’t cycling through each rotation of a four stroke engine. I changed my description to “cycles” instead of “rotates”)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the top answers are close but not accurate.  The displacement is not the total volume of the cylinder or combustion chamber (then multiplied by number of cylinders), but rather it is the difference in volume between the combustion chamber at it's largest (piston furthest from the cylinder head) and at its smallest (piston as close to the cylinder head as it goes in that engine).  Even at its smallest, there is some volume in the cylinder, and that volume does not contribute to displacement.</p>
<p>So, essentially, it's a measure of how much the air/fuel mixture can expand when ignited (which is done at or close to the smallest size of the combustion chamber), which is why it is so closely related to output power, because that expansion driven by ignition is what produces the power in the first place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, it is a measurement of the volume of the cylinders where the exploding happens. </p>
<p>Displacement is used to approximate engine size and weight, and to a lesser extent &quot;power&quot;. It is worth noting, &quot; power&quot; is measured via torque, horsepower, and both of those things have a &quot;band&quot; where they change depending on the speed the engine is rotating at. Torque is the force generated by one cycle of the engine. Horsepower is the force applied by those cycles in a set period of time. As a certain speed, the engine will make more of either of those, and that is peak HP/torque. This is what is advertised, but it is misleading as peak horsepower (or torque) happens a small percentage of the time, and really doesn't mean much of anything for acceleration or towing. A small engine can be tuned for over 800 horsepower (where a similar engine commonly produces 150-200), but it won't be much use to a normal driver, because that engine's power curve is basically flat except for a massive spike, which you won't exploit much, or at all. </p>
<p>Basically engine power = displacement + tuning + induction (turbo or superchargers) + general design (unobstructed intake &amp; exhaust, good placement of the valves and such).</p>
<p>Edit: this doesn't include edge cases, like old carbeurated engines being inefficient, rotary engines being amazing, or CVT transmissions actually being used right.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
