<ol>
<li>&quot;The highest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest&quot;</li>

<li>&quot;The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars...&quot;</li>

<p>What is the base of a mountain and where is it? Are the bases of all mountains level at 0m? What about Mauna Kea? What is the equivalent level for mountains on other planets and on moons? What do you call the region or volume between the base and peak?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a little outside my field, but let me try to give you my understanding. The height of mountains is generally measured in one of two ways, topographic prominence (the height difference of the peak and the lowest contour line encircling it, but not containing a higher peak), or elevation above Earth's reference geoid (a mathematical model of the earth's shape, roughly the mean sea level in the absence of tides).</p>
<p>Using these definitions, let's clarify the statements on Wikipedia.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The highest mountain <em>above the reference geoid</em> on Earth is Mount Everest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <del>bases</del> <em>lowest encircling contour line</em> of mountain islands are below sea level. Mauna Kea is the world's <del>tallest</del> <em>most prominent</em> mountain.</p>
</li>
<li>The highest known mountain <em>above any planet's respective reference geoid</em> <del>on any planet</del> in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think that answers the first four questions. As for the fifth, there is, to my knowledge, no word for the volume of a mountain. The volume of a mountain is sometimes considered when deciding when something is actually a mountain. This, of course, opens up a whole new definitional can of worms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One way to think about what you are asking is the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topographic_prominence" target="_blank">prominence</a>. To paraphrase, suppose you had to walk from the top of a mountain to the top of a higher mountain. What is the lowest elevation that you would be forced to cross walking from one mountain to another? The distance between that elevation and the summit of the mountain is the prominence. </p>
<p>A reason to use prominence is the problem of finding a spot to measure from. Do you measure from sea level? The lowest point on the surface of the earth (like the bottom of the Mariana Trench? The core of the earth?</p>
<p>There's one problem with prominence - you can't measure prominence for the tallest mountain on earth (Mount Everest) because there is no taller mountain to walk to. So, usually the height of Mount Everest is measured from sea level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great question. I asked my geography professor the same question years ago when the film <em>The Man Who Went Up a Hill and Down a Mountain</em> came out. There is no universally agreed definition for mountain as it differs so much culture to culture. The topography of a mountain is more scientifically pertinent than an agreed upon definition defining a mountain can be more politically motivated.</p>
<p>Imagine giant balls at the top of the mountain roll down, where land is flat enough so the balls rests is the base of the mountain. So for example a ball at the top of Mauna Kea should roll down into the ocean and under the sea whereas the same ball would not roll down as far from Mount Everest before coming to a valley or a plain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well imagine there would be no water on earth, the seafloor would just be land as well, right? That’s where Mauna Kea’s base starts. There’s whole mountain chains completely underwater that just aren’t tall enough to reach the surface.</p>
<p>This is also how I think of other planets, it’s just mountains and hills and valleys without the water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<li>The height of a mountain measured on earth is measured from sea level.</li>
<li>How &quot;tall&quot; a mountain is is a bit less precise, but usually it's how high (peak to base) the mountain is compared to the &quot;local relief&quot;, which would be the general &quot;base level&quot; of the area surrounding the mountain. Local relief is a useful concept, but not a very precise one. Mauna Kea is a volcanic island with its base on the ocean floor some 10,000 meters below the peak.</li>
<li>The height of Olympus Mons is measured from the plains surrounding it, some 26km below the peak.</li>
