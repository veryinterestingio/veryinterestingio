		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Critical Race Theory is the theory that most, if not all, aspects of modern society have racism baked in, which is why it’s been so hard to get rid of racism. </p>
<p>For example, we tend to assume that our laws are written to be race-neutral, but critical race theorists point to the fact that people from different racial backgrounds can have wildly different outcomes while dealing with similar legal issues in the same legal system. The explanation, according to CRT, is that the laws and legal system are actually designed (consciously or not) to perpetuate racism. </p>
<p>It’s important to note that CRT isn’t really one theory, but rather is a collection of different ideas that challenge a wide swath of intellectual and political traditions. The common thread is that they all agree that race is one of the important factors in creating and maintaining inequalities in society.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a legal theory that arose in the 1980s with two core principals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>White supremacy exists in the US and exhibits power maintained over time, and, in particular, that the law plays a role in this process.</p>
<p>Transforming the relationship between law and racial power, as well as achieving racial emancipation and anti-subordination more broadly, are possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The supporters of this theory were reflecting on the effects of the 1968 Civil rights act, which seemed to have not completely eliminated racism in the US. Some lawyers in the 80s saw black civil rights as a &quot;legally solved&quot; problem, implying more application of existing laws was the answer to racism. The CRT folks disagreed.</p>
<p>As a result of CRT, the lawyers that support it argue for things like special treatment for minority races in laws. This leads to black empowerment zones and provisions in pot legalization statutes that favor minority communities in licensing to compensate for disproportionate incarceration for pot crimes.</p>
<p>The opposition is that fixing white supremacy with black preferences is the &quot;two wrongs make a right&quot; sort of thing that the Law disapproves of, in general. While the concept of rules that shift to get a desired outcome is common in ordinary life, the legal community likes to consider the law permanent and unchanging perfection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
