These separate 'balls' of protein suspended as a colloid in the waterborne medium of the egg acts as a liquid.  When heated, they no longer fold in on themselves and form a mat of crosslinked polymers which acts as a solid.  It is not a phase-change, like melting or freezing is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Physical change</strong> vs <strong>Chemical change</strong></p>
<p>Most <strong>pure substances</strong> like water, oxygen, iron, etc. will go through <strong>physical</strong> changes when heat is changed.  At low temps they will be solid, and high temps they will be a gas.  This process is reversible as well, as seen with the water cycle of rain and snow.</p>
<p><strong>Mixtures</strong>, like the complex fats and proteins of an egg, or sugar being cooked with air in the kitchen, will react at high temps and <strong>chemically change</strong> to form a new compound.  These will usually reduce to more stable states, so typically the end result will be a gas escaping and a solid that is more dense and stays solid at higher temps, but not always.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you cook an egg, you're breaking down and forming new bonds within the yolk. It's not <em>just heat</em>; the heat creates a chemical reaction within the yolk. </p>
<p>When you melt cheese or butter, it is just heat. You're just increasing entropy so the molecules want to move around faster, but the molecules don't change fundamentally. They don't have anything to react with. </p>
<p>So answer the general question of why some substances melt or solidify: it has to do with whether the contents are chemically reactive or stable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All right I guess I’ll have to comment because no one here has given a really clear explanation as to what is going on. </p>
<p>So basically you have the right idea that as thing a get hotter they melt, and as things get colder they freeze. It’s a good rule of thumb to go by, but when it comes to living in a world where everything is basically a complex mix of chemicals things get complicated.</p>
<p>The whole cold=freeze and hot=melt thing pretty much only holds true 100% of the time for pure elements like hydrogen, helium, iron etc </p>
<p>In your day to day life you rarely are dealing with pure elements. This holds especially true for things like food that are basically just huge collections of thousands of different chemicals and molecules interacting with each other all in different ways. </p>
<p>Now we can get to your egg question. Basically if there was some magical “egg” element then yes, you could heat it to melt, and then cool it to make solid egg whites. But there is no egg element. Eggs are just a shit ton of proteins and like other people have stated before if you hear a protein it basically unfolds. Egg whites turn white because the proteins in there unfold and get all tangled with each other. You could almost think of getting a bunch of ropes, putting them in a dryer, letting them all get knotted up in there, and then me handing them to you and tell you to undo all the knots just by pulling on the clump. More complicated than that but get the gist. </p>
<p>Because different things are made of different collections of molecules they will behave different when heated or cooled based not only on the molecules that make up the thing you’re cooking, but also the purity of said substance. Aka is the thing you’re cooking made of almost entirely one type or kind of molecule? Or are there other things mixed in and how much? These things can change how the material or substance will behave under different temperatures. </p>
<p>Let me know if you have any questions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
