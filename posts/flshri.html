		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some rocks are igneous (made in the earth's core). Some rocks are sedimentary (made from stuff on the surface, like sand or mud piling up.)</p>
<p>Igneous rock doesn't preserve fossils, because it originated as crazy hot magma at the center of the earth. There are no animals where igneous rock is made, and if their were, their skeletons would burn up anyway. Granite and Basalt are igneous rocks.</p>
<p>Sedimentary rock does preserve fossils, because plants and animals get trapped in the sand or mud, and if conditions are right, they will get preserved. Certain types of sedimentary rock, like shale, limestone, and sandstone, are the best at preserving fossils. Paleontologists look in those rocks first.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The earth is always piling new layers of stuff on top of old layers. If nothing moved around, then you’d have to dig reeeeeally far down to the layers from when those fossilized critters and plants existed. </p>
<p>But everything moves around! Rivers, mountains, continents—stuff is always shuffling around very slowly, but if you wait a long time, this leads to big changes. Because of this, the really old layers with fossils sometimes get exposed or moved to the surface. If you go to the Grand Canyon, for example, you can see the different layers in the cliff sides. All these layers together are called the “stratigraphic record.”</p>
<p>Geologists and paleontologists learn how to ‘read’ these different layers based on the kind of rocks you typically find in them. They’re also good at figuring out how different kinds of rocks are made and what they look like. Some rocks are made from old lava, others from old mud or sand, and so on. If a dinosaur died a long time ago and its bones became stuck in mud, you just might find these bones in one of those rocks that used to be mud. </p>
<p>In fact, some rocks are partly made of layers and layers of seashells and shrimp-like things and other critters that died a long time ago on an ocean floor and all clumped together. Some of these are now fossils!</p>
<p>So, if you want to find a fossil, then go (or dig) to a place where you can get to the layer with fossils, find the kind of rocks made of the right kind of stuff, and just keep breaking rocks until you find fossils.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Experience and persistence.</p>
<p>Not all rocks will have fossils, so you can eliminate vast areas right off the bat. Once you find the right type of rock (sedimentary rocks, shale is probably the absolute best) you just gotta start cracking rocks.</p>
<p>Some rocks like chalk (calcareous limestone) are pretty much all fossil. Just tons of little shells crushed together to form a rock.</p>
<p>Other rocks like shale are just mud that has been turned into rock. If a dead plant or animal is encased in mud, it stays pretty safe and can fossilize over time.</p>
<p>Depending on where you are, there are amazingly easy places to find fossils probably pretty close to you. And nothing is better than taking a kid out there and breaking open a rock or two and then showing them something that has been hidden for a hundred million years. It will blow their minds</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

If you look behind him you would see he has constructed a 16 room mansion from rocks that did not contain fossils</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
