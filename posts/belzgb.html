		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In dogs the generally accepted explanation is that they have a &quot;scent memory&quot; and when a scent is matched they will feel safer and more comfortable with that other dog. This means that dogs will remember their parents and siblings but not in the same way as humans. Dogs just have a list of dog smells they like and get along with.  You can read more about it here:</p>

<p>Not much research has been done in other animals but for the most part social animals will react the same way as dogs and non social animals have no concept of siblings or parents.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In domestic felines, it’s documented that daughters may share or overlap territories with the mother. Some even share a nest. This to me shows they do recognize one another, as outsiders are generally not tolerated.  How much they tolerate one another varies, but they do tend to tolerate familiar cats more. It’s not really proven yet if cats with similar DNA tend to get along better, but it’s been suggested.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Elephants are known to have strong recognition skills. They can remember other members of the group that aren't relatives.</p>
<p>Heck, they even remember the graves of other Elephants that they never even met. They have great memories and a strong sense of family/extended family groups.</p>
<p>Ethologist Cynthia Moss described a sad incident in which elephants showed a huge familiar bond with another elephant:</p>
<p>&quot;Two members of the family were shot by poachers, who were subsequently chased off by the remaining elephants. Although one of the elephants died, the other, named Tina, remained standing, but with knees beginning to give way. Two family members, Trista and Teresia (Tina's mother), walked to both sides of Tina and leaned in to hold her up. Eventually, Tina grew so weak, she fell to the ground and died. However, Trista and Teresia did not give up but continually tried to lift her. They managed to get Tina into a sitting position, but her body was lifeless and fell to the ground again. As the other elephant family members became more intensely involved in the aid, they tried to put grass into Tina's mouth. Teresia then put her tusks beneath Tina's head and front quarters and proceeded to lift her. As she did so, her right tusk broke completely off, right up to the lip and nerve cavity. The elephants gave up trying to lift Tina but did not leave her; instead, they began to bury her in a shallow grave and throw leaves over her body. They stood over Tina for the night and then began to leave in the morning. The last to leave was Teresia.&quot;

<p>Many fish on the other hand typically have little to no familial recognition. Many species will gladly eat their own eggs or young. Some species such as the Ancistrus variety will deliberately eat the eggs of rival males.</p>
