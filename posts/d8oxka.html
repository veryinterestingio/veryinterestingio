	<title>ELI5: If I cut something into 3 equal pieces, there are 3 defined pieces. But, 1÷3= .333333~. Why is the math a nonstop repeating decimal when existence allows 3 pieces? Is the assumption that it's physically impossible to cut something into 3 perfectly even pieces?</title>

<li>The problem isn't math.</li>
<li>The problem isn't the laws of nature either.</li>
<li>It's just a quirk of the number system we invented. </li>
<li>Imagine this:
<ul>
<li>You have 10 marbles.</li>
<li>Using all 10 marbles, make three equal groups.</li>
<li>You can't since if you did three groups of three you still have a marble left over.</li>
<li>Now imagine each marble is made up of 10 smaller marbles stuck together. </li>
<li>Now try it again. You still can't do it because you'd still have one of those smaller marbles left over.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Now image you had 9 marbles instead. </li>
<li>You can easily split those up in to three equal groups. </li>
<li>But what if you had to split them into two groups?</li>
<li>You can't because you'd still have a marble left over. 
<ul>
<li>What if each marble was really a group of 9 marbles stuck together that could be broken apart?</li>
<li>You still have the same issue of a marble left over.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>With any number system (Base 10, Base 9, Base Whatever) you're going to run into numbers that are hard to represent cleanly</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The fact that 1/3 is a repeating decimal is an artifact of the completely arbitrary base 10 system we use to represent numbers, and has nothing to do with physical reality. If we used base 9 instead of base 10, 1/3 could just be written as 0.3, while 1/2 would be written as the infinitely repeating decimal 0.444....</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Math is not reality, it's just a <em>description</em> of reality.</strong> You can cut your Thing into three perfectly equal pieces, and then describe each piece as:</p>
<ul>
<li>1/3</li>
<li>.33...</li>
<li>1 ÷ 3</li>
</ul>
<p>...and no matter which description you pick, it doesn’t change the Thing. If you choose .33... then you’re picking a description which is an infinite repeating series. If you pick 1/3 then you’re picking a fraction which is a perfectly even piece of a whole. Either way, your Thing was still cut into three equal pieces, and no description will change that. </p>
<p>You could even describe each piece as 1, and all three together as 3 - that wouldn’t mean that your Thing has tripled from its original size! It just means you’ve changed the way you’re describing reality.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
