		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The soil has pockets where the plant grew. You're not supposed to pat down the soil because these little pockets act as easy areas for plants to grow so they dont meet resistance. The plant grew around these little pockets. It's like filling a glass vase with rocks and then sand. The sand doesnt cause the rocks to rise because it's just going around the cracks of the rocks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I just wanted to add that volume doesn't tell you how much stuff is there, since stuff can be squeezed or sifted to make different volumes.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Soil is made up of a three phase system:</p>
<ol>
<li>Volume of air</li>
<li>Volume of solids</li>
<li>Volume of water</li>
</ol>
<p>Together, the volume of air and volume of water are called the volume of voids. As the plant grows, the roots begin to enter the volume of voids in the soil. These are like small pockets of space that can be filled with air, water or in this case now the roots. </p>
<p>The volume of solids is the soil itself which stays essentially constant. The nutrients extracted by the plant arenâ€™t depleting the volume of solids appreciably. </p>
<p>The volume of water fluctuates due to how often you water your plant. As the water dries out by way of evaporation, or is absorbed by the plant, this creates more empty void space to be filled again with water or allow the roots to continue growing. </p>
<p>This is why it is important not to densely pack your potting soil when you plant a new plant. You want loosely packed soil with plenty of void spaces to allow for the water to penetrate the soil and space for the plant roots to grow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
