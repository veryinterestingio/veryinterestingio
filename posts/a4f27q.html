<li>
<p>The medium: they are going to be viewed on is different. A movie screen is substantially different than a tv screen and a different aspect ratio. This requires higher quality picture</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>time: they have more time and funding  to complete their task. Cartoons made weekly or biweekly have a tight schedule, a lot of corners are cut to expedite production to meet deadlines.  </p>
</li>
<li>Funding: the source of income for a movie is ticket sales, the source of funding for a show is however much a studio appropriates depending on how much they can get for commercial time. Films in theaters tend to make money best when quality is high and quality cost money. Shows require new content, people want to ‘tune in’ to the newest episode that’s good for selling commercials. So cranking out new episodes is more important than quality.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was an animator for a studio that made tv series. The colors are decided by a process known as color scripting. In a movie, a lot of attention is paid to the color script and it can take weeks and maybe months to finalize all the colors for a movie. No corners are cut, no limits for fancy lighting setups, and we take all the time we need to make it perfect and amazing. In a tv show, because there are so many episodes and so little time, the color scripting is done extremely quickly, and we have to find economical ways to get these colors without adding too much to the workload of the animators, background artists and compositors (the person who puts all the elements together in the end and does post production). If you try to do something fancy, the workload gets compounded throughout the pipeline so you really can't deviate too far from the base colors unless you can find a way to do it quickly, which really limits the techniques you can use.</p>
<p>This of course depends a lot on the style of the show. The last series i animated in had gorgeous colors and lighting because the style was kept simple enough that more attention could be made to the colors. But I also animated in a series where there was no color change at all, everyone was always in their base colors, and it was fine because it was more about the animation and writing. It's the choice of the director how much work he wants to put into the colors and whether or not it added enough to the show to justify the man hours it would add. Spongebob and Hey Arnold's style and writing was enough to carry the show without the need to go all fancy for the colors, so they didn't.</p>
<p>tl;dr It takes a lot of time and a lot of skill to make great colors, and while movie productions can afford it, tv series have much more limiting time and budget constraints</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
