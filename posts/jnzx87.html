		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your nose fights off stinky germs, while your mouth is happy to have them over for dinner.  </p>
<p>EL you're in middle school version:  </p>
<p>Your respiratory tract is full of mucus, which has antimicrobial properties. The whole setup of hair, mucus, and cilia is our evolutionary response to containing/eliminating microbial threats in this part of the body.  </p>
<p>Then, we have the mouth. Here, we do a whole lot to make bacteria happy. We feed them and give them places to live, so they pay us back by producing bad-smelling waste (among other things). We fight these specifically by brushing/flossing our teeth, using mouthwash, reducing sugar intake, and seeing a dentist regularly. </p>
<p>Edit: Some have pointed out that our mind &quot;filters&quot; out the smell of our nose and the respiratory tract in general. This is true, but breath leaving your nose should not have an offensive smell. If you or an observer notices a stink coming out of your nose, it's likely due to an infection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is the smell lives in your mouth and not your lungs. The smell is actually from decaying food and whatnot. That decaying food also is what causes cavities/caries. So unless you start eating with your nose you shouldn’t have to worry about bad nose breath.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your mouth is filled with millions of harmless bacteria which eat food particles left in your mouth and expel smelly gases as a byproduct. Your nasal passage is mostly bacteria free.</p>
<p>It also comes down to desensitization. Much like your nose always being in your vision. Your brain tunes of the smell of your nasal cavity naturally so it can do it's job.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd guess it's the difference between what's in your mouth and what's in your nose.</p>
<p>I had a temporary crown removed today - not sure if it was that I couldn't properly clean around it or what (I normally have pretty good oral hygiene), but it reeked. Nasty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
