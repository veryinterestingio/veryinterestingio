		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually I rely on more qualified posters, but this thread is thin enough that my input may be the best.</p>
<p>Memory is all about encoding and retrieval </p>
<p>Your youngest memories are encoded in the blank of your young mind, and everything else gets coded into the available space that’s left.</p>
<p>That’s not for long, because there’s so much to remember. Memories get chopped up and categorized among other similar memories.</p>
<p>Your retrieval process changes into associating like memories with other ones. The initial memories you make are super strong and serve as a basis to how you associate what with what. </p>
<p>That can, of course, change over time; but the youngest standing memories seem to be the most clear-cut unassociated ones that withstand the chopping that occurs over time.</p>
<p>The memories you form in later life are sort of compressed by encoding them according to what you’ve already experienced, and only adding extra details, regarding what’s new. It’s less novel, and it doesn’t get as much priority to be ‘declarative.’ </p>
<p>On the flip, many of the childhood memories you don’t remember are ‘implicit.’ They’re there, but you can’t just think to remember them.</p>
<p>There’s that sweet spot, where everything that was happing to you was novel, and your brain was able to remember them ‘declaratively.’</p>
<p>Be happy that your memory isn’t a run-on declarative documentation of every little thing that’s happened. It may seem like you’ve forgotten everything, but it’s usually all in there, waiting for a trigger to find the associations that lead to the retrieval of relevant memories.</p>
<p>Declarative means you can think and retrieve it</p>
<p>Implicit means it’s there, but you can’t think to retrieve it</p>
<p>Association is how you can trigger retrieval, by being reminded of something encoded</p>
<p>These are probably out-dated Psy terms by now, but there wasn’t anything else in the thread that spoke to human memory.</p>
<p>If you can swing it: note what you see in your memorable dreams. You can see various parts of your associative memory in terms of declarative re-experience. That’s when your mind is going through saved files in your brain. That’s when you can clearly relive those midlife memories.</p>
<p>No: I’m not selling anything. Dreaming is literally the best way to comb your memories. When you’re awake, it’s new experiences that awaken encoded memories. New associations connect to previous memories. The random fire of sleep is the major process that reminds us of literally everything we have ever known.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The initial memory you made didn't have many links because you had less experiences. It was new so your brain made a note and now it's the main thing the brain uses when recognising new situations. It makes a smaller note of those things, linking key components of experiences. The initial one had the most new unrecognised information so the most information was stored. But different parts of the information have now been linked to different bits of information. The links within the first experience havent been used in a long time so it has been split up, meaning you remember these snippets of what happened and you remember them in lots of situations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The brain is like a net: lots of interconnected nodes. When a memory is formed, a specific combination of nodes are activated. Every time the same combination is activated (i.e. memorizing or remembering), the connections between them grow stronger, making the memory easier to remember in the future. </p>
<p>Over time however the connections may degrade, causing gradual forgetting. Connections between nodes may dissolve completely, resulting in disjointed memories (i.e. you remember doing something, but not why you did it or what happens after that). </p>
<p>Each node may serve as an intermediary for more than one memory. Therefore, strengthening one memory may also unintentionally strengthen neighbouring memories which share common nodes. Those random, pointless memories of your earlier childhood may be associated to some more important recent memories, even though you may not be conscious of exactly how they are related.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
