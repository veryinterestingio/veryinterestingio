<p>Many Gnostics believed that Jesus was sent to earth to bring this special knowledge, but most early Christians didn’t think Gnostics were true Christians.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gnosticism is a religious movement from the first couple centuries AD/CE. It is a more spiritual and mystical belief rather than one of rules and authority—Judaism and Christianity are more rule orientated. Gnostics recognize Jesus as an important figure, but did not agree if Jesus was part of god or a man. Also, they have a Zoroastrian influence in that they have two gods, one good and one evil.</p>
<p>The early Christian Church declared this belief a heresy. Gnosticism eventually evolved in Manicheism, another Christian heresy.</p>
<p>EDIT: As an additional historical tidbit, the Cathars/Albigensians in southern France were a Gnostic movement. Early in the 13th Century, Pope Innocent III started a twenty-year long Crusade against them killing between 200,000 to a million. It was the single largest of the Crusades, and it took place France. It was during this crusade where the famous expression &quot;kill them all, and let God sort them out,&quot; came from. (The exact quote is <em>Caedite eos. Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius.</em>—Kill them. For the Lord knows those that are His own.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gnosticism was this weird fusion between christian/jewish mysticism and neoplatonic philosophy, and it's roots lie in the religious question &quot;If God is good, why is there evil in the universe?&quot;</p>
<p>And the gnostic answer was that the universe isn't Gods creation. In gnosticism the physical universe is a prison/illusion, a creation by the demiurge (the maker) a lower divine or semi-divine being who created an imperfect physical universe. In gnosticism salvation was not due to sin or repentance, but knowledge (gnosis). By knowing God your soul could escape the imperfect universe and reach paradise.</p>
<p>Most gnostic sects believed that Jesus was a messenger of the true god, and through his esoteric (secret/hidden) teachings you could gain knowledge of God and achieve salvation. Other sects believed that John the Baptist was the true messenger and Jesus the false one, one created by the demiurge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
