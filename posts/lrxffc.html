		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends how big of weather you’re thinking. For radiation cooling on a clear night just a small pond can form fog since water stays warm longer, the temp difference can cause water vapor to condense. On a larger scale like thunderstorms you need enough water to saturate the air which takes a massive amount of evaporation. In warm air, it’d have to be something at least as big as lake mead in nevada</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's a &quot;butterfly flaps its wings&quot; sort of question that can't truly be answered.  One little pond won't affect weather patterns but a bunch of ponds will.  For example, there was a big building boom in Las Vegas and a bunch of swimming pools were built.  The result was that the humidity it Las Vegas increased significantly because of the evaporation from the newly built swimming pools.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually have personal, if not professional, experience with this, as I live next to the largest lake (completely) in Colorado, the manmade <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mesa_Reservoir" target="_blank">Blue Mesa Reservoir.</a></p>
<p>Anecdotally, the building of the reservoir caused a significant cooling effect in the nearby town of Gunnison, generally believed to be caused by blocking the traditional venting path for descending cold air coming down the various side-valleys. The result, once again anecdotally because I can't for the life of me find ANY weather impact studies on Colorado reservoirs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_River_Storage_Project#Environmental_Impact" target="_blank">(there's plenty of stuff about the damage to the river systems though)</a>. Anyway,  THE RESULT according to the old timers is a dryer, colder up-river valley where all the pooled cold and dry air sits until the sun heats it enough to escape upwards, or until the afternoon/evening winds come up-river and stir things up a bit.</p>
<p>Basically, a large body of water can disrupt local air currents by creating an area that has a different heat capacity and reflection/absorption factor that the surrounding area, and after that's it's all chaos-theory or whatever term the modern meteorologists use. </p>
<p>As a final note(s), if you want to look into how the land/water/wind interaction works, there are tons of scholarly and layman articles about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_breeze" target="_blank">Sea Breezes</a>, which is an excellent starting point on the topic. And if you really want to get your teeth into the subject, consider visiting the <a href="https://www.usbr.gov/library/index.html" target="_blank">Bureau of Reclamation's Library</a>. Despite the name, they're the folks who manage most of the water in the more-federal states west of the Mississippi river, and honestly have some absolutely amazing people working for them (their project-testing building is like a cross between a water park, a science museum, and a factory, it was great wandering it though it on my lunch breaks back when I contracted there).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like others have answered a fair amount of your question.  I would like to add that other man-made things affect weather and related phenomena.  For example, extremely large solar farms can actually increase local humidity which can cause surrounding desert areas to become semi-arid.  Likewise, large amounts of asphalt can cause the temperature to be warmer in the area later in the evening (as heat is released after sunset, since the asphalt was absorbing heat from the sun all day) -- called the urban heat island effect.</p>
<p>On the flip side, and more toward the idea of man-made bodies of water, we have retention ponds, which can help limit flooding, and dams, which affect flooding, land and water habitats, and can affect things like downstream water temperatures.  I am not sure these necessarily affect local weather patterns in the sense of affecting rainfall or average temperature more than a short distance away from the body of water, with a potential exception for very large dams -- like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Gorges_Dam" target="_blank">Three Gorges Dam</a> in China -- that control much more upstream and downstream water than most dams do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
