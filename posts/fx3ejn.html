<p>These reservoirs are a major focus of investigation for the medical community, as they provide a point of reinfection for the human population, even if we were to eliminate the circulating virus in our own population. </p>

<p>&quot;<strong>Lesson 1: Introduction to Epidemiology<br />
Section 10: Chain of Infection</strong></p>
<p>As described above, the traditional epidemiologic triad model holds that infectious diseases result from the interaction of agent, host, and environment. More specifically, transmission occurs when the agent leaves its <strong>reservoir</strong> or host through a <strong>portal of exit</strong>, is conveyed by some <strong>mode of transmission</strong>, and enters through an appropriate <strong>portal of entry</strong> to infect a <strong>susceptible host</strong>. This sequence is sometimes called the chain of infection.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Reservoir</strong><br />
The reservoir of an infectious agent is the habitat in which the agent normally lives, grows, and multiplies. Reservoirs include humans, animals, and the environment. The reservoir may or may not be the source from which an agent is transferred to a host. For example, the reservoir of Clostridium botulinum is soil, but the source of most botulism infections is improperly canned food containing C. botulinum spores.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Human reservoirs.</strong> Many common infectious diseases have human reservoirs. Diseases that are transmitted from person to person without intermediaries include the sexually transmitted diseases, measles, mumps, streptococcal infection, and many respiratory pathogens.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Animal reservoirs.</strong> Humans are also subject to diseases that have animal reservoirs. Many of these diseases are transmitted from animal to animal, with humans as incidental hosts. The term <strong>zoonosis</strong> refers to an infectious disease that is transmissible under natural conditions from vertebrate animals to humans. Long recognized zoonotic diseases include brucellosis (cows and pigs), anthrax (sheep), plague (rodents), trichinellosis/trichinosis (swine), tularemia (rabbits), and rabies (bats, raccoons, dogs, and other mammals). Zoonoses newly emergent in North America include West Nile encephalitis (birds), and monkeypox (prairie dogs). Many newly recognized infectious diseases in humans, including HIV/AIDS, Ebola infection and SARS, are thought to have emerged from animal hosts, although those hosts have not yet been identified.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Environmental reservoirs.</strong> Plants, soil, and water in the environment are also reservoirs for some infectious agents. Many fungal agents, such as those that cause histoplasmosis, live and multiply in the soil. Outbreaks of Legionnaires disease are often traced to water supplies in cooling towers and evaporative condensers, reservoirs for the causative organism Legionella pneumophila.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For that to work it would rely on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having a short enough incubation/transmission lifetime so that every infection becomes known during the lockdown. If something can be dormant for 14 days, then in a house of 3 people you could potentially have someone catch it right before they go in, transmit it to another person on the 14th day, then they transmit it to the 3rd person on their 14th day (28th overall) and then you're right at the end of your month isolation with a freshly infected case. That's expected to happen <em>somewhere</em> because there would be so many houses with multiple people.</li>
<li>Every case being 'cured' (fought off by the immune system) in that time or at least obvious enough for additional isolation and <em>not</em> becoming dormant in some carrier person.</li>
<li>The flu dies off on any outside surfaces etc.</li>
<li>No other outside animals can carry it and put it right back into humanity when lockdown is over</li>
<li>Everybody is actually in full lockdown - so how do garbage bins get picked up? How are power plant operations controlled? How do people get groceries?</li>
<li>How do you get everybody on board? You need co-operation to a point that is effectively impossible.</li>
<li>What happens when a flu evolves back from another animal, like 2003-SARS and the current covid? Your lockdown can hypothetically knock off things in humans, but won't prevent future mutations crossing species.</li>
