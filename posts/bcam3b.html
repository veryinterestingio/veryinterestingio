<p>Whether they do or not is going to be tricky to discover, because ten kilometers can look like an awful lot of nothing in space. To put it in perspective, our own moon could have such a submoon, and we might never know of it, depending on exactly how it orbits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Theres likely infinite theoretical levels which are would be related to the relative masses of the various bodies and their distances from each parent/grandparent/greatgrandparent body.</p>
<p>If you have a satellite and want it to orbit the moon then considering the forces on the satellite.</p>
<p>MoonGravForce &gt;&gt; EarthGravForce</p>
<p>Basically the satellite must be practically influenced only by the moon, with a tiny or even negligible force due to the earths gravity. To achieve this then the satellite must be much closer to the moon than to the earth even at its closest point in orbit.
Distance to Earth &gt;&gt; Distance to Moon</p>
<p>This can be applied to any number of levels within a solar system so long as there is enough distance in the orbits. There is probably a hard limit due to factors like the limit of planet size and the limit of sun size and how they relate to the definitions of a solar system, a sun and a planet.
Its also likely that the smaller an object becomes, the less stable its orbit will be. As small perturbations can have a larger relative effect on a smaller mass.
A high level system will decay far more quickly, which is supported by the tendency of the universe to become more chaotic or to tend towards equilibrium.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, in theory. However, the <em>moonmoon</em> (or <em>submoon</em>, if you prefer) must be very small (in the order of 10's of km in diameter) around a much larger moon (in the order of 1,000's of km in diameter), and the moon must be relatively far from the host planet (otherwise the <em>moonmoon</em> would be captured by the planet's gravity directly). Also, these are highly dynamic systems, and so don't tend to stick around very long (though on the timescale of celestial mechanics, a &quot;couple million years&quot; is still considered &quot;short&quot;).</p>
<p>The abstract of the paper on the subject (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03304.pdf" target="_blank">Can Moons Have Moons</a> by Kollmeier &amp; Raymond (2019)):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each of the giant planets within the Solar System has large moons butnone ofthese moons have their own moons (which we call <em>submoons</em>). By analogy with studies of moons around short-period exoplanets, we investigate the tidal-dynamical stability of submoons. We find that 10 km-scale submoons can only survive around large (1000km-scale) moons on wide-separation orbits. Tidal dissipation destabilizes the orbits of submoons around moons that are small or too close to their host planet; this is the case for most of the Solar System’s moons. A handful of known moons are, however, capable of hosting long-lived submoons: Saturn’s moons Titan and Iapetus, Jupiter’s moon Callisto, and Earth’s Moon. Based on its inferred mass and orbital separation, the newly-discovered exomoon candidate Kepler-1625b-I can in principle host a large submoon, although its stability depends on a number of unknown parameters. We discuss the possible habitability of submoons and the potential for subsubmoons. The existence, or lack thereof, of submoons, may yield important constraints on satellite formation and evolution in planetary systems</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. In the exact same way a star has planets and a planet has moons. This can continue, a moon having submoons, submoons have subsubmoons, etc. until the other 3 fundamental forces (strong, weak, electromagnetism) start to have stronger effects as compared to gravity.</p>
<p>But then again, aren't electrons &quot;orbiting&quot; a nucleus really just subsubsubsubsubsub...moons orbiting a subsubsubsub...moon?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
