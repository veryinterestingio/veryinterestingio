		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To an extent yes. In a practical sense no. Fire is a self sustaining reaction meaning that it creates enough energy to keep itself on fire. The idea behind using water to put it out (in something like a house fire when it isn’t practical to smother it) is that the energy that is sustaining the reaction is instead utilized to heat and then vaporize the water. That means energy goes into creating steam rather than creating more fire. So in this instance it would take more energy to turn cold water into steam than hot water but phase change to steam (also known as the latent heat of vaporization) is actually the most energy intensive step in the process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but it's a small difference. Freezing-cold water takes only about 20% more energy to turn to steam than boiling-hot water. The bonds that keep water in liquid form take five times more energy to break than the energy it takes to heat water from 0° C to 100° C. A fire, burning at 600° C, can heat water and boil it away almost as quickly if it's cold. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In reality, no.  The amount of heat that water can absorb, in this case taking away from fire, as a liquid is at most 1/7 of the amount of heat that water can absorb once it reaches boiling temperature.  The amount of heat needed to turn liquid water into a vapor is much higher than the heat needed to bring slightly above freezing water to a boil.  This effect will basically suck the heat out of a fire, until it no longer has enough heat to continue.  There are two terms used for this phenomena:  sensible heat and latent heat.  Sensible heat is the amount of heat needed change the temperature of a body.  Latent heat is the amount of heat that a body needs to absorb or release in order to change the state of said body.  These processes work both ways.  A body can gain heat to increase it's temperature, or lose heat to lower it's temperature, gain heat to go from solid--&gt;liquid--&gt;gas or lose heat to go from gas--&gt;liquid--&gt;solid.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And for a real world example of this in action, and how it can save your life:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you are ever stuck in a fire such as a burning house/apartment, and the only way out is through the inferno, try to find a water source and a blanket/towel/etc.  Wet this stuff as much as you can and wrap it around your body.  This will allow you to sprint through the fire and heat safely and without being burned.  The amount of heat(and more importantly, time) that it takes the fire to heat up the water in the blanket until it boils off is much higher than what it has time to do in the moments you run through. Until that water can boil off, it will do most of the work of absorbing heat, instead of your body</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the principle behind this is the fire tetrahedron. That is that fire needs 4 things to continue: enough energy in the form of heat, oxygen, a fuel source, and the chemical reaction.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Water works by firstly and most importantly by removing the heat from the fire, thus removing its ability to maintain the temperature required for a sustained chain reaction.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Secondly, water at sufficient pressure can break apart the fuel, thus preventing the sustaining chain reaction from continuing onto more fuel.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Although temperature of the water, and thus the difference in temperature between the fire and the water, is important to the transfer of heat due to convection, changing the temperature of the warmer water by a hundred degrees (112 F water to 212 F water) is \~100 BTU/lbm. Changing the temperature of colder water by 170 degrees (40 F water to 212 F water) is \~170 BTU/lbm.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This may seem like a huge difference, but the amount of energy required to change 212 F water to 212 F steam is around 776 BTU/lbm.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So the net energy difference between 40 F water and 100 F water to change to the same temp steam is  876 BTU/lbm for 112 F water and 946 BTU/lbm for 40 F water. Not too much of a difference, but a difference nonetheless.</p>
<p>(all numbers are approximates as its been a while since I've looked into the info)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>As there seems to be some confusion on whether water removes oxygen from a fire, I will put some more amplifying information.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Water by itself in a liquid or a gaseous state cannot provide the type of smothering action that would be needed to remove the oxygen from the fuel source. The molecules themselves dont form any kind of barrier in any true sense. It might temporarily remove oxygen from a small portion of the fire, but it is unable to completely remove oxygen from the fuel source. This is why AFFF (Aqueous Film Forming Foam) is added to water if it is needed that oxygen is prevented from reaching the fuel (As well as the fuel vapors from contacting the oxygen in the air) in certain instances of oil / gasoline fires.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>CO2 and Halon systems are used when a fire needs to be smothered (removing oxygen from the fire tetrahedron) without damaging any sensitive or electrical equipment. This is especially used in large server farms and other large electrical buildings. CO2 and Halon gas are heavier than air and naturally settle to the bottom of any space and displace the oxygen from the fuel source. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>These two methods (AKA either a film around the fuel or the total displacement of air and oxygen) are the only reliable ways to prevent fire vapors and oxygen from interacting.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but with very little difference. Fire is sustained by fuel, oxygen, and heat. Water extinguishes fire by simultaneously removing heat from the fire and separate fuel &amp; oxygen. </p>
<p>Water absorbs sensible and latent heat from the fire which slow down the combustion process. Sensible heat is the amount of energy or heat that is required to change temperature of a substance, so lowering water temperature means more heat is removed from the fire to supply this heat transfer process. Latent heat is the amount of energy required to change state/phase of a substance, in this case liquid water evaporates to become steam. Latent heat is much greater than sensible heat simply because it requires a massive amount of energy to break or form intermolecular bonds than to simply accelerate molecules.  Therefore, temperature of water plays only a small role in this process of removing heat from the fire.</p>
<p>In addition, water is heavier than air and therefore sinks to the bottom of the fire and acts as a blanket to separate fuel and oxygen. This is the reason why water won’t have any any effects on grease fire as grease is lighter than water. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
