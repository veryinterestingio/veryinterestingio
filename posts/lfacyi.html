		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm Dr. Bechara Choucair and I'm the national vaccinations coordinator for the COVID-19 Response Team, focusing on coordinating the timely, safe, and equitable delivery of COVID-19 vaccinations for the U.S. population, in close partnership with relevant federal departments and agencies, as well as state and local authorities. I also leads our effort to administer 100 million vaccinations in the first 100 days. Before this, I was SVP and chief health officer at Kaiser Permanente and commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health before that.</p>
<p>I'm Carole Johnson and I'm the national testing coordinator for the COVID-19 Response Team. I previously served as the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Human Services, managing the state's largest agency including Medicaid, child care, food assistance, aging services, and mental health and substance use disorder treatment. For more than five years, I served in the Obama White House as senior health policy advisor and a member of the Domestic Policy Council health team working on Affordable Care Act implementation issues and public health challenges like Ebola and Zika. I also worked on Capitol Hill for members of three key health committees - Senate Finance, House Ways and Means, and Senate Aging - and in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Health Resources and Services Administration, the Alliance of Community Health Plans, the Pew Charitable Trusts, and the American Heart Association.</p>
<p>I'm Tim Manning and I'm the national supply chain coordinator for the COVID-19 Response Team. I'm an emergency manager, doing disaster and emergency response for the past 25 years; I've worked at the local and state level, and served in FEMA for eight years as a Deputy Administrator. I've been a firefighter and EMT, and I know first-hand the importance of having the equipment and supplies you need, when you need it on the front lines of a crisis. Right now, I work with teams across the government - from the Department of Defense to the Department of Health and Human Services - to ensure our country has the supplies we need, not just now but into the future too.</p>
<p>We will be joining you all at 5 PM ET (22 UT), AUA!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a computer programmer, when I hear about people having a hard time signing up for vaccines (and hear about vaccines going to waste because people sign up then no-show) my mind immediately says, &quot;a centralized, online sign-up database could solve this!&quot;</p>
<p>However, the answer never seems to be a Federal, centralized online database. Do you have any insight as to why technology seems to always be an afterthought for Federal programs and it is so often left up to the states?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in supply chains for batteries and we have to pay attention to all stages, from raw material acquisition, to manufacturing of each component, to assembly, transport, and distribution. If one step is broken, the whole process is delayed. What are the steps for vaccines (e.g., raw materials, glass vial and needle mfg, vaccine production, safe storage, giving the shots....)? Which parts are set up well and which ones are creating delays? And are you finding that industry is being helpful or wanting to talk control?</p>
<p>Thanks from a fellow systems person for all youâ€™re doing!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm CEO of an independent pharmacy in a major metropolitan area in the State of Florida.  We serve primarily minority HIV/AIDS patients (Many over the age of 65).  While we have been prepared to vaccinate over 1,000 of these patients for many months, we have been unable to procure ANY doses of vaccine for our patients.  Due to our high level of specialization (dealing with HIV/AIDS patients) we are not part of any of the &quot;Retail&quot; pharmacy groups the White House announced will be getting vaccine on the 11th.  How/When do we get vaccine for these patients??</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
