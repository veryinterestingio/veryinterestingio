He said to close your eyes, and visualize a black chalkboard in front of you. Now imagine drawing the letter A, and the wipe it off the board. Do the same with the letter B, and work your way through the alphabet.</p>
<p>Have been doing this for the past week, and I end up falling asleep within 10 minutes or so. Most of the time I trail off, thinking about something else, and come back to it, but the “trailing off” is my mind shutting down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Really as an adult we &quot;forget&quot; how to fall asleep. The trick really is to clear your mind and relax. This used to come naturally when you were younger, but now you have the stresses of being older which make it harder to relax and let go of.  </p>
<p>If it helps I have some tricks on how to get to sleep easier. The big trick I've found is you need to &quot;practice&quot; going to sleep. When you go and lie down in bed, don't do anything else. Don't lie there and reflect on the day's events, don't read a book, and certainly don't look at your phone or TV. Remove those from the room if possible. Get in the habit of bedtime is sleep only. If you lie down on your bed you only sleep. You have to be strict with yourself. Next is a sort of form of self hypnosis. When you lie down to go to bed, think of a trigger phrase. Something pleasant, but which you wouldn't say normally. Good night sweetie to yourself or something. Whatever it is just make sure it is unique and pleasant. This becomes a sort of hypnotic trigger which will tell your mind know you are trying to sleep. Finally relax. Flex and release your body muscles starting at your head and going all the way down to your toes. This will help you relax and fall asleep. Most important though, clear your mind, if you start thinking of something catch yourself and clear your mind again. Eventually this will become habit and you should be able to just fall right asleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
