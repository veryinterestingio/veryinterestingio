Even if you lose all your blood volume you’d still have some immunity from these cells (they make new immunoglobulin antibodies in the event of a fresh encounter with Covid-19, though different viruses trigger greater or lesser numbers of memory cells and coronaviruses in general elicit poor memory cell responses). Every time you give blood you lose a small  amount if your circulating immunoglobulins but these are lost over time anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plasma donations top out at 800ml (0.8L). You have <del>~5L</del>2.9L of plasma at any one time (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/plasma-volume" target="_blank">Source</a>).</p>
<p>On top of this, antibodies continue to be <a href="https://coronavirusexplained.ukri.org/en/article/vdt0006/" target="_blank">produced</a> post-infection, and last for some time afterwards. </p>
<p>Cytotoxicity (i.e. killing of cells) of virally infected cells is also mediated by NK cells and CD8+ T cells, both of which can kill without antibodies. T-cells also help maintain immunity post infection. </p>
<p>tl;dr: you should be fine</p>
<p>edit: fixed error</p>
<p>edit2: per the Red Cross website, a healthy person <del>can donate every two weeks</del>frequently (see other comments), therefore the rate at which your plasma is replaced is fairly quick</p>
<p>edit3: donation limits were per the australian red cross, I'm assuming they vary country to country. While I appreciate every American plasma donation center employee ever pointing out that it can be higher, you can stop commenting now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have way more antibodies typically than are necessary to fight off a rechallenge, at least initially, because you had way more virus during infection, and needed high amounts of antibodies for some to not slip through the cracks then. A new infection challenge is going to be far fewer virus particles and just get knocked out quickly by the more-than-needed antibody levels. </p>
<p>Here’s a paper where some researchers were just doing general COVID-19 antibody research. It looks like they were diluting 20x and still showing protection in cell cultures:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3298259/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3298259/</a></p>
<p>Per comments elsewhere, this is like mildly diluting your plasma for a short time. Not even 2x, much less 20x. </p>
<p>I know the vaccine makers test for a higher dilution. Can sino was diluting 40x and showing neutralization with their vaccine phase 1 candidate as an example:
<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31208-3/fulltext" target="_blank">https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31208-3/fulltext</a></p>
<p>There’s some very small chance you don’t have neutralizing antibodies. But taking plasma won’t matter either way in that case! </p>
<p>I’m not an immunologist but I have reading comprehension and a memory! Maybe an actual one could get more specific... but it seems like you’ll be fine, so go ahead and save some people’s lives!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have memory B cells encoding for the antibodies at that point, so you’re good.</p>
<p>Translation- your body stores the “code” it needs to make the immunologic weaponry it needs to fight off the virus, and will activate production into overdrive if re-exposed. This storage process lasts years if not a lifetime, so a donation will not put you at increased risk of complications from an infection.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The average adult has about 5600mL of blood in them and plasma makes up about 55% of it, being the largest component of human blood, which means you have around 3000mL of plasma in your body. Plasma donation can be up to 880mL and it can be done up to twice a week but not two days consecutively, which allows them to get the maximum amount of plasma while giving your body the time it needs to replace the plasma that’s missing, rehydrate and rest. Technically it takes anywhere from a few hours up to 48 hours after donating for plasma to regenerate and the body responds immediately by rebuilding missing antibodies so that immunity and future antibody levels aren’t affected. </p>
<p>Plasma, whether you donate because of covid19 or for other reasons, is an incredible thing. Your donation could be used to save thousands of lives and the process in which the donation is done is extremely interesting. They draw your blood, filter it so it’s free of any fatty cells, separate the plasma from the red blood cells and then return the red cells back to you. At the end they give you saline solution to help replace missing plasma and rehydrate so, for the most part, you leave feeling good (not overly tired, dizzy, etc) but it’s always a good idea to take some Gatorade or ask for one! Most plasma donation centers keep Gatorade or snacks on hand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
