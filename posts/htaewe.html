		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's because the human body doesn't filter individual things, rather it's more broad. An example:</p>
<p>Acidic things get neutralized by sodium bicarbonate. Alkaline things get neutralized by the stomach acid. Alcohol (-oh compounds) get broken down by alcohol dehydrogenase into aldehydes (-cho compounds). Aldehydes get broken down by aldehyde dehydrogenase into carboxylic acid (-cooh).</p>
<p>There are lots of enzymes and tools that the body can use to act on a given substance entering the body, without needing to &quot;identify&quot; the substance.</p>
<p>Edit: fixed alcohol functional group</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Seriously, enzymes make pretty much everything work in the body. Blood flows into the liver and certain enzymes will either start up regulating or metabolizing what’s in the blood. We talk about filtering and think about it in a certain way but irl in the body filters are more complex, enzymes make the magic happen. Things the body cannot break down will and do stick around in the body. This is why PPE is important in a lot of jobs. Somethings like heavy metals are reactive and will break enzymes essentially thus stopping their  ejection from the body. You can think of enzymes kinda like someone molding ball of clay. Where the hands are the enzymes and clay is the substance that needs to be changed so that it can the either molded to something useful or picked apart and discarded. You drink a beer, it’s broken down to something smaller like ethanol. That travels to the liver where certain enzymes break that down and process it into something safe ish that’s then exits the body in various places. Clearly it’s way more complicated than that but hope this is helpful. There you have it, the secret to life is enzymes idk probably 42 of them maybe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not. I work in a construction equipment repair shop, all the old guys I work with have liver problems from years of not wearing gloves. Chemicals like break clean soak in through your skin and can't be filtered by your liver so they just collect there and cause problems when you get old.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This will only partially answer your question but the permeability of the glomerulus of the nephron (the functional unit of the kidney) is responsible for the removal/excretion of many substances from the body. Desirable substances are selectively reabsorbed. The nephron is also the site of a large amount of protein catabolism. After small proteins pass through the glomerulus, most are reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubule and end up in lysosomes, where they are degraded.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: I forgot this is ELI5.</p>
<p>Short answer: You pee out small molecules and a part of your kidney sits there and goes, &quot;Wait, I need that&quot; and pulls important things back in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how sometimes you see something you don't recognize and you're like &quot;I don't know what that is, but it's definitely not a cat&quot;? Like, you know what a cat is, and even though you don't know what this <em>other</em> thing is, even though you might not know anything about it <em>at all...</em> you can still tell that it isn't a cat.</p>
<p>Well your body is sorta like that. It doesn't know how to identify all the millions of different things that might get into your body, it just knows the things that are <em>supposed</em> to be in your body, and anything that <em>isn't</em> that is bad.</p>
<p>But then, sometimes things can be really sneaky or really tiny and your body won't notice them get in, or maybe it looks <em>kinda</em> like a cat, so your body doesn't immediately recognize it as bad, and its only once it starts barking that your body is like &quot;whoa, that ain't no a cat.&quot; This is how you get sick.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
