		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is evidence that humans expanded to Europe as much as 150,000 years ago. Being so far north they would have less sunlight to worry about and would have adapted with lighter skin pigmentation.</p>
<p>Whereas humans expanded to north America only 20000 years ago by crossing the land bridge from Russia to Alaska. So they have had significantly less time to adapt to the conditions.</p>
<p>Native Americans also expanded from eastern Asian ancestors whereas Europeans expanded from western Asian/African ancestors. So there would have already been a big difference between the two populations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're also ignoring the fact that some native Americans are pretty light in skin tone. There's a genetic variant for light skin that is only found in native American and East Asian peoples.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have to remember that evolution is RANDOM. If you get exposed to a new environment, your descendants adapt by keeping WHICHEVER new randomly-mutated traits are beneficial.  IF one of those mutations is light skin, that’ll thrive. But that’s not necessarily a mutation that’ll happen. Mutations are random. Some are even detrimental.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Native North Americans came from Asia/Siberia some 12,000 years ago during the last ice age when glaciers over a mile high covered all but the west coast of North America and sea level was 400ft lower than it is today. </p>
<p>This connected Asia and Alaska as a solid land mass allowing migration of animal herds and the predators who feed on them, including people, between the two continents. </p>
<p>The initial genetic link between those two races is very old so they have divergent physical characteristics. We are talking 25 thousand years or more. It wasn’t until ~500 years ago that Europeans and Native Americans reintroduced themselves. It did not go well for the Indigenous population.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
