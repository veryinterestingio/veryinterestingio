		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Colds spread more in winter because people tend to stay inside in closer contact; they don't completely die out over the summer, there's just less people infected. When it gets cold out the infection rate increases, and everyone gets a cold again.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that plenty of countries are always cold, and that summer and winter are reversed between the North and South hemispheres. Even if colds did completely die out in summer there would still be people infected somewhere else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I live in a tropical country. There's no off season for the common cold here, and our winters are probably warmer than many countries' summers.</p>
<p>I doubt that even in you country during &quot;off season&quot; you have zero cases of common cold.</p>
<p>Off season only means there are less cases.</p>
<p>So it's still there, maybe in a reduced number of individuals, but still mutating and thriving.</p>
<p>Then even if you closed all borders, after your &quot;off season&quot; it would just grow in numbers again, as it was never completely gone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To echo what everyone here is saying, colds persist all year long but they do have an increase during the fall and winter, but it’s more of a combination of things. Rhinoviruses thrive in cold and dry air, which happens to coincide with more human interaction because we go to school and congregate inside during the colder months. That allows it to be passed more easily but in general, those viruses just <em>do better</em> in cold and dry air. No one knows exactly why yet. That being said, they still infect and get transmitted during warm and humid months. Usually the viruses are “self limiting” in that they infect, do their thing and then get killed. However, they can remain dormant in the host cells after the usual die off period, especially in the case of immuno-compromised patients. While the virus won’t be found in the usual places, traces of their genetic makeup can be found in cells deeper in the body and has been found to persist up to 455 days. So basically, the virus is hiding inside the body but remains dormant (like herpes does) and then once outside conditions are good it comes out of hiding to go wreak some havoc. All these things mashed together makes it look like it suddenly comes back in the winter but the reality is that it’s here all along constantly infecting people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
