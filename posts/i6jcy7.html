		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_plant" target="_blank">Parasitic plants</a>. Like carnivorous plants, plant-on-plant parasitism has evolved multiple times independently in several different groups, their strategy essentially boiling down to leeching, in part or fully, nutrition and water from other plants. There are about 4,500 known parasitic plants. Indeed, you may be very familiar with one of them: mistletoe.</p>
<p>Mistletoes (a name we give to several similarly-behaving parasitic plant groups within the order <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santalales" target="_blank">Santalales</a>), as in many parasitic plants, send root-like tendrils into the main body of their hosts - tapping into sources of water and nutrition they can redirect to themselves. Mistletoes do still photosynthesise, assorted species doing so to varying extreme degrees at different times throughout their life cycles, and therefore they do still engage in some primary production independent of the host. We call this 'partial parasitism' hemiparasitism. </p>
<p>Other plants take things much further however, and give up on photosynthesis altogether; their entire lives dependent on leeching what they can outta' other plants (known as holoparasites). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia" target="_blank"><em>Rafflesia</em></a> - a genus of plants that produce the largest individual flowers in the world (<a href="https://diytravelhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/searching-for-rafflesia-in-bukittinggi.jpg" target="_blank">human for scale</a>) - are a good example. <em>Rafflesia</em> seeds invade vine tendrils in their rainforest homes, and then spend the bulk of their entire lives as a web of filamentous thread-like tissue entirely within the vine plant, lacking anything resembling leaves, roots, stems and other bits you'd expect a flowering plant to have. Looking at a vine in a rainforest, you would have no idea another plant is pursuing a secret life within. After leeching enough nutrients, <em>Rafflesia</em> eventually invest in flowering buds which pierce the outer structure of the vine, becoming visible to the outer world, and then promptly flower, get pollinated (by resembling and smelling like rotting meat and attracting flies; hence their other name 'corpse flower'), and continuing the life cycle.</p>
<p>Indian pipe (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotropa_uniflora" target="_blank"><em>Monotropa uniflora</em></a>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydnora" target="_blank"><em>Hydnora spp.</em></a> are other examples of holoparasitic plants with cool and/or freaky lookin' emergences. <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ee/2b/93/ee2b930d0da7578fc3ed697bb8dfc50d.jpg" target="_blank">Hmm</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I found some during Iowa mycology class field collection. They are actually plants with no chlorophyll which parasitize mycorrhizal fungi that are associated with tree roots. So the carbohydrates it consumes to live are made in tree leaves, taken underground via phloem, shared with beneficial mycelia which act as extended root networks for trees, then stolen by the flute.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mistletoe I know literally taps into other trees life forces. Like grows from the inside out. Then there's like strangler figs, initially a vine grows around trees and strangles them. The trees die and rot away but the fig vine is now so large it's basically a tree. Then there's a couple white plants that don't have chlorophyll and they nab nutrients and carbon from fungi that are symbiotic with other normal plants.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
