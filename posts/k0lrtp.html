		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some hold less energy but also the chemicals in rechargables produce a lower voltage (1.2v instead of 1.5v) lots of devices will detect rechargables as less than full battery even when fully charged since the voltage is lower. On top of that the voltage might drop below operational threshold sooner since they start lower. </p>
<p>To add to that regargables degrade over time so eventually they hold less charge and wear out with greater frequency.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There isn't huge different between capacities, since they are somewhere around 2500mAh for modern batteries, it's just that some devices can't use all of that due to lower cell voltage.<br />
At around 1.2V standard alkalines are pretty much dead while NiMhs still have about 40% of capacity. So with around 2500mAh cells, you are only getting about 1500mAh. That means that if device was designed to shut off at around 1.2V, you might get 30 min of use for device that might last 1 hour with standard batteries. </p>
<p>Rechargeables also have higher self discharge, which means they shouldn't be used in low power devices like clocks or TV remotes since they would drain itself in few months (there are low self discharge versions, but they still have higher self discharge than alkalines and they cost a bit more).We also tend to use alkalines in devices that aren't power hungry so they last long while most power hungry devices use rechargeables.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you've tied a heavy weight to a pulley up in the air. When you first did it, you had a tractor pull the weight to the top so you get the maximum thump when it hits the ground. After you've used it once, you aren't able to use the tractor again, so your buddies will help you pull it as high as possible. But, since you're all human, you can't quite reach the same height as the tractor did, so you all agree to give up somewhere near the top. When you let go, there's still a thump, but it's not as satisfying.</p>
<p>The tractor pulled rock is a non-rechargable battery. The weight that you and your buddies pulled is the rechargeable one - not as efficient, but you don't need to borrow uncle Mickey's tractor to head down to the store and buy new batteries.</p>
<p>The reason for rechargeable batteries not being as great is the concentration gradient - the electron slush inside the battery is designed that you can put all the electrons back into the right place, but as you get to higher charges, you end up working against the new gradient and it's just not worth it to get it to the 99-100% charge level, so your battery might top out anywhere between 60-80%. (Pure estimate, please don't quote me)</p>
<p>I'm sure there's a university-level answer with a breakdown that mentions vanadium, but I tried for a ELI5 and then maybe a high school level in the third paragraph.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Besides technical reasons, rechargeable batteries are used where the energy demand is high, where you would have to buy single batteries often. Like laptops and phones. Recharging them often justifies the higher price.</p>
<p>Single use batteries often go in low energy appliances like clocks and remotes, so appear to last much longer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other answers, it depends which ones you buy. Rechargeable batteries lose energy over time even if they're doing nothing but some lose it faster than others. &quot;Low self-discharge&quot; batteries like Eneloop will need recharging less frequently because they manage to hold onto more of their energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
