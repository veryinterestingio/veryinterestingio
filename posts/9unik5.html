<p>Can someone please explain to me, why a horse was put down today because  of a fractured shoulder? Albeit the horse probably wouldn't be good for  racing anymore, but surely the injury isn't &quot;that far gone&quot; that it  warrants the animals death? Like, couldn't it spend its days at a petting zoo or something?</p></div></div>

<p>Horses weigh a lot, and laying down for long periods can cause issues with blood flow and nerve damage to the parts that are on the ground, simply due to the pressure their weight puts on their body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For horses it's not a minor injury.  They put extreme amounts of stress on their legs and shoulders.  If it is a stress fracture or simple fracture, then it can heal slowly and normally be okay.  If it if a split fracture or compound fracture it normally comes with a ton of other complications and can't heal correctly.  Vets know this and rather than putting the horse through a lot of pain, they put them down to ease their suffering.</p>
<p>Some people will keep the horse alive if it a champion line and sell the sperm.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main issue is that horses can't simply stay off their broken bone while it heals up. A horse's body is huge, thick, and dense. It's only really built for standing position long-term. If they spend any real amount of time laying down or on their side, the more elevated half of their body slowly crushes the organs and tissues in the less elevated side, while their blood starts pooling in certain places and not flowing to others. This is especially a problem with their lungs, which get crushed and constrained by weight and pooled blood and can't expand properly. They also suffer nerve damage, joint damage as they try to stand again, and all sorts of other issues. </p>
<p>This is why a foal/baby horse tends to sleep lying down a lot, when they're small and light with thinner less muscular bodies, but as they grow up they sleep lying down less and less and start going into a restful state while standing more often instead.</p>
<p>A horse <em>needs</em> to be in a standing position most of the time. All of those things happening causes tremendous physical pain and the horse will try desperately to resume standing. If it <em>can't</em> stand, because it can't put enough weight on a leg, because a cast or other device on one leg prevents it from going through the range of motion necessary to lift itself up, etc, the horse becomes extremely distressed. Horses are prone to panic and it's very upsetting to see how terrified and distressed a horse can become in this kind of situation. Remember that horses are skittish at the best of times and their instinct is always to run from danger; if the horse not only can't run but can't stand to turn around and keep an eye out, it feels incredibly vulnerable and scared.</p>
<p>If the horse is injured in a way that makes it unable to bear its own weight while standing, or have a decent range of motion, and it's going to take a while for that injury to heal, there's typically not much you can do. Sometimes it's just impossible for the horse to live through the healing process and sometimes it's possible but likely to involve months and months of intense distress and pain. For your dog three months in a cast is a weird inconvenience it quickly adapts to, for your horse it's a harrowing nightmare that likely results in its painful and suffocating death.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello, I’m a vet student. If a horse suffers a fracture (break) of any part of any leg, unfortunately it’s basically game over. This horse’s fractured “shoulder” (exactly which bone they’re referring to is unclear) conjures images of a human shoulder - if fractured, this is certainly survivable. The issue is horse anatomy: for a horse, the shoulder is a weighbearing joint, crudely analogous to the human hip. Horses simply must have all four legs working. They can’t rest a broken leg to allow it to heal, they’re bloody heavy and they don’t listen to medical advice. It’s a real shame but it is ultimately a quality of life issue and despite what people may think, veterinary professionals always act in the interest of the animal’s welfare. Sometimes euthanasia is the most appropriate treatment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
