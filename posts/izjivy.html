		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What's the per-neuron or per-synapse data / memory storage capacity of the human brain (on average)?</p>
<p>I was reading the Wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animals_by_number_of_neurons" target="_blank">animals by number of neurons</a>. It lists humans as having 86 billion neurons and 150 trillion synapses.</p>
<p>If you can store 1 bit per synapse, that's only 150 terabits, or <strong>18.75 Terabytes</strong>. That's not a lot.</p>
<p>I also was reading about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthymesia" target="_blank">Hyperthymesia</a>, a condition where people can remember massive amounts of information. Then, there's individuals with developmental disability like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek" target="_blank">Kim Peek</a> who can read a book, and remember everything he read.</p>
<p>How is this possible? Even with an extremely efficient data compression algorithm, there's a limit to how much you can compress data. How much data is really stored per synapse (or per neuron)?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The brain is a computer analogy is nice sometimes, but it doesn't work in many cases. Information isn't stored in a neuron or at synapses per se, and we're not certain exactly how information is stored in the brain at this point.</p>
<p>Best we can tell information recall happens as a product of simultaneous firing of neuron ensembles. So, for example, if 1000 neurons all fire at the same time we might get horse, if another 1000 neurons fire we might get eagle. Some number of neurons might overlap between the two animals, but not all. Things that are more similar have more overlap (the percent of the same group of neurons that fire for horse and eagle might be higher than horse and tree because horse and eagle are both animals).</p>
<p>With this type of setup, the end result is much more powerful than the sum of parts.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I did not have time to answer a lot of good comments last night, so I am attempting to give some answers to common ones here.</p>
<ol>
<li>I simplified these ideas a ton hoping to make it more understandable. If you want a in depth review this (doi: 10.1038/s41593-019-0493-1) review is recent and does a nice job covering what we believe about memory retrieval through neuronal engrams. It is highly technical, so if you want something more geared to the non-scientist I suggest the book ‘Connectome’ by Sebastian Seung. The book isn’t entirely about memory recall, and is a slightly outdated now, but does a nice job covering these ideas and is written by an expert in the field.</li>
<li>My understanding of computer science is  limited, and my field of study is behavioral neurochemistry, not memory. I know enough about memory retrieval because it is important to all neuroscientists , but I am not pushing the field forward in any way. That said, I don't really know enough to comment on how the brain compares to non-traditional computer systems like analogue or quantum computers. There are some interesting comments about these types of computers in this thread though.</li>
<li>Yes ‘information’ is stored in DNA, and outside experience can change the degree to which a specific gene is expressed by a cell . However, this does not mean that memories can be stored in DNA. DNA works more like a set of instructions for how the machinery that makes up a cell should be made and put together; the machinery then does the work (which in this case would be information processing). There are elaborate systems withing the cell to ensure that DNA is not changed throughout the life of a cell, and while expression of gene can and does change regularly, no new information is added to to the DNA of a neuron in memory consolidation.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neurons don't work like individual bits of a data in a hard drive. They basically work all of their memory from association. It's based on the concept of &quot;<em>neurons that fire together, wire together</em>&quot; and vice versa. It's best explained with an example. I'll use &quot;horse&quot; since another comment mentioned it. When you hear the word &quot;horse&quot; you probably have dozens of neurons all firing in recognition. They are each in different locations if your brain related to different aspects of memory. Example, let's say when you were a child you went to a petting zoo and saw a horse for the first time.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the speech center if your brain, a cluster of neurons associated with the sound of the word &quot;horse&quot; light up. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Somewhat nearby, other auditory neurons are hearing a horse whinny for the first time and they are all firing as they process the sound.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In your visual memory center, neurons associated with learning the basic image/shape of a horse will fire.</p>
</li>
<li>In the sensory part of your brain, neurons that are tasked with remembering the smell of that horse stable will light up</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on. When you first encounter a horse, neurons in each of those parts of your brain (touch, sound, shape, etc) will all be firing. And since &quot;<em>neurons that fire together, wire together</em>&quot; a link gets formed between each group of neurons. Then in the future whenever any one individual neuron in that link gets activated, the entire chain fires up because, again, <em>&quot;neurons that wire together, fire together</em>&quot;. So when you are walking by a farm and hear a distant horse whinny, or catch the faintest smell of the stable, and your entire related nerve cluster of <em>horse name-look-smell-sound</em> immediately fires and you know there's a horse over there.</p>
<p>It's a fairly effective and robust system of memory, but it doesn't translate well to bits on a hard drive. How many bits would your horse memory be? Is it just the X amount of neural connections between various memory neurons? Even that's not a good representation because some neurons have hundreds of connections and are triggered for various different memories. (For example the sound of a horse whinny might be triggered by neuronal clusters for memories about &quot;horse&quot; but also be used for recalling knowledge about &quot;generic animal sounds&quot;) </p>
<p>Trying to quantify exactly how much knowledge a brain holds is a nearly impossible task because some extremely simple &quot;memories&quot; are actually requiring tens of thousands of neural connections, while other single neural connections might account for a dozen different &quot;memories&quot;. </p>
<p>It would be like working with a hard drive where some bits are actually several megabytes of data, and other groups of millions of bits form only one kilobyte.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong> Brains store vast sums of experience in a fairly simplistic form that is effective, but it's a form of memory &quot;storage&quot; that is wildly inconsistent in regards to trying to quantify just how much actual data it contains. </p>
<p>Any attempt at trying to compare a brain to a computer hard drive just breaks down because they are working with utterly different concepts of how data is stored. To use one last analogy, <strong>it would be like asking &quot;how many descriptive words does a painting hold?</strong>&quot;. The answer is impossible to define.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>That spider had the spot she liked, and to pull it off had to stretch a web from the cable line leading to our house from the telephone pole, to a tree in our front yard, like an 8 foot gap or more, and then 6 feet down to the ground for another anchor, then spin the actuall web.  After that web was up, she was a master fly catcher with intense reaction times, pouncing on prey in fractions of a second. End of the night the whole web would be taken down by her and she would hide in the tree. This spider had our front yard mapped out.</p>
<p>All this accomplished with a brain that wouldn't even leave a visible mark if you smeered it on a white wall with your fingertip.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EDIT: I found <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4737657/?report=classic" target="_blank">this article</a> where-in the authors predicted neuronal synapses contain - on average - 4.7 bits of information. I haven't read it in detail, but it seems they based this off synaptic plasticity - the ability for a synapse to change it's size, strength, etc. - specifically the breadth of synaptic phenotypes. The introduction is brief and gives a good overview of the subject. Also, here's the abstract (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Information in a computer is quantified by the number of bits that can be stored and recovered. An important question about the brain is how much information can be stored at a synapse through synaptic plasticity, which depends on the history of probabilistic synaptic activity. The strong correlation between size and efficacy of a synapse allowed us to estimate the variability of synaptic plasticity. In an EM reconstruction of hippocampal neuropil we found single axons making two or more synaptic contacts onto the same dendrites, having shared histories of presynaptic and postsynaptic activity. The spine heads and neck diameters, but not neck lengths, of these pairs were nearly identical in size. <strong>We found that there is a minimum of 26 distinguishable synaptic strengths, corresponding to storing 4.7 bits of information at each synapse</strong>. Because of stochastic variability of synaptic activation the observed precision requires averaging activity over several minutes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Easy answer</strong>: We don't know for certain, and it depends on a lot of factors and the &quot;type&quot; of information.</p>
<p><strong>Long-winded ramble that mostly stays on-topic</strong>: Basically, it depends on how you define &quot;information&quot;. In the broadest sense, information is data about a system that can be used to predict other states of the system. If I know that I dropped a ball from 10 meters on Earth, I have two pieces of information - height and Earth's acceleration - and can thus predict that the ball will hit the ground in just over a second. If I just say, &quot;I drop a ball&quot;, then there's less information since you can no longer reliably predict when it will hit the ground.</p>
<p>To get a bit more grounded, each cell contains millions of bits in the nucleus alone, thanks to DNA. Ordered cellular systems - e.g. cytoskeleton, proteins, electrochemical gradient, etc. - can also be said to contain information; e.g. proteins are coded by RNA which is coded by DNA. But I think you're driving at the systemic information content of the brain; i.e. not just ordered systems, but computational capacity, in which case it's more appropriate to treat neurons as indivisible units, the fundamental building blocks of our brain computer.</p>
<p>A single neuron can have thousands of synapses, both dendritic (receive synaptic signals) and axonal (send synaptic signals). However, a neuron typically is an &quot;all or nothing&quot; system that is either firing or not firing; this is analogous to a bit of information, which is either a 0 or a 1. Knowing this we could conjecture that each neuron is one bit, but then we have to account for time. In other words, some neurons can fire dozens of times per second, while at other times they may fire once in several seconds. This is important because rapid firing can have different effects than slow firing; e.g. if the sending neuron is excitatory, then it sending rapid action potentials to another neuron will make that neuron more likely to fire its own action potentials. However, if the sending excitatory neuron only fires a handful of times per second (i.e. relatively slow), the receiving neuron won't receive enough stimulation to fire its own action potential. So the speed of action potentials also carries information. Then we get into different types of synapses; broadly, we can categorize neuron-to-neuron synapses as excitatory or inhibitory: excitatory makes the receiving neuron more likely to fire, and inhibitory makes them less likely to fire.</p>
<p>To recap so far: we have to consider the number of neurons, the number of synapses on each neuron, the rate at which their firing action potentials through those synapses, and what type of synapse it is. But wait, there's more!</p>
<p>We've only talked about pairs of neurons, but most neurons receive and/or project synapses to dozens, even hundreds or thousands, of neurons. Let's consider a typical pyramidal neuron found in the cortex. For simplicity, we'll say it receives 10 action potentials over a short period of time; 3 of them were from inhibitory interneurons, and the other 7 were from excitatory neurons. Excitatory action potentials make it easier for the neuron to fire, and since it received more excitatory action potentials it will likely fire. In other words, there is computation going on inside the neuron as its biochemistry reacts to the incoming action potentials, computation that determines if the excitatory input exceeds the action potential threshold, and whether inhibitory input is strong enough to negate this.</p>
<p>So now we have to consider the ratio of synaptic inputs <em>and</em> their firing rate. Then you have to factor in all kinds of other variables, such as the size of the neuron, it's resting membrane potential, the types of synaptic receptors, whether it sends excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitters, and so on. All of this computation just to decide whether the neuron is a 0 or a 1.</p>
<p>The last thing I'll put forward is that our brain is exceptionally good at compressing information. We receive ~<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14681360500487470" target="_blank">11 million bits of information per second</a>, but cognitively we can only process about 50 bits/second. Think about all of the different sensations you could focus on: touch, temperature, hunger, those socks you're wearing, tiredness, vision, hearing, thought, etc. We focus on one at a time because that's all we can handle (our brains barely have enough energy to light a refrigerator light bulb, so they have to be very economical with processing); our brain's job is to filter out all of the superfluous information so we can focus on the important stuff. For example the visual system receives tons of information every second from our high-resolution retinas; these signals are conveyed to our visual cortex and broken down into base components (e.g. a house would be decomposed into straight lines, angles, light/dark areas, etc.), then integrated into more complex objects (e.g. a square), which are then integrated with context and knowledge (e.g. large square in this place is likely a house), and finally awareness (e.g. &quot;I see a house&quot;). Instead of having to think through all of that computation and logic consciously, our visual and integration cortices handle it &quot;under the hood&quot; and just give &quot;us&quot; (i.e. our conscious selves) the final output.</p>
<p>Remarkably, we can somehow store far more than 50 bits. We don't know &quot;where&quot; memories are stored, but we do know that certain neuronal firing patterns are associated with different information. For example, neuronal circuits are often firing at a specific frequency that changes based on your thoughts, behavior, environment, and where you are in the brain; e.g. your brain &quot;defaults&quot; to a 40Hz (40 times per second) frequency of firing when you zone out and stare off into space; alpha rhythms (~10Hz) appear when you close your eyes; etc. These may be byproducts of other computations, or they may be computations in and of themselves; to oversimplify, a 20Hz frequency in a certain circuit may encode &quot;dog&quot;, but a 30Hz may encode &quot;cat&quot; (possibly by activating neuronal circuits sensitive to the individual frequencies).</p>
<p>There's so much more I could talk about on this, but I have to move on, so let's put it all together.</p>
<p>Neurons can either fire or not fire, which intrinsically encodes information. The rate at which they fire also encodes information, as well as the type of neuron, the number of synapses, the number of currently active synapses, the signal polarity (i.e. inhibitory or excitatory), and many other factors. Computationally, neurons generally try to streamline information to reduce processing burden. Depending on where in a brain circuit you are, the neurons may be conveying very granular information or very consolidated information. Regardless, information content of a given synapse or neuron is so context-dependent - on the neuron, the synapse, the circuit it's a part of, etc. - that you'd need to be very precise in defining the system before you could begin crunching numbers to make predictions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A synapse or a neuron is not a bit.  Instead, the data appears to be stored in neural pathways consisting of neurons connected by synapses.  If you play with simple polygons, connecting their vertices in all the possible ways, you'll quickly see that the number of possible connections grows faster than the number of vertices.</p>
<p>But I don't think we have a good, 'mechanistic' or 'instrumental' grasp on how memories are stored in, or by, the brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
