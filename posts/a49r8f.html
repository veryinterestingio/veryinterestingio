<blockquote>
<p>Some rocks can be affected by sunlight (for example, realgar). Usually it is the ultraviolet portion of sunlight that will do the damage, by breaking chemical bonds. For this to happen the bonds must be fairly weak. Other rocks, those with strong chemical bonds, are very unlikely to be affected by sunlight. Sunlight can also enhance chemical erosion (e.g. the dissolution of limestone by acids...either natural carbonic or man-made acid rain) by supplying energy.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a mineral collector I am aware of various types of quartz crystals and other minerals that will fade in color over time under direct sunlight. Amethyst, for example, gets its color from a type of iron impurity that forms during underground crystallization with the presence of gamma radiation (<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4020-2852-6_63" target="_blank">source</a>), and this process can be reversed by UV light, turning the crystal back towards a milky white color. Interestingly as well, heat-treating amethyst turns it from purple to orange (aka &quot;citrine&quot; and virtually all the dark orange citrine sold on the market is heat treated amethyst, but that is off the topic of sunlight/UV). <a href="https://www.mindat.org/photo-700718.html" target="_blank">Photographic example</a> and <a href="https://www.mindat.org/min-198.html" target="_blank">source</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer this question, we have to think about the chemistry that makes things colorful. In particular, there are two mechanisms I'm going to talk about: an organic one and an inorganic one. </p>
<p>In the inorganic strategy, the color is a property of an atom. Take an atom of gold, for instance, or another of silver. The color of these atoms comes from a difference in energy levels that their electrons can occupy. This difference corresponds to a certain amount of energy, which corresponds to a certain frequency (and thus wavelength) of light. These don't fade in the sun's intense ultraviolet light because ultraviolet light won't change the energy levels of an atom.*</p>
<p>On the other hand, many of the things we encounter in day-to-day life (especially human-made things) get their color from the organic mechanism. This would include things like leaves, paint, or magazine covers. The story of how these items get their color is a bit more complicated. They contain organic (carbon-containing) compounds that have many double bonds. These double bonds, when they're adjacent to one another, create a &quot;corral&quot; of sorts for electrons to occupy. The more double bonds, the bigger the corral. Just like kids, the more cooped-up the electrons in the corral are, the more energy they have, so bigger corrals have lower energy levels. From here, the explanation is similar to above: it's all about energy levels and the difference between them. </p>
<p>The difference in this explanation, though, is that it's based on bonds. Bonds can be broken. Ultraviolet light in particular is good at this. When ultraviolet light hits one of these bonds just so, it adds a ton of energy to it and breaks it. When one of these double bonds break, it changes the size of the corral, and thus changes the color. </p>
<p>Rocks are mostly an example of the former, inorganic strategy, and so sunlight/ultraviolet light doesn't directly change their color. Some rocks do get their color from the second mechanism, and so these would be subject to change. (As one last aside, both of the mechanisms we just learned about we understand through the principles of quantum mechanics, which I think is pretty cool.)</p>
<p>*There are other things we can do to change these energy levels and thus the color, like oxidizing (process that turns iron to rust) them. But these don't use ultraviolet light - although as u/roosterkun correctly pointed out, the energy from ultraviolet light can sometimes make these things happen faster or shift equilibria. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
