		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's more geographical than historical.</p>
<p>You need to feed a large population. India and China have lots of suitable farmland. Farming takes a great deal of labor so the more people in your family, the better you can farm, encouraging a large population. Nowadays with modern farming methods and fertilizer, you can produce even more food to support a larger population into the billions.</p>
<p>The other regions that have comparable farmland are the fertile crescent (Middle East) and the Nile flood plains, and the United States. The fertile crescent spanning the Mediterranean, Black, and Red Seas is where farming originally began. However, the history of conflicts there have not allowed stable farming in that region. Despite supporting the Ancient Egyptians, the Nile's flood plains have been in decline. Lastly, the US is recently settled and most of the farming goes towards exports and animal feed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They both had a perfect mix of political reasons, geographics reasons and cultural reasons that allowed for their populations to aggressively spike to the point that they had the largest populations in the world. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Politically, having extremely large families was encouraged (before China had one child policy). As a means to fill the gap left by huge populations losses. WW2 took it's toll on both nations and they desperately needed people to help the population back to a stable level.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Geographically, both nations can support a large populations. With lots of rich farmland and generally easy access to water, it allowed for a large population to be developed. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also culturally, having a large family was either wanted or not looked down upon. As both countries had lots of farmers, kids were a source of free farm labor. Also both cultures encouraged having male children, so parents of females would &quot;try again&quot; until they got a boy.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>TL;DR: A mix of different reasons and conditions at the right place and the right time</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Arable land that is good for agriculture. India have 1.7 million square kilometer, US have 1.6, Russia have 1.2, China have 1.1, brazil have 0.7, Australia have 0.47, Canada have 0.46, Argentina have 0.38. As you can see the US, Brazil, Australia, Canada and Argentina are all new world territory that didn't have much people since they were not connected to the Old world for a long time. Russia is a rather cold country and didn't developped until the middle ages so that leave us with India and China only. Just for comparaison, Western/Central Europe have around 0.6 millions square kilometer of arable land. So it's near the top, but still not as much as China or India.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the 18th century, China’s population, which had been relatively stable at between 50-100 million for almost a thousand years suddenly started surging. The origins of the population surge can be traced to three factors: </p>
<ol>
<li>Extended period of international peace that followed the Manchu conquest of China. (With the country at peace, there was a decline in domestic mortality rate)</li>
<li>The Manchu regime carried a major campaign to repair long neglected dikes and irrigation works along the Yellow and Yangtze rivers. (This lead to fewer fatalities from flood, drought, water borne diseases and malnutrition)</li>
<li>There was a significant rise in female fertility, resulting in a substantial and prolonged “baby boom.”</li>
</ol>
<p>This population surge beginning in the early 18th century did not abate for more than two centuries thereafter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
