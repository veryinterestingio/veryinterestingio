And how come for people who have a 9 to 5 have like and hour to drive to the shop and buy a futon. Also on the weekends they shorten the hours! I may be stupid but I'm not dumb to see there's a large market for buying futons at 1:30am</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for all the great answers everyone, I actually work as a cashier at a grocery store so I feel pretty stupid, the only time we have rushes are during lunch time and after 3-5 so I figured the 9-5 was the main working architype. Also didn't realize most people can just leave work to do shopping.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't work a 9-5 (grad student) and I end up doing a decent amount of shopping during those hours (mostly grocery).  There's a decent amount of people.  Not everyone works a 9-5, stay at home parents are actually fairly common, and don't forget retired people.  It's nowhere near as crowded like when i'm there in the 5:30-6:30 range but there's a decent amount of people.  </p>
<p>There actually isn't a huge market for futons at 1:30 am.  A lot of stores are more crowded at 10:00 Am than Pm, even on the weekdays.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in a large warehouse retail type store. Over 70% of our revenue is from Business2Business sales, rather than Business2Customer. This is the main driver of being “open” between 7am and 5pm on weekdays. Many of these businesses will have an official “purchasing officer” who comes into the store to purchase the items they need. If we weren’t open they’d simply go to the next store that is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
