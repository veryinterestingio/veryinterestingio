In the real world you might have 2 miles of identical residential streets in one housing area, in the game it's just two streets. So you still get the feeling of neighbourhoods, but they're all tiny versions of the real ones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A full day in <strong>GTA 5</strong> takes 48 minutes <strong>real time</strong>. One hour takes 2 minutes.</p>

<p>So if it takes 8 minutes real time to drive there, your in game clock will have progressed by 4 hours.</p>

<p>In general, the time you want a player to spend in the game should feel meaningful. In an open world, this is REALLY important. I've made the drive from Denver to Phoenix. It's 13 hours and it mostly sucks, but what do I remember? Denver, Colorado Springs, Albuquerque, Phoenix. So if I were to put that in a game, I would make those cities and then cut out most of the travel time in between. That way players would get the memorable parts without the tedium of all that travel time. Boom, now your open world feels big, but also meaningful because your time wasn't wasted.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to the cities themselves. You don't need a house for every NPC, you just need one residential street and the player will fill in the rest. Give your players all the meaningful utilities (clothing shops, auto dealers, gunsmiths, etc.) and then provide enough space around it to feel memorable without wasting time. Boom, believable city. </p>
<p>Put those together, and you can even make interstate travel feel reasonable (see Horizon: Zero Dawn or RDR2).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
