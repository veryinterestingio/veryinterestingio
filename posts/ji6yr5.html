		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is nearly impossible to remove something completely from the internet. Your answers are most likely still there. If they're not it could be because the hosting Website is no longer online.</p>
<p>What's most likely happening is that pages like Chegg and Coursehero have a higher rank on the search engine and thus being displayed first. The &quot;old&quot; pages are being pushed further down as their rank isn't as high.</p>
<p>Another explanation might be that those pages pay the search engines to get displayed on the first page (think of it like ads).</p>
<p>Try to alter your search query in a way that it looks less like a homework related question. That increases your chances of getting to free answers. You can even try advanced search queries to exclude those homework pages from the search results.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>They pay Google to prioritize their search results.    </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Man, I could rant on this for hours.  I'm sure there are others who have been on the internet in here, since the early 90s.  People who remember there being 10+ legitimate web search engines, not just ones that were jokes.  We had Lycos, Webcrawler, Yahoo (when it was just search), and so many more.  Search engines are now, a bastardization of what we once had.  Ad revenues and product placement have taken what was truly a search of the Internet, into something that looks like a search result, but is more and more curated for you.  The illusion of information is still there, but good luck finding anything they don't want you to see.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
