		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With a spice kit.</p>
<p>The line is deenergized and divers will bring the cable up to surface and install a splice kit at the needed section.  If too deep (typically ocean repairs) remotely operated vehicles will make the repair by cutting the cable and bringing the ends up to the surface. If the river is small, they will cut the cable on dry land make the tie in there and run another cable to the other side and make the other tie in. No need for divers.</p>
<p>Edit: clarified some things. Still leaving spice kit though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Daveed is correct sometimes. </p>
<p>Often the cable will be concrete encased, or in conduit. In that case, it will generally be cheaper/quicker to splice back on dry land and just pull a new run of whatever cable is failed. </p>
<p>Sometimes it might even be cheaper to use a boring rig to bore in an entirely new run of cable. </p>
<p>It depends on the situation; the depth of the river, the distance to the failure point, how many failure points are suspected, size of the cable, number of runs, etc can all have an effect on the decision made on how to repair. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>We had a kind of insurrance which would warranty us a boat available for repair ir 48h. When it happen the cutoff was not as clear as expected so we did some mc guivering to have a clear cut that we can locate. Then the boat came, pulled the cable to the surface, repaired it and put it back.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is possible using the speed of electrons to estimate where in a line that a break has occurred. It sends out a pulse and measures how long it takes it to travel down the line, hit the break and bounce back which gives them an estimate of where in the line the problem is. TDR is an example of this and it relies upon a physical property of electromagnetism where the jump from a conductor to air at the end of a cable, or a break in it, will reflect some of this energy back in the other direction. It's the reason that old network and SCSI bus cables used to need resistor/terminators installed to absorb this back reflected  energy or it would cause noise on the bus. <a href="http://ecmweb.com/content/locating-underground-cable-fault" target="_blank">This is an excellent article on fault isolation using a few techniques</a></p>
<p>How it's actually repaired will depend upon how the cable is ran. If it's a buried cable they will have to dig it up on land and attempt either a bypass or a repair on site. For instance you splice in a new length of cable on one side of the river, and then pull it through to the other side pulling on the existing cable to feed the new length through.</p>
<p>Usually with underwater cable runs it isn't buried and it's possible for repair ships to pull the cable off the bottom and onto the ship, effect a repair and lay the cable back down when it's finished. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
