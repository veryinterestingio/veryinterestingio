		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electromagnetic waves (in vacuum) and gravitational waves that are emitted by a source are predicted to travel at c. We’ve recently been able to detect gravitational waves thanks to LIGO/Virgo. In particular, one paper managed to confirm this by using a binary neutron star merger event. The single event emitted electromagnetic and gravitational radiation, meaning that you can detect both separately. If the electromagnetic radiation and gravitational radiation arrive at nearly the same time, then that shows the gravitational radiation must travel at nearly the same speed since the source is extremely far away. </p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you have an event that only emits gravitational waves, then you can approximately calculate the speed by comparing its arrival time between different points on Earth. However, this will be less accurate than the former method, as you would need multiple detectors to make a precise measurement and gravitational wave detection is state of the art.</p>
<p>For reference, we have good theoretical reasons why gravitational waves should move at the speed of light. The equations of general relativity have been fairly well tested and you can use the equations to derive what the speed of gravitational waves must be, so many physicists were fairly confident of this even before rigorous detection. You can also argue from causality etc., but keep in mind that it can be shown precisely and mathematically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sir Isaac Newton was allegedly responsible for the earliest measurements involving gravity, which involved two balls of different size / weight being dropped from a height at the same time and seeing which landed first. This in effect discovered the speed and the rate of acceleration of gravity when compared to the earth. Acceleration is at -9.81 m/s/s so the speed of an object will travel at said speed after one second, 19.62 m/s after two, etc. However, this is left all relative to the earth. In space, all the planets, the sun, nearby galaxies, all of them are acting a force on each other all the time. </p>
<p>While Newton believed Gravity was sort of an ‘instant reaction’, Einstein had a theory that Gravity and the Speed of Light were directly connected. Think of it like this. If the Sun were taken out of our solar system, immediately, with no sort of visible outside force, what would happen to the earth? Newton’s theory is that we would immediately be shot off into space until we either collided with something or fell into a new orbit, but Einstein’s theory would state that the effect of our orbit would remain for approximately 8 and a half minutes, the same amount of time it takes for us to see light from the sun. </p>
<p>So the big problem with proving this theory right is that gravity can’t really be measured in wave form. We can’t see it. But there ARE things that we can see that are affected by gravity. In 2002 a study was done in which a Quasar, or Quasi-Stellar Radio Source, was emitting radio waves that we were able to pick up when the Planet Jupiter was passing in direct line between the Quasar and earth. This meant that for the time Jupiter was there, the Quasar’s radio waves, tiny and yet persistent, were being bent by Jupiter’s comparatively massive celestial body. Since we could now compare Jupiter’s known mass, velocity, etc to waves that would otherwise go through relatively uninterrupted, we were able to rework the theory of relativity to find the missing information, albeit with a large margin of error. In the study, the speed of gravity was found to be approx 95% the speed of gravity, but with a margin of error of 25%. Similar tests have been repeated over the years, which has narrowed down the margin of error and definitely supports the theory that the Speed of Light and the Speed of Gravity are the same, but admittedly, there has only been a handful of experiments like this, since identifying the perfect signals + notable interference combos is not easy on the cosmic scale ( and tests on smaller scales don’t matter because the earth’s gravitational field would influence it too much to make sense. ). One such event was the merger of two Neutron Stars in 2017, which produced such amazing results that the speed of light and the speed of its radio signals were deemed practically identical to each other. However the research on this matter continues to this day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
