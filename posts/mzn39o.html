<p>But, and contextually in case of COVID-19, I have also read that, even after vaccination, the antibodies that target the virus drop in number with the passage of time. Contrary to this, I have also read that the immune system does have the ability to remember and retain information about any pathogen for extended periods of time. How do these two correlate with each other?</p>
<p>Does/Can the human immune system essentially forget the information on any pathogen after a set period of time? Is this universal to all pathogens and if not, what exactly affects this?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When a person is vaccinated, a pathogen protein/inactivated pathogen/weakened pathogen containing foreign proteins is delivered into their body (or as is the case for new generation of vaccines, a pathogen's protein is produced in vaccinated person's body)</p>
<p>Such protein is recognised as foreign by lymphocytes: B cells and T cells; as B cell response is somewhat easier to explain and responsible for production of antibodies, we will concentrate on it.</p>
<p>Upon contact with such foreign proteins and with the help of other cells, B cells start to mature and attempt to produce antibodies than have high affinity for (attach strongly to) foreign proteins. Some of those B cells that succeed in producing those high affinity antibodies will become plasma cells and will produce high amounts of antibodies but will eventually stop and die without continued stimulation by foreign protein. That's why the antibody levels will fall - unless contact with foreign protein is repeated.</p>
<p>However, some B cells become memory B cells. Those are not very active but they do have the ability to produce antibodies with high affinity for the foreign protein once activated by a particular pathogen protein. Should contact with pathogen be repeated, they will become active and some will become plasma cells that produce large amounts of antibodies. Memory B cells may last for decades in their inactive state.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, it is very beneficial for us to have the ability to mount a swifter immune response in case of repeated contact with antigene. However sometimes, it's not just the memory that would be useful but also high antibody levels and they generally fall over time.</p>
<p>To conclude: human immune system retains the ability to produce antibodies against a pathogen for decades, but unless stimulated again, the levels of those antibodies will gradually fall.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Measles is such a devastating illness in part because it depletes your immune system's memory lymphocytes which are the white blood cells that mediate your body's ability to &quot;remember&quot; how to fight different germs.</p>
<p>It's why kids who get measals are so susceptible to secondary infection, because the primary measals virus is wiping out all of their lifetime-accumulated memory T and memory B cells which are the primary force behind the bodys ability to rapidly reconstitute a defensive force against previously encountered pathogens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The top comment has explained B-memory cells, but they has potentially overstated the duration that B-memory cells retain the knowledge of the antigen. Some antigens generate B-memory cells that deteriorate faster than others, sometimes in a matter of a few years. The cause of this is unknown and this is why a vaccination schedule has variable lengths of time for boosters (second or more rounds of vaccinations to refresh the number of B-memory cells for the specified antigen).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's not so much the way the body works but more-so the physicality of storing information; that information has to be instanced as something physical, somewhere.  Be it a corner of your PC's harddisk or a cell in your body.</p>
<p>When you build a profile of a pathogen, there are immune cells that store this information so you can readily build protection against it in the future.  Think field-notes but the wildlife comes to you/us.  </p>
<p>It's not that you are 'immune' such that your body is now capable of VERY QUICKLY and EFFECTIVELY fighting off that particular pathogen; you still get sick but not 'sick', feeling sick, and not for very long.  So effective, that you and I never notice.  (If you have ever seen the Men of Letters work like they do in Britain vis-a-vis the show Supernatural, that would be an excellent example.  MoL are the immune system...).</p>
<p>If those cells are destroyed, you forget...</p>
<p>For example: Measles can impart what's known as immune-amnesia where you are more vulnerable to things you otherwise previously had protection from.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
