		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Xenon is used in XENON1T/LUX. Argon is used in Darkside and others. Liquid noble elements are usually dense, so they have a large stopping power for external backgrounds, allowing you to &quot;fiducialize&quot; away from the boundaries and get a very radiopure center to do a rare event search. Argon has an advantage over Xenon in that you can do whats called &quot;pulse shape discrination,&quot; where you look at the ratio of prompt light to delayed light in a pulse. This ratio is different for electron recoils (background) and nuclear recoils (signal), so you can be more sensitive. The issue with Argon is that there is a naturally occuring isotope, 39Ar, that beta decays and has a lifetime of 268 years. This hurts the LAr experiments a lot, unless they can source Argon from deep underground where its had time to decay. Xenon has no long lived radioisotopes (Edit: with the notable exception of the 136Xe double beta decays and 124Xe double electron capture, but these only produce a small number of electron recoils in the WIMP region of interest so they aren't a show stopper. Thanks u/sluuuurp for the correction) , but it has very marginal PSD power.</p>
<p>Edit: theres lots of other reasons, I just outlined the biggest differences between Xe and Ar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the many great reasons that u/my-secret-identity listed for using Argon vs. Xenon, the choice of a dark matter detector target (i.e. material) also depends on the mass of the nucleus.</p>
<p>Xenon is a very heavy atom. This means there are a lot of nucleons in the nucleus, and it turns out that if dark matter interacts with nuclei in the way it really should, it interacts much more strongly with large groups of nucleons as opposed to small groups of nucleons (the interaction strength scales with the number of nucleons squared). This means that if you have a detector of a given size, you're more likely to get a count from a dark matter particle if you use a heavy nucleus vs. a light nucleus. So this means heavy atoms (like Xenon) are a good target to look for dark matter.</p>
<p>Heavy atoms also have their disadvantages. Intuitively, they take more energy to &quot;kick&quot; compared to lighter atoms, so they can only detect dark matter with a fair amount of kinetic energy (i.e. heavier dark matter). If you want to look for lighter dark matter, it's best to use lighter nuclei as targets, like Silicon, Oxygen, Helium, or even Hydrogen.</p>
<p>Argon specifically is good because it's relatively cheap so you can build very big detectors, and it's relatively easy to build the detectors (its scintillation properties make it easier to identify particles in a technological sense). However, it's not very good for looking for lighter dark matter particles, for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>Source: I work in a lab developing dark matter detectors. I work on He detectors, but the lab also works on various Xe detector concepts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Of all of the suitable candidates it has one overwhelming advantage, it's cheap. The air we breathe is mostly nitrogen and most of what's left is oxygen, take those two out and most of what's left after that is Argon... about 1% of the original air and more than half of what's left once you take out the nitrogen and oxygen... it has industrial uses in welding, but that just cycles it back into the atmosphere...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So other comments have noted that argon is much less expensive than xenon. Here's why. The atmosphere you are breathing is very nearly 1% argon. The rest is about 78% nitrogen and just under 21% oxygen. Everything else (CO2, CO, N2O, even He) adds up to a tiny fraction of 1%. </p>
<p>There is a process called fractional distillation. This process uses very controlled pressures and temperatures to separate different parts of a mixture. It's how they distill alcohol. Alcohol boils at a lower temperature than water, so you can make alcohol steam while leaving the water liquid, and move that steam away and liquefy it into a separate container. </p>
<p>Well, you can do the same thing with the atmosphere. You play games with pressure and temperature, and we're talking around -300Â°F, and you can start to separate the nitrogen, oxygen, and argon in really pure forms. Argon is the most difficult to purify, due to a giant list of reasons that I'm not going to get into here, so it's the most expensive of the three main components of the atmosphere. </p>
<p>But it's super cheap compared to any less common gas other than those we make as pollutants (CO2).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
