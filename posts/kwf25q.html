		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thank you so much for this AMA! I have two questions. The first is twofold:</p>
<p>How can someone that does not have a scientific background, or who is not well versed in virology and immunology, but does want to help convince others overcome pseudoscientific, but nonesensocal arguments? For example, it might be argued to them that the vaccine contains potassium chloride which is also used in executions. It is true, but the argument is nonesense. What would you advise to steer the conversation to something they <em>can</em> control?</p>
<p>And in an alternative situation: How can someone who does have some scientific background (or, at least, to a further extend than the person they want to convince) avoid arguing with someone over specifics that they (actually) both don't know about, resulting in the well known <em>&quot;well, guess we both don't know&quot;</em>-situation? </p>
<p>My second question is whether any of you have become more sceptical about what we really know about COVID, the lockdown measures, the vaccine, etc. after having helped write this report.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of vaccine hesitancy I've seen seems to stem from distrust of the government and large corporations, recognizing their putting of personal financial gain over the best interest of the people.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for doing this very important AMA.</p>
<p>I feel annoyed with the officials in the medical community for the way efficacy of the vaccine was explained to the public. Speaking of the Moderna vaccine specifically, it was publicized as being 94% effective. My understanding is that this number is quite misleading. Considering this study only compared participants who were symptomatic and had a positive test in both treatment and placebo groups and the current social measures being taken (masks, social distancing, etc), wouldn't the true efficacy likely be much lower? Surely, with these social measures in place and the short follow up time of the trial, most patients would not have even been exposed during the trial period. This also says nothing about asymptomatic people who are contagious, which is of course a big concern with this particular virus.</p>
<p>The reason this annoys me is because members of the public who are already skeptical of this vaccine are seeing inconsistencies of information. For example, the recommendation to still wear masks and social distance after receiving the vaccine sends a mixed signal after claims of such an effective vaccine. These seemingly mixed signals have caused many to feel justified in their skepticism of this vaccine. Why do I still need to wear a mask if the vaccine is 94% effective? What aren't they telling me?</p>
<p>To be clear, I do believe this vaccine is the only way out of this pandemic and have received the first vaccination myself already. My frustration comes from what I believe to be misleading information given to the public. In an effort to make the vaccine seem stronger I believe we have in fact created more suspicion in the general public.</p>
<p>Am I misunderstanding the clinical trials? If so can you explain the results further? If not, would it not be better to present a more genuine picture of the efficacy, thus emphasizing the need for more people to get the vaccine to reach heard immunity?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As a public health professional, I think that a major driver to most of the misinterpretation of medicine and public health science is this two-sides controversial style reporting. For example, running a front page headline story about a single anaphylaxis case with only a single sentence reporting millions of event free vaccinations as a simple statistic.</p>
<p>How can we get more appropriately balanced and responsible science journalism when the majority of consumers barely even read the full headline?</p>
<p>Not to plug but a great exception has been Ed Yong's reporting this year:</p>
