		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans and animals do, to a large extent. Egg laying chickens, for example, have been shown to effectively regulate their calcium intake - if provided with regular feed and limestone (a calcium source), they will eat the regular feed during the day and the calcium in the evening, which is when their body needs it the most to form the shell of the egg they lay in the morning.</p>
<p>There have been studies utilising what’s called geometric framework analysis which show that humans eat to satisfy their protein requirement - so you will keep on eating until you have the protein your body needs, regardless of the carbohydrates and fats (and hence energy) that come with it. Your body also craves rich energy sources - sugars, easily digestible starches, and fats. This in combination with a sodium appetite (which I think all vertebrates have) can explain why food like potato chips can be so addictive.</p>
<p>I think the more you pay attention to what you eat and notice how it makes you feel, the better you will be at identifying what your body needs. Educating yourself on the nutrient values of food and what different nutrients do for you might also help - although it’s hard to tell if that’s a bit of a placebo type effect or not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I recall hearing an interview with some guy who survived being left adrift on the ocean for weeks. He managed to catch fish to eat and survived by drinking rain water. He said that he found he had an urge to eat fish eyes. Turns out they are rich in some nutrients that are not found in the rest of the animal. I imagine that he would have had to try them at least once before his body would unconsciously recognise that they contained the good stuff.</p>
<p>Edit: found the article <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/04/castaway-jose-salvador-alvarenga-survival-expert?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other" target="_blank">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/04/castaway-jose-salvador-alvarenga-survival-expert?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other</a></p>
<p>Fish eyes are full of vitamin C, who knew?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know but when i am sick (Crohn’s disease) and can’t keep food down for more than a week I always get mad cravings.  Usually for anything with tomatoes, sardines, cheese and anything salty.  I usually get anemic during those periods too.  Any other time I cannot stand sardines.  And if I am just anemic and still able to eat the cravings are only for tomatoes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. There is a well known experiment where kids are offered 21 (I think) different foods over a period of a few weeks. They ate strange combinations but always got the appropriate vitamins and minerals. </p>
<p>Although if offered high sugar items I believe this screwed up their internal system.</p>
<p>Edit: This is the study I was referring to. 15 kids tracked over 4.5 years and offered 33 different food items in unlimited quantity over that time period. </p>
