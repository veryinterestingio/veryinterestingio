		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! I'm Caitlin, a producer at PBS' science documentary series NOVA and co-host of <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpxYSWgxVt3Pyn1ovXsGQ0g/videos" target="_blank">Antarctic Extremes</a></em>. That's our new 10-part YouTube series that takes place in - you guessed it - Antarctica. Adventuring to Antarctica had been a life-long dream of mine. After all, it's the closest I can get to traveling to another planet. No joke, that really was my plan... I went to space camp at least three times as a teenager. We spent 4 weeks on &quot;the ice,&quot; based out of McMurdo Station in Oct-Nov 2018, to film and get a taste of the life lead by scientists and other personnel in one of Earth's most extreme environments. (Now you get the series title.) Some of my favorite memories include: getting to boss Arlo around. Learning to ride a snow mobile. Mt. Erebus. The baby seals. Pretending I was on Echo Base. The cookies. OMG, the cookies. Least favorite memory: let's just say my radio call sign was &quot;Can't Sleep.&quot; And penguins... seriously overrated.</p>
<p>When I'm not in Antarctica, since abandoning my childhood plans to be an astronaut (for now at least), I take on the more realistic mission of saving the planet as a filmmaker with a focus on environmental science documentaries. I studied Earth and Planetary Science and Media Studies at Harvard University, and then worked on award-winning documentaries for FRONTLINE and NOVA. Some of my climate/environment related production credits include co-producing NOVA's Emmy-nominated 2-hour television special on climate change, <em><a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/video/decoding-the-weather-machine/" target="_blank">Decoding the Weather Machine</a></em>, and the virtual reality experience <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLZPZcuvsEQ&amp;feature=emb_logo" target="_blank">Greenland Melting</a></em>. I am also host of the online interactive science game, <em><a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/labs/lab/polar/" target="_blank">Polar Lab</a></em>.</p>
<p>Hi there, Reddit! My name is Arlo Perez and I'm the co-host and editor of Antarctic Extremes, a 10-part series documenting life and science down in the coldest natural laboratory in the world. As part of the series, I got to film and interview scientists who study seals and build underwater robots. And just to give you a better sense of what it's actually like to live down there, we added a few of our favorite (mis)adventures, like the one time I got to ride an Antarctic &quot;pickle&quot;.</p>
<p>A bit about me: I'm originally from a small city in Mexico, and although I grew up with my favorite cartoon being The Wild Thornberrys, I didn't really get to see much of the world until I left my parents' place at the age of 16 and moved to the U.S. After improvising my way through the first-generation immigrant experience, adapting to American culture (y'all need to seriously step up your coffee game), and with a lot of help from friends and family, I managed to get into Boston College majoring in political science and film, work as a film PA for a year, and eventually, start my dream career at NOVA in 2018. Then, through a mixture of persistence and luck, I had the opportunity to go to Antarctica as part of my first big field assignment along with my co-worker/best friend/bossy older sister Caitlin Saks. Yeah, you read that right.</p>
<p>My first assignment was working in one of the harshest environments on Earth. On a tight deadline. With a 3-person crew. Since Caitlin gave hers, my favorite memories include: the 24 hour daylight (primo for us procrastinators). Ice-caves. Realizing that Antarctic scientists love to have karaoke night. Least favorite memory: finding out we left all of our clothes on the helicopter that dropped us off in the remote Dry Valleys...</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Research is sometimes portrayed as useless, purposeless or a waste of public money. Similarly, you mention how your study for now seems to result in (just) this documentary. (Still pretty rad imo)</p>
<p>What research in your field did you rely on, of which the purpose was initially not at all clear. Or perhaps the original purpose was not what you used it for. </p>
<p>Do you see ways in which your research could be a missing piece to someone else? Perhaps you know what other research could be done to supplement your research?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
