<p>I understand that it's researchers choosing their words carefully, since there's not evidence about a lot of things COVID related because it's so new; and policymakers don't want people to start thinking their immune and taking unnecessary risks.</p>
<p>I always thought once you had a specific virus you were immune to it until it until it mutated. I'm also not talking about colds and flus here because those are caused by several different types of viruses and have different serotypes.</p>
<p>So is it really possible that a viral infection could provide no immunity?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it is possible. And unfortunately, the first cases that come to mind are other human coronaviruses that cause common colds - you can be infected by the same virus every couple years. The general trend is that if it doesn't elicit a strong immune response, there is not a strong memory immune response, so virus-specific antibodies and T cells decline in the span of months.</p>
<p>This doesn't rule out a vaccine though. With a vaccine, you can use adjuvants to trigger a stronger immune response alongside the antigen, and provide longer-lasting memory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One virus that is quite interesting is Measles.  If an adult contracts the virus it can wipe out immunity to all the viruses they have built up defense to over their lifetime.  It does this by killing off memory cells of the immune system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're thinking about viruses that we usually clear our own, RSV is a major one (fortunately, not as much of a big deal for most people since symptoms are mild for people &gt;2 years old, but some kids can get it multiple times per season).</p>
<p>There are also other viruses that we don't necessarily clear; HSV, and pox viruses, for example, live in parts of the body forever despite having &quot;immunity&quot; after getting it. </p>
<p>Getting even more complicated, people respond differently to some viruses like HBV -- some people clear on their own, some don't, and some never develop immunity even after clearing or getting vaccinated.</p>
<p>Some viruses just don't provide lasting immunity; for instance, other coronavirus that cause the common cold are often thought to only provide transient (a few years). </p>
<p>Also remember that HIV actually attacks your immune system itself...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Immunity lasts different degrees. For SARS, you have antibodies in your blood for 3-5 years. After that, you're not &quot;not immune&quot; anymore, because the immune system has some sort of memory and can build new antibodies faster than if you had never had it. I think, the viruses of the common cold don't give you such a long immunity. Tetanus is an example where the immunity &quot;expires&quot; and you have to renew your vaccines.</p>
<p>Herpes or HIV are also examples of &quot;a viral infection [providing] no immunity&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
