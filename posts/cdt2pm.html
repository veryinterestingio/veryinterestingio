		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These orbits are very difficult to get. The two moons would need to be quite far from the planet, the planet would need to be far from its star (the planet would need a very large Hill Sphere, like Neptune).</p>
<p>In such a situation, a binary moon would be stable.</p>
<p>How it would form is another matter. The angular momentum needed is way out of whack.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is something sort of similar going on already with Saturn's moons Janus and Epimetheus. They share the same orbit, but rather than orbiting around each other, they have a horseshoe orbit where their tugging on each other causes them to slightly change their orbital radius so that they switch who is closer, but never actually pass each other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of this comes down to scale. The &quot;moons&quot; would both have to have a very small mass compared to the size of the planet that they orbit for this to be a stable arrangment. Technically, every single object found in Saturn's rings is a moon. We've never bothered to really define what might construe a moon at the smaller end, we just use different words.</p>
<p>Is it possible for two space rocks to orbit a common gravitational center, and then have that center orbit a more massive object? Absolutely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>FWIW: &quot;two bodies orbiting each other, with the combination orbiting a third larger body&quot; describes Pluto and Charon orbiting the sun, so the system you are describing is definitely possible in principle.  The centre of mass of the Pluto-Charon system lies outside Pluto's surface so they are a true binary system, albeit of unequal masses, and the pair of them orbit around the sun.  </p>
<p>The Earth and Moon &quot;orbit each other&quot; (although the centre of the system is inside the Earth so it's not really a &quot;binary set&quot;), but remember the Moon's orbit is <a href="https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/10979/moons-orbit-around-the-sun" target="_blank">dictated more by the sun's gravity than the Earth's</a> - when the Moon is directly between the Earth and the sun it's still accelerating towards the sun.</p>
<p>As you scale the masses and distances the dynamics change so it might not be possible for eg. the moons of Jupiter/Saturn to behave this way, or or at least only possible for very small moons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
