		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your question includes a few common misconceptions, one that's been addressed already.</p>
<p>Humans need a balanced diet, but that doesn't necessarily imply a vast array of food types. That simply means the nutritional value of our food has to cover our needs. </p>
<p>It doesn't have to be varied. You can very well thrive by eating the same handful of things every day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Carnivore and herbivore are very general. Cows, deer, etc. will eat meat and bone to get nutrients rare in a plant based diet.  There are deer that will seek out and kill baby birds because their heads are rich in phosphorus. Only &quot;obligate&quot; carnivores eat/need only meat. Most can and will munch on some plants. </p>
<p>These animals SEEK OUT balanced diets because their main food sources don't provide full nutrients. There are reasons captive animals live longer, and one is being well fed a balanced diet.</p>
<p>Humans are animals, always keep that in mind</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One type of genetic anomaly that aided our ancestors' survival and led to us evolving to <em>Homo sapiens sapiens</em> was the elimination of most vitamin manufacturing in our cells. We only need small amounts of these nutrients, and our precursor ancestors made them. As our food sources and diets diversified and we developed better digestive systems, it was advantageous to shift the body's resources from making vitamins to other processes. By essentially moving vitamin production &quot;off-site&quot; to &quot;external suppliers&quot; (food animals &amp; plants), our internal manufacturing process got leaner and our ancestors' bodies were able to pursue innovations that increased the odds of survival past reproduction.</p>
<p>We still make our own vitamin D, but we get all of our other required vitamins from the foods we eat. Different species of plants and animals make all the different vitamins we need. The downside to this &quot;lean manufacturing&quot; is that we cannot compensate if essential nutrients are not available. Widespread disease caused terrible suffering until researchers (like Dr. Casimir Funk) proved that vitamin deficiencies were to blame. We've all heard of anemia (B12) &amp; scurvy (C <em>arrrgh!</em>), but beriberi (B1), pellagra (B3), rickets (D), and many other ailments are caused by a lack of vitamins and affect people worldwide. WHO estimates 250,000-500,000 children go blind every year due to vitamin A deficiency, and sadly half of them die within a year of going blind. In modern food processing, synthetic vitamins are added to many foods (esp those that fill supermarkets in richer nations) due to public health initiatives in the early 20th century.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It isn't. Humans can and do quite easily reach breeding age and reproduce successfully without a balanced diet, provided they have enough calories. We need to eat reasonably well to have consistently good health and live to old age, but the importance of those things is largely an emergent human/social construct. Animals in the wild aren't necessarily &quot;healthy&quot; as we define the term. Many are malnourished, have parasites, etc. Entire regional populations of some animals can be stunted and unhealthy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
