There’s no way, at 17 months old, that that is intentional, I imagine it’s more instinctual. And, tbh, when I find myself suppressing an eye roll of my own, it feels like I’m fighting a natural urge. Maybe I’m just dramatic?? Lol</p></div></div>

<p>Edit: To add to the above, OP I think you find it so instinctual because you've probably  picked up the behaviour of rolling your eyes when annoyed/frustrated from pretty early on, and have probably reinforced that by actually doing that action when feeling annoyed, frustrated, etc. At this point, it's become nearly muscle memory to you, and feels extremely instinctive. My point above wasn't to invalidate how it *feels* instinctive to you, but only to point out how this must have happened, and that it doesn't necessarily a thing in many other cultures around the world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nope, it's not. It's learned cultural behavior. South Korean culture has no eye rolling, for example.</p>
<p>So your daughter has learned it from you and your husband, or people around her.</p>
<p>edit: People who say there <em>is</em> eye rolling in Korea, you've reminded me of the big mantra in linguistics, &quot;Never say never.&quot; But people who cite Wikipedia need to read the article carefully for what constitutes facts vs opinions and read the cited sources carefully, because the sources don't say what you want them to.</p>
<p>edit: and for Korean people who know of eye rolling, how would you translate it? Because 눈알을 굴리다 describes people looking in different directions, kind of like trying to cheat in exams, not the “ugh” gesture.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if it counts as 'eye-rolling', but babies do break eye-contact when feeling overwhelmed. They can't help but process what they see, so to 'get away' they look elsewhere. Maybe eye-rolling as a cultural cue comes from that process. A mental head-shake if you will.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
