</blockquote>
<p>The hotel industry by and large hasn't seen huge consolidation.  The vast, vast majority of hotels are actually locally owned.  </p>
<p>The big hotel companies are mostly just management companies.  They don't own most of their hotels, rather, the actual owner of the hotel has hired them to come in and run the hotel for them.</p>
<p>You'd actually find that the same is true of apartments - most apartments in North America are run by a handful of companies, the same is true of the EU.  Those management companies follow the same model that big hotel chains do in that they don't actually own most of their properties, they just manage them on behalf of the real owner.  </p>
<p>The only difference is that apartment management companies tend to brand their managed properties as a local thing because people want to think that the person managing their home is someone who is local and has a vested interested in their well being such that they will provide you with a superior experience, rather than a giant, soulless corporation.</p>
<p>That's a bit different than what most people want with a hotel - which is for it to be run by a giant, soulless corporation that is going to ensure that they have a uniform, acceptable experience regardless of where they stay.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Not sure the premise is true. I'll grant that complexes are usually branded to appear distinct and independent but there are some truly enormous multi-state property management companies behind a lot of them. Apartment hunters often find that they don't have as much choice in who is on the other end of the lease than at first appeared.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>They seem a bit similar in that they both provide places for people to live, but they differ significantly in the kind of need they serve. An apartment plans to house someone for an extended period of time, years in most cases, while a hotel is only looking to house someone for days or several weeks at the longest.</p>
<p>Those differences drive the consolidation of hotels vs apartments. If someone is traveling they are going to want to stay at a hotel and it is helpful if they know what to expect. There is a certain level of service and experience that can be predicted from a hotel chain which is attractive to someone only planning to stay for a few days. If the local hotel is locally owned, operated, and branded then there is no way to predict the experience without some investigation which people don't want to do.</p>
<p>An apartment though is a long enough stay that investigation isn't an unreasonable expectation. Potential customers don't need to trust a known brand, they can investigate themselves even to the point of getting a walk-through of an example unit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its mostly perception based. But hotels and motels tend to run under one or two business models. Others exist but these are the common two.</p>
<p>The first one is based on one person owns the property and building rights and normally sublets the management rights. I may own a hotel the Marriott runs it for me. They pay me to run it but they keep the profits of running it. Under this some of the people who manage motels may franchise to get more brand recognition and other forms of support. So I own it, Person b manages it and is franchised with The Marriott so people know it's going to be of a certain standard.  </p>
<p>The other common practice for large chains is to get a company to build a building that will be used as a hotel with a prearranged lease in place. I.e I pay company x to build me a 400 room hotel and I will lease and run it for 30 years. I then either renew or vacate like you would from a rental.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
