		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, some packs are made with prismatic cells. The pros and cons of cylindrical vs prismatic cells themselves are more important than packing efficiency. Notably, cylindrical manufacturing is more mature, and cylindrical cells tend to be better (in energy density and cost per kWh) at lower capacities, which most packaged battery packs are.</p>
<p>Here's an in-depth article on the cylindrical vs prismatic question: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378775316315981" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378775316315981</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mostly historical now.</p>
<p>Originally many mass-manufactured batteries were made by rolling flat sheets of material, inserting a rod, and filling the space with an electrolyte. It made for a fairly simple method of manufacture and was pretty reliable. By rolling a sheet around a tube you easily got a known size without needing spacers and rods were pretty simple to extrude. You could also cast or extrude the tube pretty easily.</p>
<p>If you went with two flat sheets you'd need several spacers to make sure the sheet was evenly spaced all around and a flat item is less structurally-sound than a round one. Look at the strength of an arch vs the strength of a square opening. </p>
<p>In addition, you have the highest ratio of volume to surface area with a round container. But if you go with a sphere you lose a lot of volume when you pack them. It turns out that a great balance of volume to surface area and packing units comes from cylinders instead of spheres or square prisms.</p>
<p>So most battery manufacturers settled around making cylindrical batteries rather than any other shape. The exception is when you really need to maximize volume, then they go with whatever shape does that best - such as in a cell phone, you'll see that the batteries will often be a flat rectangle which uses every bit of space possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a complicated question, and the short answer is that cost, safety and efficiency are almost always more important factors than effective use of space.</p>
<p>It almost always comes down to per-unit manufacturing costs, which includes the tooling and machines to make the product or battery or costs like reject rates.</p>
<p>The notable exception to this is cell phones or other personal mobile electronics where space is a factor over almost everything else.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons they make higher capacity and amperage batteries round is entirely due to the manufacturing process.</p>
<p>So, a battery like a lithium-ion 18650 or similar is really a jelly roll of thin films, gel and metal foils stuffed into a thin metal can - or even just a foil pouch. It is an extremely high precision manufacturing process, so there needs to be an exact amount of tension on the webs of different materials that come together to be wound into the spool that becomes the core of the battery.</p>
<p>Too much tension and you can tear metal foils, squeeze out the electrolyte gel so there's not a large or safe enough gap between electrodes. Too little tension and it doesn't make full contact with itself and won't fit in the metal battery can it's designed to fit inside. (Sometimes lower capacity or cheaply made batteries have empty space in the can!)</p>
<p>And in either case if you don't get it right you have a potentially dangerous cell that could fail prematurely or even go into thermal runaway and catch fire or explode.</p>
<p>Next let's look at prismatic lithium ion and lithium polymer batteries. For most cell phone type batteries they're made with a similar wrapping and coiling process using films, gels and metal foils. Those batteries aren't actually square, they're more like squashed circles or ovals when you look at a cross section.</p>
<p>The machines used to make them need to carefully adjust and maintain wrapping tension as the flat or oblong battery core is wound as the tension needs are different at the ends as opposed to the flat parts.</p>
<p>Since the bend is tighter at the ends this introduces a stress point and point of failure, and the whole wrapping process is much more technically difficult and usually more expensive on a per battery cost.</p>
<p>So these kinds of oblong mobile electronic batteries tend to have thicker films as a safety feature, and this reduces their capacity.</p>
<p>So they're usually trading some capacity for that oblong shape and increased safety, which is why round cells can actually have higher energy density per cubic foot or weight than prismatic cells.</p>
<p>But wait, there's more! Let's look at AA, C, D and similar type cells. This battery format goes back nearly a hundred years at this point, and started with plain old zinc-carbon dry cell batteries. They don't use a roll of films like modern batteries, they use powders or pastes in a metal or even cardboard case.</p>
<p>But why are they round? Mainly because it's easier and cheaper to punch, draw and make metal shapes that are round than square or prismatic shapes. These cells also are a convenient shape for many consumer devices ranging from flashlights to portable radios.</p>
<p>Modern AAA, AA, C, D cells use either cylindrical, hollow pellets of battery chemicals or liquid gels, and using round cans means that they don't have to orient parts to match a square. All the parts in the stack are round and can go right in the can without having to have a complicated machine that lines up, say, square pellets or square seals in square cans.</p>
<p>But wait, what about other older square/prismatic batteries like the 9V, the 6V and 12V lantern batteries? What about car batteries and lead acid batteries?</p>
<p>In these cases these batteries were based on older battery chemistries that were actual &quot;piles&quot; and this is where originally get the name &quot;battery&quot; because it's a battery of plates or piles. Battery meaning a group or array of identical smaller things.</p>
<p>In these cases they were using many square plates stacked together. In original 9V batteries it was a stack of layers in that can, and similar constructions existed in 6v and 12v lantern batteries.</p>
<p>Side note: today many 9v batteries are actually 6 AAAA sized cells inside a can because it's just easier to make 6 round batteries and stuff them in a box.</p>
<p>In lead acid batteries found in cars, forklifts or older generation battery banks or backup systems, they use cast lead grid plates and battery chemistry pastes soaking in an acidic liquid or gel electrolyte.</p>
<p>They also made these batteries square because it was easiest to do for this chemistry and manufacturing process.</p>
<p>So why not use these kinds of batteries in an electric car or solar home power rig?</p>
<p>Well, they used to, and they still do. You still find them in heavy duty applications where they need a lot of reliable high amperage power where weight is less of an issue, like a forklift or the starter battery of a car.</p>
<p>But they don't use them in a Tesla because the weight to power ratio is just that much higher in a bank of 18650s or similar round batteries.</p>
<p>There's also now a lot more economic costs in manufacturing lead chemistry batteries. There's a fuckton of regulation and mandates about battery life and recycling them and so on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
