According to my allergists, I have been allergic to grass &amp; corn in my twenties, but now am allergic to grass, trees, and several food items such as wheat and walnuts, but no longer corn.  I’ve been on immunosuppressive therapies for at least 12 years, but not at times of allergy testing. Is there a link between my immune disease and the changing food allergies?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps the best defined example of a link between allergy and autoimmunity is 'atopic march'. There is a constellation of allergic/immune disorders - eczema, food allergy, seasonal allergy, asthma - where if you have one, you are at an elevated risk of developing the others. And interestingly, patients prescribed a drug to treat one of these disorders will sometimes see a lessening of symptoms in other disorders from the list.</p>
<p>At the molecular level, the atopic march connection is mostly modulated through Th2-type immune responses. </p>
<p>The case is more complex for other types of autoimmunity such as lupus, IBD or MS (and to be honest, it may even be a stretch to classify eczema or asthma as autoimmunity).</p>
<p>If you read a paper on the topic, you'll almost always find a sentence to the effect that &quot;since some point in recent history, there has been a parallel increase in allergic and autoimmune disorders&quot;. This is usually taken as evidence to support a link. And when you do things like look at genetics of people with autoimmune disease, you'll find a decent overlap compared to the genetics of people with allergic disease.</p>
<p>What this means from the molecular level is a bit more complicated, though, because autoimmunity is often mediated by Th1/Th17 signaling, and (as stated above) allergy is more of a Th2 signaling disorder. To my knowledge no one has satisfactorily worked out a molecular pathway that would link these two types of signaling. Popular theories include things like lack of exposure to germs as kids pre-disposes our immune cells to just be generally hyperactive. In my mind, it is still very much a field of active research, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, in the sense that the immune system reacts to something that is not a pathogen. In the case of an allergy this can be a protein found in certain types of food, which you can then avoid. But in autoimmune disease this protein is a normal part of healthy human cells. </p>
<p>Edit: I should probably add that the something that the immune system responds to is not necessarily a protein.</p>
<p>There is also some evidence that they have related mechanisms:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-scientists-find-link-between-allergic-autoimmune-diseases-mouse-study" target="_blank">https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-scientists-find-link-between-allergic-autoimmune-diseases-mouse-study</a></p>
<p>&quot;The results of previous research had shown that people with minor variations in the BACH2 gene often develop allergic or autoimmune diseases, and that a common factor in these diseases is a compromised immune system.&quot;</p>
<p>If you have both it could be that you have this type of mutation or one with a similar effect. But that is pure speculation on my side. I don't know how common this type of mutation is and how likely you are to have both an allergy and an autoimmune disease without these mutations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we think about allergies and autoimmune diseases we put them all under the heading of 'Hypersensitivity', which as other's have describes is the body inappropriately reacting to a non-pathogenic substance, whether it be part of the body or an allergen.</p>
<p>We then group the types of hypersensitivity reactions based on thier mechanism (using the Gell-Combs classification).</p>
<p>Type 1 - Allergies - These occur shortly after exposure to an allergen and are due to inappropriate release of histamine (and other cytokines) by Mast Cells (this is regulated by IgE, hence why Anti-IgE [Omalizumab] works). The histamine causes vasodilation, hence swelling and itching. Nuts, sea food, stings and hay fever are typical examples. Worst case scenario this causes Anaphylaxis.</p>
<p>Type 2 - Antibody Mediated - Antibodies produced by plasma cells (derived from B Cells) inappropriately target the bodies own cells, causing them to be targeted and damaged by other parts of the immune system. Typical examples include Goodpastures disease and Myasthenia Gravis.</p>
<p>Type 3 - Immune Complex Mediated - Antibodies combine with complement to form an 'immune complex', these get deposited in vessel walls and cause inflammation which over a long period of time causes damage and scarring. The best known example is SLE (lupus).</p>
<p>Type 4 - Delayed - T Cells inappropriately recognise and direct the rest of the immune system to attack the bodies own tissue (i'm a bit fuzzy about the specific immunology). Most autoimmune diseases fall into this category, e.g coeliac, T1 Diabetes, MS, contact dermatitis.</p>
<p>In terms of treatment we try to tailor it to the specific mechanism to get the best response. So for Type 1 Allergies we can give anti-histamines initially to stop the effects of the released histamine, later on we can use Anti-IgE. Neither of these will have a significant benefit for the other types of hypersensitivity.</p>
<p>With 'Immunosuppressive Therapy' mostly how this works is to stop cells replicating. It just so happens the white blood cells have one of the fastest turnover times in the body so affect on their number's is the most profound. As types 2,3 and 4 are mediated by white blood cells (or their products) these will have the best affect on these conditions.</p>
<p>There are obviously exceptions where we use therapies specific for the type which don't work in the above way, e.g Rituximab for Antibody mediated which works by knocking out a part of B cell development, and Cyclosporin for Type 4 which works by stopping the production of an important trigger for T cell activation.</p>
<p>So overall it's not unreasonable to think that because the body reacts inappropriately by one mechanism it would be more likely to also do so by others. However I doubt that the treatments or the other diseases will have an impact on your changing food allergies as they have different mechanisms.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To give a general answer, depending on the type of autoimmune disease, T or B cells from your immune system will be involved and will recognize typically proteins made within your body.  This is actually normal, and all of us have some amount of T and B cells that do this, however these self-recognizing T and B cells are trained to not trigger a reaction, for example through a process called anergy, which is one of the many mechanisms by which your body builds a tolerance to itself.  However, in the case of autoimmune disease, these tolerance processes are subverted.  However, the exact way in which they are subverted varies widely among autoimmune diseases and is at least one reason why different autoimmune diseases target different parts of the body.</p>
<p>Allergies have some similarities as noted by the other comment here in that it involves a loss of tolerance to a (typically) protein. Just in this case it is an environmental protein and not one made by your body.  However, the specific group of T or B cells involved will be different as essentially each T or B cell is genetically programmed to recognize only a single thing.  Usually the type of T cell reaction that is associated with most forms of autoimmune disease is a different form of reaction than is typically associated with most forms of allergy (you can read about Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells if you are interested to learn more).  So, the mechanisms involved for allergy versus autoimmune reactions are somewhat different.  This is also reflected in the genetics, where speaking very broadly most of the genetic risk factors tend to be different (though there are examples otherwise as discussed in the other comment).  To give a very broad summary, while there are some similarities in the loss of tolerance that occurs, the type of reaction and the mechanism of loss of tolerance generally tend to be different for the two forms of disease.  Thus, while there can be links between the two processes in the same individual, these links will be mostly indirect and difficult to formulate clearly in most cases.</p>
<p>Note that the impact of immunosuppressive therapies on development of additional forms of allergy or autoimmune disease can be complex as, depending on the specific therapy, some may target regulatory cells that act to suppress inappropriate immune reactions in addition to suppressing the overall immune response.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is just from experience, I found out I was type 1 diabetic at 17, and I did a clinical trial for some pancreas drugs. And one of the doctors always asked every time I saw them (every two weeks) was if I had eczema.  Granted that’s not an allergy, but like super dry skin.  Yes I did have it . I always wondered if it was correlated. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
