Some other disease specific treatments exist but none are curative.    An exciting new treatment is the FcRn inhibitor, which induces IgG degradation.   Unfortunately most patients are not cured by these and many are on steroids for life (steroids suck) </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To truly cure this general class of disease, you’d have to find a way to eliminate or control the memory t-cells that recognize the self antigen (different for every auto immune disease). You might want to look into the T-reg work being done  at Sonoma Biotherapeutics.</p>
<p>This paper explains the theory behind their work:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of good answers here. I concur that we haven’t cured any autoimmune diseases.</p>
<p>One positive step that occurred in the last 20 years, though, has been the development of “biologic” drugs. Monoclonal antibodies that can be used to target key proteins in the immune system. For many autoimmune diseases, these are the first treatments that are genuinely effective and aren’t just masking symptoms. For many patients they can halt the progression of their disease for years or even decades.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is no. Think of what it would take to “cure” an autoimmune disease - you would have to eradicate a part of your own immune system. Very hard to do this and not eradicate the good parts as well. Currently, we do not have that specificity or that type of weapon. This is complicated by the fact that the immune system “remembers” what it had attacked in the past (B lymphocytes). These cells survive for decades. This is why it is considered remission and not cured. Same for cancer. It’s impossible to know if you’ve cleared every last cell or not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Autoimmune disorders are a heterogenous group; however, there are curative treatments for a small subset of them. One example is cancers of the immune system, such as leukemia and lymphoma, which can be cured using a bone marrow transplant. Doctors use chemotherapy and radiation to wipe out the dysfunctional immune system and then re-start the immune system from scratch by transplanting healthy immune progenitor cells (which originate in the bone marrow). If the bone marrow transplant is successful, the patient will go into remission with a healthy immune system. While there is always a chance of a relapse, the patient could legitimately be considered “cured.” Bone marrow transplant has significant risks and long term effects which is why it is not commonly used to treat other autoimmune disorders.</p>
<p>Additionally, new medications exist that help slow the progression of autoimmune diseases. They do not cure the disease, but they do more than manage symptoms. These medications are called immunosuppressants and include prescriptions such as rituximab. Immunosuppressants also have significant side effects including a higher risk of infection, but they have been a game changer for many patients with autoimmune disorders.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
