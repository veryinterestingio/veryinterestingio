		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m a TV accountant.  Most everyone is paid hourly.  Directors are paid by the project.  Actors can be paid a day rate, weekly rate or episodic rate.  Some jobs, accountants, costume designers, set decorators are paid a weekly “on call” rate.</p>
<p>Checks are due the Thursday after shooting (or Friday if you’re on location.)</p>
<p>The studio doesn’t take anything!  That’s crazy.</p>
<p>Residuals and merchandising are depending on the contract.</p>
<p>Payment to writers, directors and actors are usually sent to their agent who takes 10% and sends the rest to their client.  Crew checks are handed out on set or mailed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I work as a freelance cameraman and also work parttime for a company as a cameraman.</p>
<p>Usually there’s a production house or company that does the production. They hire and pay the crew. Maybe there’s a director in-house. The producers are usually in-house so they have salaries. The rest of the crew usually works with day rates. So let’s say a movie takes 14 days to shoot. They send an invoice of their day rate x14.</p>
<p>On long projects that last multiple weeks I might send multiple invoices to get paid in parts.</p>
<p>Most of the people are freelancers who just get hired. In terms of equipment. Most of the gear will be rented from a camera rental company and that invoice also gets paid by the production company. Including all extra expenses like food, travel costs etc etc etc.</p>
<p>In the end everything is paid for by production. From preproduction to shoot to edit. All expenses go through the producer/production company.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actor/artist here. The answer is always, &quot;it depends.&quot;</p>
<p>First, you have the studio that wants a movie. For this example, let's say Universal wants to make Ryan Reynolds Walks Away From Cars in Slow Motion. And it's just a movie of Ryan Reynolds walking away from cars in slow motion. Awesome. Ryan Reynolds pitched it. Or a writer sold the script to a production company and the studio said, &quot;yes!&quot; Something like that.</p>
<p>They'll team up with a production studio to actually produce the film. Let's say Hot &amp; Sexy Pictures is going to produce the film.</p>
<p>Every production puts together a budget to start. There are &quot;below the line&quot; staff. Art department, costumes, crew, production, lighting, post production, the person who coifs Ryan Reynold's hair. These are the people who, though their work is extraordinary valuable and amazing, are replaceable. You don' t lose a shoot day if you can't get the same grip two days in a row or if your VFX house quits on you. Generally the crew and artists are paid through a payroll company who makes sure they have a check every week. Productions will often use payment processing companies to deal with their payments/checks. But that's how they get paid. If it's a nice union shoot, you'll often hear stories of people on set getting paid more if the shoot goes longer. Double time after 10 hours. Golden Time after 16 where you're getting paid an insane amount. Sometimes you're paid a salary. That's a guaranteed amount up to a 12 hour day. So if you work 3 hours or 12 hours, you get the same amount.</p>
<p>Then there are the &quot;above the line&quot; costs. These are the people who cannot be replaced (well, easily). Ryan Reynolds walking away from cars in slow motion wouldn't work if they replaced him with Steven Segal. You can't just replace Michael Bay with Tommy Wiseau. Other players above the line would include your director, editor, writer, director of photography (DP), producer. Most of the unions in this world will make sure everyone is paid a base amount. But if they have agents, as most will, their costs may vary. SAG scale for a film is something like $63,000 for a starring role. Day players, costars, guest stars, featuring, smaller role actors like me generally get a different day rate and are paid within 60 days. But for the leads it's different. And generally you're paid after (unless your agent negotiates different). But Ryan's agents can say to the studio, &quot;he'll easily bring in $20 million on advertising himself shirtless in front of an explosion. Therefore he requires $10 million at least.&quot; The director can say the same. The producer, dp, editor can have a great track record and negotiate their earnings based on their track record or desirability.  So they're paid a base amount, but may earn more if their record, work, perceived value is higher.</p>
<p>During these negotiations, you may hear of these guys negotiating &quot;points.&quot; These are percentages points of a film. So say Ryan says, &quot;I'll just earn $1 million to save on your budget to start, but I'll take 10% of the film's gross profit.&quot; Well, if the film earns a billion dollars, Ryan walks away with $100 million dollars. If it's gross profit (basically all the money that came into their hands), he's great. If it's net profit (profit after all expenses are paid), you'll hear of people getting screwed out of money. &quot;Sure, we earned a billion dollars. But that was at least... uh.... let me make up a number here... $999 million in costs?&quot; 10% of a million is a lot different from 10% of a billion. And those will get paid out generally within a certain period of time required by their contracts or law. So when you hear of Jack Nicholson making $50 million off of Batman, or Keanu making $100 million off the Matrix, it's usually because of a deal like that.</p>
<p>As an actor, I'll get something called &quot;Residuals.&quot; Say I have one line as Ryan's chest waxer in the film. I get paid for the day. And because I'm in a union, I'm required to be paid a percentage of the earnings. Only a much, much, much smaller percentage. Say the movie airs all over HBO after its theatrical run. I'll get paid a small amount for every airing. So I could see myself getting paid thousands on top of what I already earned. Or, for something I did years ago, I might just make a few cents for an airing in Australia at 2am. Writers often have this same deal. A lot of people will think that's kind of ridiculous. But, it's how we earn our money. As an actor, if I were paid $30/hr to be on set on a feature film, that'd sound great to anyone else! But that might just be 2 days on set. We could go a whole year without acting on camera after that. Years of theatrical training and auditioning for free at my expense to only be hired for a scene in NCIS. The industry is set up for us to not work consistently. So, that's why we get paid in a non-traditional way.</p>
<p>The production company itself isn't paid every week. Generally they'll work out a deal of how they're paid. Often it's something like 50% up front, payments after certain parts of delivery, then the rest upon delivery. Then they have to make sure the bills are paid, but still are responsible for delivering the final product.</p>
<p>And, it is Hollywood. You'll hear a lot of weird stories. Like that one of Kal Penn getting paid in a sack of cash. That's not the norm.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Film crew gets paid like any other job, generally with a paycheck and time cards. The top-billed people usually have a base amount they get paid, plus percentages if their name matters. Production companies get fat checks to pay everything for the studio.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nice this is something I can answer! I work as a camera assistant in tv and film in NYC.</p>
<p>So all productions are run as an individual business. That is, if I am hired by a show that  airs on Netflix or HBO I'm not paid by Netflix or HBO, but through payroll by the corporation created for that production. For example, I did a few seasons of Orange is the New Black and my employer was &quot;Lady Prison Productions.&quot; But technically on my tax returns, my employer is really the payroll company Entertainment Partners. </p>
<p>So at the end of the year when I get my W2s, I get one for each payroll company. So even though I worked on OITNB, The Deuce, and Succession in 2018, they were all paid through the same payroll company and the income from all of those shows appears on one W2.</p>
<p>As far as the wages, I am a member of a union, International Cinematographers Guild Local 600. They negotiate rates with producers to determine scale rates depending on the project. So a movie of a certain low budget can work on a &quot;tier contract&quot; and pays their technicians less hourly than a $30 million movie under the &quot;majors contract&quot; aka &quot;the basic agreement.&quot; Under most contracts the first eight hours are paid at straight time, the next four are paid at 1.5x and anything after 12 hours is paid at double time. So as a 2nd Assistant Cameraman I am making about $50/hour at straight time, but for a 14 hour day it's really 8 + (1.5 x 4) + (2 x 2) so paid effectively 18 hours. 12 hours is a normal day although it really varies show to show-- Blue Bloods we averaged 9 or 10 hours but I just did a pilot where the shortest day was 14.</p>
<p>My expertise is with the &quot;below the line&quot; technicians (basically everyone except actor writer director producer) so I'll leave it at that. Hope that helps on that front :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
