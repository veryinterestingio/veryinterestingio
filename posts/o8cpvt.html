	<title>ELI5 Why, when making a caffeinated drink, we use leaves from some plants (with tea or maté) but for coffee we take the berry? Why not coffee leaves or tea berries? Is it the respectively best way to get the most caffeine/flavor or is it just historical?</title>

<p>Edit: thanks for all the up votes and awards.
Also, many people saying a potato is not a root. In reply I would say that to a 5 year old they are.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Maybe people missed the 'GOOD PART OF THE PLANT' part? Plants have many parts, some are good for humans, some are not.
Some cactus is amazing, but don't eat the spines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>you CAN drink the tea made by extracting the dried cherry flesh.   it's called Cascara.   it's ..   erm.   it is.    it's like drinking the most tannic tea you've ever tried, tastes somewhat like cherry, and has a mild caffeine buzz to it. </p>
<p>the Seed however is what was initially drunk, because if you leave coffee cherries out in the sun for a few days, you'll end up with a pile of dried coffee beans (or, more correctly, a pile of green coffee beans.).   the thing is though, they dont really keep all that well, unless you wash the cherry flesh off first.  </p>
<p>it's not too difficult to see that someone, in an attempt to speed up the drying process accidentally dry roasted a pile of beans..</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You <em>can</em> indeed prepare leaves from coffee plants in the exact same way and steep them, which gives you &quot;coffee tea&quot;.  It tastes much more like tea than anything like coffee.  The oils and flavorful compounds that make coffee taste like coffee just aren't in the leaves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
