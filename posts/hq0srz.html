<p>Longer answer: they look at past demand, forecasted demand (from a variety of statistical data sets), and adjust production to <em>hopefully</em> have ”just enough” (or slightly ”too much”) product when it eventually becomes saleable </p>
<p>Yes - it's a multi-year investment</p>
<p>Yes - it's risky</p>
<p>But <em>also</em> yes - as long as they guess right <em>enough</em>, it's highly profitable </p>
<p>And, of course, they can decide to sell something as a ”special edition” if market conditions change</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd also add that Jack ages for 7 years in the <em>cask</em>. In the bottle it doesn't age. But it lasts. So just because a 7 year whiskey has been bottled doesn't mean it needs to be sold right away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't always. One of the reasons for the price of Japanese whisky shooting up over the last decade is due to a huge increase in popularity a lot of the older whiskies ran out. That is why you see 'distillers cuts' or 'distillers blends' coming out from Yamazaki and others. It's mixes of what's left while more whisky is ageing.
When it comes to Jack Daniels the laws governing Tennessee Whisky require a minimum 4 years ageing. However, Jack Daniels will have reserves of whisky anyway to blend into each batch to ensure consistency of flavour. Basically they make a shitload and anything they don't sell they just keep to blend later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>For volume, we look at market trend and operational capacity (how much we can make and store). If the market will demand something above our capacity, we build more warehouses and invest in increasing Distillery capacity. </p>
<p>For new spirits and trends, we can either innovate at the front end (using different grain and things to change the flavor before barreling) or back end (things to change the flavor after the barrel). Front end innovation relies on future marketing to make it a new product while back end innovation can be more reactive to trends.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, either they made too much, 8 years ago, in which case they can advertise more, and possibly reduce prices (supermarkets love their 3 for the price of 2 offers), in an attempt to increase demand.</p>
<p>Or they made too little - good news, they get to sell all of what they produced. That was the goal. If it is particularly fine, they can maybe charge slightly more for it, and still sell it all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
