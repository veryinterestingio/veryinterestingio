		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Julius Caesar’s book ‘Commentary on the Gallic War’ he describes exactly how they built a bridge across the Rhine. This was in 55BC and again in 53BC. First one took him 10 days and the second ‘a few days’. They both managed to get his Legions to the other side and back.</p>
<p>This is the wiki entry but I’d highly recommend the book as a whole if you’re interested in many other military engineering feats. The Roman engineers were masters and very quick!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, the same way they are built now.  It just took more time and more people/animal power.</p>
<p>You can build up for bridges over rivers or relatively shallow canyons.  Sink some supports, add scaffolding and start laying masonry or building wooden tresses on top on your supports.  For longer expanses, just treat each completed section as the new bank and start another section further out.  Build a cofferdam or (partially) divert the river during construction if needed/desired.</p>
<p>You can build out for bridges over deeper canyons.  Pass some ropes from one bank to another.  Use these to support people and wooden frames as you build from one bank to another.  Eventually you have either a wooden bridge or a frame to start laying masonry.</p>
<p>These processes can also happen incrementally over hundreds of years.  It might start with a rope bridge to allow traders to periodically ford a river.  Later, a town improves this crossing by building a wooden bridge, allowing oxcarts to more easily traverse.  Even later a local lord wanting to show his largesse or improve transit for his armed forces, replaces the wooden bridge with stonework.  In each case, the older bridge can be used to help construct the new one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
