There is also a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/07/09/739874122/toxic-algae-bloom-closes-25-beaches-on-mississippis-coast-fed-by-fresh-floodwate" target="_blank">large toxic algal bloom in the Gulf Coast</a> which has shut down all the beaches in Mississippi and a dozen beaches in Louisiana. Additionally, a toxic algal bloom has been seen in <a href="http://ldh.la.gov/index.cfm/newsroom/detail/5177" target="_blank">Lake Pontchartrain</a>. What happens if Barry hits New Orleans and the city floods with this water? Does it create additional hazards and if so how do public health and emergency services recommend citizens respond? Relatedly, with all of this rain should we expect these agal blooms to grow? Or do huge storms like hurricanes disrupt this?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This actually happened on the Adriatic coasts last year. Toxic algae reproduced more than usual during the summer and then a medicane came in september. Okay, I know, mediterranean storms aren't as bad as the ones you get in the Gulf of Mexico coast, but it's the same principle here. It did produce waves high enough to reach and flood coastal cities, though the flooding was mostly from rain water.</p>
<p>Don't worry, it's not going to kill everyone in town. Apulians are still alive and healthy.</p>
<p>A lot of people confuse <em>toxic</em> and <em>infectious.</em> These algae are not infectious, in the sense that they don't reproduce inside the host's body. Ingesting small amounts may be below the dangerous doses and not get you sick. Also since the water that reaches the city is so diluted by rainwater, it's far less dangerous than sea water.</p>
<p>Even so, several beaches were closed last summer, but we were still allowed to swim in areas where concentration was lower precisely because small amounts are not dangerous.</p>
<p>Sources of tap water may be contaminated and you may be required to buy bottled water for both cooking and drinking. Your government is supposed to provide official advise if that happens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I knew people in uni who worked purifying anatoxin-a for the pharmaceutical industry. I also took some courses in limnology with special attention to the science of death-algae.</p>
<p>Algae can make a variety of toxins. These are not health guru &quot;toxins&quot; - these are honest technical toxins and if you purify them the LD50 can be in micrograms so if you've touched enough pure anatoxin-a to see you are probably dead. Cytotoxins, neurotoxins, it's a toxin buffet.</p>
<p>How do you tell if algae is toxic by looking at it? You can't! Even under a microscope toxic and less-toxic spirulina look the same. Should you or your pets touch it? <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3798876/" target="_blank">No!</a> This won't literally kill you if you swim in caked dense algae, right? <a href="https://journalstar.com/news/science/deadly-waters-teen-s-death-a-wake-up-call-about/article_6937c85b-a6b9-5a71-9e6b-a3e56fa9d73e.html" target="_blank">Sometimes it will!</a> Light exposure will probably just make you slightly sick and isn't necessarily a big deal.</p>
<p>Spirulina (the stringy green freshwater to brackish kind) likes shallow, stagnant, warm, high coastline to volume ratio bodies of water, agricultural and lawn care fertilizer runoff, and CO2. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/climate-change-and-harmful-algal-blooms" target="_blank">U.S. EPA on climate change and toxic algae.</a></p>
<p>Vast amounts of agricultural runoff coming down the Mississippi causes perpetual hypereutrophic (algae overgrowth) conditions in Lake Ponchetrain and the nearby Gulf. Getting rid of toxic algae often requires changes to how people live and how they use water. The right time to panic was about ten or twenty years ago.</p>
<p>Also mind the <a href="https://moldpedia.com/black-mold-symptoms" target="_blank">mental and physical effects of black drywall mold</a> in the aftermath of a flood. I probably inhaled more of that than was good for me during Katrina cleanup. Breathing masks are really uncomfortable in New Orleans heat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Harmful Algal Blooms are a problem for swimmers.</p>
<p>But I would bet the hurricanes affect would result in a dilution of the toxins concentration to a dose that would be a negligable risk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
