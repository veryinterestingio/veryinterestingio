&quot;So, in summary, binaural beats certainly do not work the way the sellers claim, but there's no reason to think they're any less effective than any other music track you might listen to that effects you in a way you like.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Also, changing the tuning of middle A doesn't make the music &quot;resonate with the natural frequency of your body.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Theres nothing too crazy about binaural beats. The name gives off the vibe that it messes with your mind in some way.
Its a sonic occurrence when you have to two low-frequency sine waves that are slightly out of tune from each other. For example, if you have one sine wave at C1(~32Hz) and a second playing at B0(~30Hz), you hear a combination tone the same that you would hear any two notes being played at the same time. The difference is that because lower notes and therefore lower frequencies have longer wavelengths, you’re able to distinguish the peaks and valleys that are being created through the sound going in and pit of phase much easier than you would be at a higher frequency range.   Brain music on the other hand is a much more broad term that could mean anything from lower case music (drones/ambience/binaural beats/etc...) to meditation style musics. The difference is that binaural/isochronic/brain music is mostly placebo while traditional meditation music (singing bowls, easy listening, yoga music) is good for relaxing. </p>
<p>My personal thoughts to why binaural beats are consistently thought of to have certain ‘powers’ in the mind is that it IS a strange sound for people who don’t hear it often. And typically when you have a sound system that can faithfully produce low frequencies, you get a more powerful sound being produced. (Feeling your headphones, or seeing your speaker cone vibrate)
But just the same as standard music, you shouldn’t be listening to it at an unreasonable volume because you CAN damage your hearing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
