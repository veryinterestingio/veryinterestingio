		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Believe it or not, there were no &quot;Plagues&quot; to catch!</p>
<p>(A YouTuber by the name of CPGGrey did a video on this, called &quot;Americapox: The Missing Plague&quot;. This comment is based on that research.)</p>
<p>Most of the bad diseases are zoonotic, which means they're originally animal diseases which learn to live inside humans. These diseases are so deadly because they think they're inside of animals. A disease doesn't want to kill its host, but instead, keep the host alive and reproduce inside of it. When zoonotic diseases do what would be &quot;normal&quot; inside of a cow or pig, it can kill a human. </p>
<p>In Afro-Eurasia, there were several different types of livestock! There were pigs, cows, chickens, horses, sheep, lots of species which we raised in large concentrations, in unsanitary conditions. This is the perfect opportunity for a zoonotic disease to 'jump' from animals to humans. That's what happened with SARS and the H1N1 Virus, for some modern examples.</p>
<p>What livestock exists on the American continents? Really only llamas and alpacas. Because of a few reasons, it was difficult to raise these species in industrial quantities. Without the huge concentrations of these animals, there was almost no opportunity for zoonotic disease to spread to humans in the first place!</p>
<p>TL;DR: The really terrible diseases are the ones that humans catch from livestock. The American Continents didn't raise livestock in the same way that Europeans did, and therefore didn't have any plagues to transmit!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They did.  Very notably is syphilis.</p>
<p>As for the reason for the disparity: Europeans were more technologically advanced and had widespread agriculture and animal husbandry meaning that more diseases had already developed and spread over the millennia.  American Indians at the time the Europeans arrived were predominantly hunters and gatherers and had not developed agriculture or animal husbandry to the same level, so fewer diseases were commonplace.</p>
<p>So when Europeans showed up and diseases started spreading, they didn't understand why normal non-fatal diseases were suddenly killing people.  A few hundred years later, the germ theory of disease came around and explained it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It only seems to be, but it happened a lot! Just like today when you go on vacation across the world i.e. tropical areas if you are not from there. </p>
<p>The reason they brought back less misery then they spread is the factors of reproduction for diseases. Its about traffic essentially. People went with unharmful diseases, but the natives who caught the diseases have high amount of traffic among them. So disease spreads easily because once settled on a continent it has free play. Other way around it is harder. The relatively few people who were there would probably get very  ill and die while on the continent and/or would not survive the long way home. This made it harder for diseases to travel back. Also being on a boat for several months is a good quarantine measure. Those who survived would be immune for some type of diseases.</p>
<p>Were it by any chance be the other way around and Americas or oversea asian societies would colonise Europe with large armies you would probably have seen the same pattern but other way around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
