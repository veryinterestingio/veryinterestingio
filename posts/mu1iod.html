		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Salt has a number of effects on the perception of taste beyond simply tasting salty:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/14042126_Salt_enhances_flavour_by_suppressing_bitterness_5" target="_blank">The presence of salt suppresses the bitter taste receptors on your tongue</a>. The mechanism isn't well understood, but if you have a dish that's a little bit sweet and a little bit bitter, and you add some salt, the bitterness will diminish and the sweetness will be intensified. This is actually why there's so much sodium in caffeinated soft drinks...caffeine is a bitter molecule, and the sodium stops your tongue from tasting how bitter the caffeine really is. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK50958/" target="_blank">Salt can also mask some metallic or &quot;off notes&quot;.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/143/3609/967https://science.sciencemag.org/content/143/3609/967" target="_blank">Sodium ions seem to stimulate a slight &quot;sweet&quot; taste when hydrated.</a> This may have to do with the way that water molecules clump around sodium ions...the sweet receptors on your tongue respond to hydrogen atoms on the surface of sugar molecules, and sometimes the hydrogen of water molecules clumped around a Na+ ion can be the right distance apart and trigger a &quot;sweet&quot; sensation too.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK50958/" target="_blank">Salt also affects the perception of the texture of dishes, making watery dishes feel more &quot;thick&quot;</a>. This also is poorly understood, and isn't <em>exactly</em> the same as affecting its taste or flavor, but it does alter one's overall enjoyment of their meal.</li>
</ul>
<p>When chefs talk about &quot;bringing out the flavor&quot;, however, I think they're mostly referring to the first bullet point. By suppressing any faint bitterness or metallic/off tastes in a dish, the more pleasant tastes and flavors can be more fully experienced and enjoyed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OK, I'm not going to argue with the other respondents; and I think that u/djublonskopf is pretty much correct in what they're saying. </p>
<p>However, delving a little deeper into the science, I was taught some years ago that the reason food tastes better with even a pinch of salt is that sodium is necessary to allow taste cells to do their thing:</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2202-10-20" target="_blank">&quot;taste cells depolarize, activate voltage-gated sodium channels, and fire action potentials in response to tastants. Initial cell depolarization is attributable to sodium influx through TRPM5 in sweet, bitter, and umami cells....&quot;</a></p>
<p>The theory suggested that if there are few sodium ions present to influx into the taste cells through sodium channels from the extracellular environment (the food and saliva in the mouth), overall tastes will be blunted due to that lack of sodium. The presence sodium significantly boosts pleasant tastes like umami and sweet, and turns down bitter. Sour is an exception, it uses a different ion. </p>
<p>This is old info though, I don't know where the science has gone from there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different flavors, when combined, affect how strongly they are perceived because our taste receptors are actually more complex than the old understanding of separate receptors for each major class of flavor. For salt specifically, it makes umami flavor seem stronger even though they are distinct flavors and it also reduces the perception of bitterness, which has the same effect of magnifying sweetness if your dish has both bitter and sweet present. Other physical factors also play a role here as well, e.g., salty flavor decreases with higher temperature and I think bitter perception also decreases with cold temperature.</p>
<p>I unfortunately don't know the anatomy/physiology of this, so I can't say whether salt is making those other flavors bind differentially to the receptors or whether the binding stays the same but the perception/signal from binding both is synergistic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
