		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physics and cost.</p>
<p>The theoretical efficiency limit is 95%. This is solely determined by the temperature of the sun and the temperature of earth. Whatever you do, a higher efficiency is never possible.</p>
<p>However, there are a couple of limitations. First, the solar panel has to <em>send out</em> light as well: the temperature of the panel is above absolute zero, so it emits heat. This brings it down to 86.8%. But that assumes that the incoming light comes from every direction at once. In practice, the sun only covers a small part of the sky, bringing it even further down to 68.7%. And that's still with a perfect solar cell! That assumes the cell is infinitely thick and has zero losses.</p>
<p>If we try to actually build cells, the best we can currently do is around 44.4%, which isn't too bad! But those cells consist of multiple layers, use exotic materials, and are very expensive to construct. It is <em>way</em> cheaper to construct less complicated cells. Turns out we don't really care about the absolute efficiency: there is plenty of sunlight available. We just want the most power at the lowest cost.</p>
<p>The most common (and cheapest) cell type is &quot;single-junction&quot;. The theoretical efficiency limit for those is 33.16%. Then we have some losses due to the protective coating, the wiring, being unable to cover 100% of the panel with cells, and loooots of other small stuff.</p>
<p>So yeah, it might not sound like much, but an efficiency in the 20ish% isn't too bad. Don't expect anything over 30% soon, because we're already rapidly approaching the limits of physics!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main comment doesn’t mention WHY the single junction architecture cuts the theoretical efficiency down so much, so let’s talk about that a little in 5 year old terms.</p>
<p>Solar cells work when a photon of light hits a semiconductor and knocks an electron across an electrical junction. This electron now takes on the energy that gained by crossing the junction, and this is the amount of energy that takes from the photon.</p>
<p>But different colors of light have a different amount of energy, the violet and blue ones have the most, the red ones have the least. However, the junction has a single energy level. If a photon that has exactly the same amount of energy as the junction hits, all of its energy is converted to electricity. But most of the photons have more or less. If they have less, then they can’t hit an electron over the junction. And they can’t “gang up” either—no matter how many lower energy photons hit, they can’t knock the electron. So ALL of the energy from those photons is lost. Now if a photon has more energy, then it will hit the electron over, but it only turns the energy of the junction into electricity. The “extra” is lost. So these two factors greatly lower the theoretical efficiency.</p>
<p>If the junction energy is too high, you will lose too many electrons that can’t activate an electron. If it is too low, you will lose too much energy from the photons you do get. In the case of silicon, the junction energy is pretty low, in the red region. So you get most of your photons but they are mostly cut off in energy. But most photons are in the green region and there are a lot more red photons than blue so it’s a decent compromise. Plus it’s an easy material to work with.</p>
<p>Now, you can raise the theoretical, and therefore the practical, efficiency tremendously by having multiple semiconductor types each with their own junction energy. You arrange them so that the photons are likely to be absorbed in the region that has a junction energy that closely matches the photon energy. So you maximize the number of photons you get AND the energy you get from each photon. But these are harder and more expensive to make, so since we have tons of land to put solar on, making efficiency a lower priority than price, we don’t use those much. However in cases where efficiency is supreme, such as spacecraft, these are used.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My physics teacher explained this to me and im basically 5 so here goes.</p>
<p>The easist explanation she gave was to think about it like this. If friction, heat or even sound is generated,  energy is lost. Energy goes into making those instead of into making electricity. Sunlight's hot right? Solarpanels heating up mean that energy is lost because that energy that was supposed to be converted into electrical energy becomes heat energy instead. Solarpanels also cant capture all the energy from the sun because some hit it at the wrong angle, or get messed up by the clouds. Like a big net trying to catch balls being thrown at it, but the gaps in the net are sometimes big enough for a ball to slip through.</p>
<p>90% is also a really high number for efficiency. Someone in class asked the same thing. Even gas cars dont have that. we could solve our energy crisis with an engine like that. If you knew a way, youd easily become the richest man on earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main issue is that its extremely difficult to build a single thing that can interact with the entire electromagnetic spectrum at once. Just like how your eyes cannot detect infrared or ultraviolet light.</p>
<p>To make them detect that sort of light, we'd have to add entirely different components. That would make the entire thing more expensive and bigger. And we would have to keep adding more components and making it more expensive and larger for each one.</p>
<p>Its not at all cost effective to do any of this. And that's even without the increased cost of manufacturing them, installing them and servicing them.</p>
<p>Until we come up with a way of dealing with this issue, We'll never be able to get those very high numbers.</p>
<p>And even then, we're still only able to get sunlight from a very small part of the sky. Anything but direct sunlight drastically reduces how much it can convert. Systems that track the sun are an improvement, but not a solution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
