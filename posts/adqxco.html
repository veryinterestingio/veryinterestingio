<ol>
<li>Develop a preferred direction of locomotion (increased efficiency, reduced energy costs)</li>
<li>Concentrate sensory equipment in direction of travel (better risk assessment )</li>
<li>Concentrate neural processing close to the sensors (shorter transmission paths for faster reaction times)</li>
</ol>
<p>This is encephalisation, and is why pretty much everything multicellular has an identifiable 'head' end (leaving out radial symmetry beasties like starfish).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the main problem you're coming up against is that you're using an inappropriate set of relationships to think about the evolution of nervous systems. 'Invertebrate' isn't terribly meaningful, though 'vertebrate' is okay but a touch arbitrary.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>An example to explain - we are vertebrates but at a cellular level our nervous systems are more similar to echinoderms like starfish than they are to insects because we are more closely related to echinoderms than we are to insects. Both echinoderms and insects would be classed as 'invertebrates' though insects have clearly-defined brains while starfish don't. There's an interesting question here - did echinoderms lose their brains or did brains evolve twice, once in vertebrates and once in insects? I'm not sure of the answer to that but I suspect that some people have a fairly solid idea based on genetic and protein sequence evidence.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I suspect that as a culture we get a bit too hung up on the brain as a concept and this can blind us to the underlying systems and their evolution. As far as I know a brain is a way to put the bulk of your nervous system in one place so that it is closer to your quick-acting sensory systems and can be more easily defended. It's easy to imagine that kind of strategy evolving several times given that all nervous systems we know about seem to share a common origin (though there is a group of scientists in Florida who will disagree and present the comb jelly as their case, but that's a different discussion).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's my understanding that our modern nervous system, where cells can quickly exchange molecules with other cells at a distance, evolved from an earlier paracrine system where cells could only exchange molecules with their neighbours. Sponges still are able to move around and react to their environment using a paracrine system and they use quite a few of the same molecules and proteins to do this despite not having a single nerve to their taxon. Paracrine systems probably evolved from even earlier systems to dispose of excess ions like calcium building up within a cell, a bit like what our kidneys do. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So while there may be very different structural differences between our brains and the brains of other animals, the underlying systems are remarkably similar because those were laid down before the big divergences into different animal phyla. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of great answers here, but there is one thing that I haven't seen mentioned yet. The example creatures you are using don't have &quot;brains.&quot; They have clusters of neurons called &quot;ganglia&quot; which is what brains are made of, but what you think of as a &quot;brain&quot; doesn't exist in the insect world. It's more like a &quot;proto-brain&quot; as while sure it's a cluster of neurons, it is both structurally and anatomically nothing like the brains of more complex creatures that have more sophisticated nervous systems, and function differently. And as mentioned already, processing power is often distributed in these creatures instead of focusing on purely the ganglia.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Insect brains are not homologous to vertebrate brains.  They always got big because they have to process info from a special sense, like smell or vision, and don't have a thalamus, medulla, frontal lobe, language areas, etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
