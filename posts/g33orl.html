		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At birth it’s literally a hole going into your abdomen, so the reason it doesn’t heal and become perfectly smooth is the same reason any deep scar tissue wouldn’t become smooth - although there are plenty of variations in belly buttons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your navel area includes ligaments and other tissues in addition to skin, and that skin is also thicker than the surrounding skin that overlays your abdominal muscles.</p>
<p>So, it <em>is</em> healed, but the skin is sitting on top of something structurally different than other areas of skin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I once dated a girl who had a transplant of some sort when she was a baby and didn't have a belly button because of it. You could still see scars, but it was a bit disconcerting at first to see it missing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because there was never skin there before. If it had been just skin before it was a tube, then maybe it could go back to being normal, but if there wasn't any skin there, only a tube, then it would be hard for the skin to grow over that area.  The skin is good at knitting together cuts and thin wounds, but large cuts and holes actually need stitches to heal properly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It goes down to the muscle. If you were to peel back the fat over the abs, you'd see that the navel is anchored to the abs. </p>
<p>I took a class for embalmer school where we had to dissect real human cadavers for medical study. They were embalmed and acquired from the state anatomical board. We would cut around the navel like a cookie cutter and you could see how it went all the way down to the muscle almost. </p>
<p>If you aren't squeamish, you can also see this in a video of a tummy tuck, when they reconstruct the navel by using the original. There will be blood and surgery and all that stuff so proceed with caution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
