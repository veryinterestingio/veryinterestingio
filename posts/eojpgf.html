However, to an ignorant fool like me, depressurization sounds like a good thing. It seems to me if there is less pressure then there would be a less forceful eruption. But it seems like I'm wrong and I would like to learn why.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think about what happens when you have a bottle of carbonated water that has been shaken, and you try to open it gently. When the bottle is sealed, the contents is under pressure, and thus stable.</p>
<p>Now you slightly unscrew the cap so that the over pressure can start to equalize. Some of the carbon dioxide dissolved in the liquid will start to escape and form gas bubbles when the pressure drops. Since a gas is much less dense than a liquid, these will quickly rise to the top and escape out through the opening in the cap. However, if the amount of gas that escapes is large enough, the temporary increase in volume will force the liquid all the way up to the cap and, if you're not fast enough in your reactions to screw it back in place, will cause the water to spray out. If you're fast enough, the liquid settles back down, and you can repeat the process until the pressure is equalized to the outside.</p>
<p>In both cases the end result is a completely un-pressurized container of water. But in the first case, you will get sprayed by some of it due to the violent manner of depressurization.</p>
<p>Now imagine the water is molten rock and shit, and the bottle is as large as a mountain, and someone just unscrewed the cap slightly.....</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: Clarified the conversion from dissolved carbon dioxide to gas a bit, to make it a bit more accurate and less hand-wavy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a question of time-scales - you are correct, long-term, macro-view pressure release on a volcanic system is the natural conclusion. However what they are concerned about here is that the ground fissures are evident of a large amount of magma below the surface (yet extremely shallow compared to it's origin) which poses an imminent explosive risk to the surrounding populace.</p>
<p>Also, pressure isn't always the reason for explosive eruptions, the geochemical makeup of the magma and its resultant hydrodynamic properties coupled with the cone structure play a huge part of how the pressure is released from a system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depressurizing doesn't equal depressurizing. You have to distinguish between letting pressure out in a controlled fashion and letting pressure out at an increasingly high rate. And when talking volcanoes, there's no such thing as 'controlled':</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>As u/TaazDingo noted, you can imagine a magma chamber like a shaken soda or champagne bottle. When the cork is popped, the gas can escape and rapidly incites more gas to free itself in the process - you get a runaway reaction that carries a lot of champagne, or in a volcano's case, magma, with it!</p>
<p>Now, when you do it with a bottle, you may notice that the overflowing foam took a LOT, like 1/3rd or half the contents of the bottle with it. This will look similar for the magma chamber, which is now still filled with magma but at <em>much</em> lower remaining pressure...and that pressure can't hold up the roof of the magma chamber (with all the rock and volcanic mountain on top of it) anymore, causing it to cave in. This is exactly how your typical <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caldera" target="_blank">caldera</a> is formed, and a caldera collapse is an extremely violent and destructive event where effectively the rest of the magma is 'forced out', creating more ash and other tephra, pyroclastic flows, quakes, tsunamis if close to a body of water and reshaping the volcano's surface and sub-surface features in general and cataclysmic fashion!</p>
<p>Taal specifically already had caldera forming events before - the largest of which created the big 20km-wide hole Taal Lake is formed in! The lake poses additional danger: water aids in creating stream explosions when it comes into contact with magma in large enough volumes in confined spaces (underground), through fissures and cracks. This in particular can cause the volcano to 'blow off the cork' and start the rapidly depressurizing chain of events either directly or indirectly!</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>TL:DR</strong> Exponentially increasing depressurization can end in the whole volcano collapsing in on itself. That would be bad news to everyone in ~15-25km radius*!</p>
<p>*Edit: I should probably add that the ash and tephra pose a threat to people beyond that kind of radius, but the affected area is largely depending on winds and the actual size of the caldera event. Big VEI events can affect the global climate even, and those tend to be caldera events (1883 Krakatau, 1815 Tambora and 1257 Samalas are examples of large VEI Indonesian eruptions (VEI 6-7) that were felt even on the other side of the globe in Europe).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't think about a volcano like it's a balloon that you've poked a little hole in and it's gradually lowering in pressure.  It's more like the cap on a water pipe connected to some serious pressure way down the line and the pressure inside the hose is now enough that it's boring its own way out.  That means there's enough pressure to just blow the cap off entirely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One issue could be that the volcano is located on a small island in a lake. If the magma bubble empties and depressurizes, the volcano might collapse, water from the lake would rush in, contact the remaining magma, and <em>boom</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
