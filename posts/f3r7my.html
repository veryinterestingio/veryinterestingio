		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello, I'm Stanislas Dehaene, the author of the new book <strong>How We Learn: Why Brains Learn Better Than Any Machine... for Now</strong>. I'm the director of the NeuroSpin brain imaging center in Saclay, France, and the professor of experimental cognitive psychology at the College de France. I am very passionate about the human brain and its remarkable feats - my previous books were about how the brain does maths, how it learns to read, and what are the neuronal mechanisms of consciousness. But today, I focus more on &quot;how we learn&quot; - one of the major talents of the human brain. </p>
<p>I will be available 6-8 pm French time (12 EST, 17 UT), ask me anything!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! I was wondering what you think about what the construct of consciousness is? Is it perception of conscious thought and subconscious thought of knowledge and experience, or something else? And when would one describe an A.I. as a conscious being? Usually the Turing test is the most popular option, although it has the GÃ¶delian argument and Chinese Room argument is used against it's validity. How would you prove a strong A.I. as conscious to the degree of sapient? Is some level meta-cognitive thought inherently required to learn? And if so is there multiple levels to it through: consciousness, sentience, and sapience?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
