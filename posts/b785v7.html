How does this not happen with owls. Surely leaves rubbing together make the same amount noise as mice running, so there must be a lot of interference. How do they separate the different kinds of noise?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different frequencies, mostly.</p>
<p>Ears are physically tuned to certain frequencies.  In an owl, it's the higher frequencies -- the frequencies little mice make.  They literally hear them &quot;louder&quot; than other frequency sounds.</p>
<p>The brain also has a way of mentally tuning in/out sounds.  (Ever heard your name called in a crowded room despite hundreds of other voices?)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Picking out a specific noise among others is a lot more doable than it may seem. Like how humans can fairly easily hear an object fall even while talking, or a conversation over the engine of a car. The problem is mostly in picking up a specific sound among similar sounds (like one guy talking in a crowd). Or picking up noises when something else is ridiculously loud (which rarely happens in nature)</p>
<p>Owls have even better hearing than us and their disk shaped heads amplify sounds coming from the direction they face and makes picking up noise from a specific target even easier. Owls in normal conditions only have to separate the irregular, quick scurrying of rodents from natural nocturnal sounds like wind, crickets, and other bird sounds. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other people have said this, but it's a certain frequency that they tune into. It's like when you hear a notification message going off on your phone, it's something you recognize. For owls it comes with practice, trial, error, and judgement. Once they recognize a similar sound they will look for it to try and determine if it is what they think it is.</p>
<p>On a side note, other sounds do effect them. There is actually an epidemic when it comes to destroying ears. This becomes especially prevalent when looking at ocean life and how shipping frigates destroy their hearing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, there is not a lot of noise in the forest at night, so it's easy to detect a sound that has a pattern to it like a mouse moving.  Also, the owls usually take out their earbuds when hunting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have explained, but I just wanted to add a little extra information. Other sounds can and do affect an owls ability to hunt. A good example of this is rain, the sound of rain disguises the sound of prey. If you monitor owls, you'll notice that after a few days of rain, they'll be hunting in the day time which is a sign that they're starving. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
