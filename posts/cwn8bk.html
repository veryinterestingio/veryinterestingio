		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interesting question!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6609073/" target="_blank">This year the BMJ reviewed research into this</a> and generally found that not enough research has been done. They thought lying on your side while sleeping seemed to be generally protective against spinal symptoms (pain and stiffness). Take this with a pinch of salt though, as they only found four studies (Abanobi, 2015; Cary, 2016; Desouzart, 2016; Gordon, 2007) that had looked at sleeping posture and spine health.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6348954/" target="_blank">some slightly different studies</a> into the relationships between sleep posture, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25008402" target="_blank">quality of sleep, and pillow/mattress design</a>.</p>
<p>Overall though, this seems to be an under-researched area.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh boy, this is my time to shine. TLDR; your mattress ideally should match your spine curvature in neutral position.</p>
<p>your spine disc is hydrophilic. when you sleep, there's no gravitational pressure, hence it absorbs water from surrounding areas. when you wake up after 7-8 hours sleep, it gets swollen. hence you are taller in the morning.</p>
<p>As you wake up, the compression effect og gravity acting on your body will slowly force the water out of the discs, hence after about 2 hours, your spine disc will dehydrate most of the water and you shrunk to your average height.</p>
<p>The thing is, when your discs are swollen, your vertebral body are also more prone to traveculae fracture upon compression by about 20%. anterior and posterior ligaments are also more taunt due to disc increase in height, exerting pressure on the vertebral body itself. Hence your back being stiffer in the morning.</p>
<p>the trabeculae bone in your vertebral body is more resistant to compression fracture when the spine is in neutral posture compared to when its flexed by about 50%.</p>
<p>So if you sleep in neutral spine posture, and when you just wake up, you avoid excessive spine movement, then you lower your risk of spine injury. The thing is, some people naturally have more lordotic curve and some pople have more pronounce difference in waist to hip ratio. For these people sleeping on a hard matress will put their spine out or neutral posture, by the time you wake up, your spine disc annulus have migrated away from disc centre and the vertebral bodies are experiencing pressure unevenly. Excessively soft mattress also cause on-neutral spine posture. If your spine is still relatively &quot;virgin&quot;, sleeping in non-neutral pose is ok, but if your spine already experience some damage (that may or may not show in x-ray), then you will wake up with pain.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's look at this from the perspective of the muscular system. First we'll talk about a person who lays on their back through the majority of their sleep cycle and compare two variations of laying in this position.</p>
<p>The first variation has the person laying on their back and the person using a large/fluffy pillow. These pillows tend to put the persons head and neck into a flexed position. In other words this is the position you would see someone in if they were looking down at their phone. A few of the major muscles involved in flexion of the head and neck are the Sternocleidomastoid and the Scalenes group of muscles. Over time these muscles will adjust to this position and maintain shorten state. This is called a forward head posture. However these are not the only muscles effected by this position. The muscles on the back of the neck will also be effected. These would include the Trapezius, Sub Occipitals, Splenious Capitus, Splenious Cervicus, Erector Spinae Group and the Levator Scapula just to name a few. These muscles oppose flexion, meaning one of their jobs is extension of the head and neck. For example if you are standing and look up at the sky you are using these muscles for extension.</p>
<p>So if we go back to sleeping on our back with a large pillow under our head the muscles that want to perform extension will become tired from trying to return to a neutral position where as the muscles responsible for flexion will become shortened, as stated above. What we've been talking about up to this point is just one aspect of a condition called <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/upper-crossed-syndrome" target="_blank">Upper Crossed Syndrome</a>.</p>
<p>How does all of this relate to spinal health? Although Upper Crossed Syndrome is an issue of it's own it can also provide the opportunity for other issues, specifically relating to disc health. If you enter a state of prolonged flexion, looking down, this can lead to bulging discs. Basically as you look down the vertebrea will naturally compress in the front of the neck. If this is maintained for a long period of time the disc can be &quot;pushed&quot; toward the back of the neck. This position can also lead to nerve impingement.</p>
<p>Now if we consider the same position, laying on your back, without a pillow you will find yourself in a neutral position where the muscles in your neck are able to rest. Essentially this neutral position will not provide the opportunity for the above conditions to develop.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, this example alone is likely only going to be part of the equation. It is more likely that a healthy or unhealthy spine will be effected by daily activities as well as sleep posture. So if I'm lying in the healthiest position I can but I'm constantly looking down at my laptop or phone I'm more than likely going to bring that posture into bed with me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
