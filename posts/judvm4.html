They didn't really know what they were, but they knew these dots on the sky moved in an irregular pattern (e.x. Mars looked like it went backwards at times as our orbit overtook Mars).
The stars, by contrast, moved in more of a regular pattern.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because of the fact that since they also rotate around our sun, they move relative to the stars in an epicyclical motion. So while all the stars of the Big Dipper for instance or other constellations all remain fixed relative to each other, even though they “move” through the night sky as we rotate, the planets appeared unfixed and moved around. While I’m not sure humans before the telescope had an exact idea of what planets were, the word planet itself comes the Greek word πλανήτης meaning wanderer as they “wandered” throughout the sky unlike the other stars and so at least knew there was some differentiation between those lights in the sky and other fixed stars.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People didn't know planets were planets as we know them until Galileo used a new high tech toy (the telescope) to look at Jupiter and discovered that it had moons like the Earth's moon. </p>
<p>Planets visible to the naked eye were identified by their peculiar motions through the sky.  Mercury and Venus for example are always seen near the sun at sunrise or sunset, but they move from one side of the sun to the other on regular, relatively short intervals. You can see this effect with your own eyes by noting Mercury's location each day for about 4 months. </p>
<p>The visible planets aside from Saturn are also very bright at times compared to the average star. Venus at 135 degrees to the earth relative to the sun for example is the brightest natural object in the night sky aside from the moon, much brighter than the brightest night stars, and can even be seen in full daylight if you know where to look. This occurs about twice a year. The reason for the angle is that even though it's not as close as it can be, it reflects more sunlight. Reflected sunlight by the way is the entire reason for our nearby planets' apparent brightnesses. </p>
<p>Planets also don't twinkle like stars. This is because even though stars are very large, they are so far away that they look like points of light even through powerful telescopes. Points of light are slightly scattered by our atmosphere and your eye sees this effect as twinkling, the source of the light seeming to constantly change position slightly. Planets on the other hand can be resolved into disks (rather than mere points) under a very modest magnification. Though the naked eye can't detect the disc shape of planets, the discs as seen from Earth are large enough to encompass the area over which twinkling would be detected, effectively drowning it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stars don't really move in relation to each other quickly enough to o be observed. Planets probably were distinguished by early observers because they moved much more irradically and quickly relative to the stars.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
