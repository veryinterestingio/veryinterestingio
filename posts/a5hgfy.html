		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The time of Russian territorial expansion was a time of colonialism for all the great powers of Europe. Russia was not well situated to become a maritime power like most of Western Europe, but it did have essentially exclusive access to &quot;unclaimed&quot; territory to its east. While Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands were creating empires for themselves in the Americas and to a lesser extent in Africa and Asia, Russia spread east to Siberia. They were seeking what everyone was seeking, new lands to colonize and cultivate, new resources to tap, new people to spread the gospel of their religion to. </p>
<p>And it was &quot;available&quot;, so to speak. There were not, at the time, any great empires or powerful states laying claim to the territory. Only relatively undeveloped societies, mainly herders and hunter-gatherers, who could be easily conquered and subjugated. Just as Spain and France had laid massive territorial claims in North and South America, so did Russia to the vast northern expanse of Asia. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a bunch of reasons, but like most things human, there wasn't one cohesive decision point or really even a single decision made.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You've pointed to the late 1500's - that's the end of the Rurikid Dynasty (the most recognizable member being Ivan the Terrible).  At the start of the 1500's, the Russian state as you likely think of it didn't really exist.  It was a bunch of loosely confederated city-states with Moscow simply being one of several - and decidedly less powerful than Novgorod, Kiev and Tver at various times.  And until 1480, they were still paying tribute to the Tatar Golden Horde.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But we're basically talking about the expansions of Ivan IV (The Terrible) since he ruled the Grand Duchy of Moscow from 1533 and was crowned Tsar of All the Russias in 1547.  He died in 1584, so we're talking over 50 years.  The thing to remember is that he pushed the borders west and south as well as east.  He annexed Kazan and was the first Russian ruler to go to war against the Ottomans.  He became such a powerful military force that several Siberian states pledged fealty to him and became vassal states in the hope that Ivan and the Russian army would help them against their enemies.  Once the boyars (nobility) figured out that not only was Siberia sparsely populated but also rich in things like timber, furs and trade goods, they sent private armies (with permission from the throne) to grab what they could.  It took another 100 years, moving in fits and starts, for the conquest to the Pacific to be concluded, and Peter the Great's half-sister, who was ruling as regent for him and his half-brother, concluded a treaty that drew the border with China at the Amur River, where is been (more or less) since then.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Additionally, it's dangerous to think of Siberia as a monolithic frozen wasteland - some of it is, especially as you approach the Arctic Circle, but the Russians were working much farther south as well, in some very temperate climates.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Finally, the Muscovite Rus and the following political entities (including the Soviets and modern Russia) have worked from a &quot;next hill&quot; defensive strategy - basically they see the next hill as a threat to their safety and need to take it in order to achieve security.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Expansion into Siberia was originally undertaken by Cossack volunteers. The truth is difficult to discern, but the beginning of the long process of Siberian conquest is believed to have started with Yermak, a Cossack ataman. Cossacks are a unique people, and the only apt comparison I've seen was with the cowboys of the Wild West. They were a fiercely independent people, their livelihood centered around horses, which they also used in wars. Throughout Russia's history, they have been at the frontlines of every war. </p>
<p>In 1580s, after the end of Russia's war with Rzeczpospolita (at the time, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Yermak and his Cossacks were hired by some merchants to guard towns against the Sibir khan's raiding parties. Apparently Yermak thought that the best way to deal with the problem was to eliminate the Sibir khanate, and set out with considerable forces, though much smaller than those of the khan. Cossacsk, however, had superior weaponry. Eventually, Yermak took the Sibir town (also known as Qashliq), after which he sent a messenger to the Tsar. Ivan was quite happy with the news, and sent some reinforcements to Yermak. </p>
<p>Yermak's story reached a sad end, as he and most of his troops could not survive the Siberian winter (temperatures reached -47C that year). But the Sibir khanate was severely weakened, and when the winter was over, the Tsar's men settled in, founding the city of Tyumen. Russia's hold of the region was made certain, and by the end of the century the last of the Sibir khanate was conquered. Then it just kept going. There were unclaimed territories to the east, and though Russia was already big, men seeking adventure and a share of the land or riches joined the Cossacks that kept going east. The Cossacks mainly traversed the expanse by rivers, rarely venturing by land, unless they could quickly cross to a different river and keep going. As such, the size of Siberia hadn't been too much of an issue, as rivers are a much faster way to travel. Cossacks usually started with diplomacy, offering the locals to swear loyalty to the White Tsar and pay yasak (tax), but it was usually an &quot;or else&quot; situation. Often it came to arms, and gun-slinging Cossacks always won. The locals were subjugated, but as Russia was becoming an empire, they were becoming its subjects, which meant roughly equal rights to those of native Russian territories. </p>
<p>So, the reason for expansion beyond the Urals and the Sibir khanate wasn't wholly the state's command. But as the lands were rich (and though colder than most, they weren't and aren't a wasteland. It's continental climate, meaning cold winters and fairly warm summers), there was no point in stopping. Where the resistance was too great, Russia stopped. It had clashed with China, but didn't keep going when it proved to be too troublesome. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Russia has always been vulnerable to potential Western adversaries due to its geography. Its heartland is located on the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Europe_topography_map_en.png" target="_blank">North European Plain</a>, completely indefensible due to the absence of natural barriers. Thus, having a backup plan in case of it being overrun is a great idea. Siberia is protected by the Urals from the West. For instance, during WW2 a lot of the industry and parts of the population <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evacuation_in_the_Soviet_Union#Evacuation_of_industry" target="_blank">were evacuated</a> beyond the mountains to support the war effort from a safe distance. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
