		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's no reason why it's on the pole, no more than why there is no continent at the north pole.</p>
<p>It's a coincidence. Pangea, the most recent supercontinent, broke up into Gondwanaland (not to be confused with Gondwana, a supercontinent before Pangaea) and Laurasia. </p>
<p>Gondwanaland consisted of South America, Africa, India, Australia and Antarctica. Broadly, it was divided into a continent containing South America and Africa, and a continent containing India, Australia and Antarctica. India had broke off already by around 150 million years ago and was first to leave. The rifting between the two sections created the South Atlantic, but also pushed Antarctica and Australia southward. </p>
<p>By the early Cretaceous, Antarctica was over the south pole, and by the Miocene, Australia had rifted away and went to its present position, where it is still drifting north, pushing up the Indonesian islands.</p>
<p>There isn't anything particular about the location of any of the continents related to Earth's spin. If Earth span really, really fast, such as once every half hour, (we'd all be dead, but let's carry on) then the continents would tend to be displaced toward the poles, as they're not as dense as the oceanic crust, so would be displaced by it as the shape of the planet becomes much, much more flattened.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one has addressed this yet, but Antarctica perfectly fits the pole only because it's at the pole. The land itself is not all connected and it's the ice cap that makes it all one solid piece that's centered on the pole. It's an off center cluster of islands under the ice. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of its &quot;landmass&quot; is ice, the ice is being shaped by the temperature differences in the area. If the continent drifts the ice leaving the area melts and more ice forms on the opposite side.  It will seem to stay for the most part still until it drifts enough to expose dry land.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Antarctica was a part of Pangea and when it broke apart it is simultaneously “drifting” away from the other continents. It’s not really continental drift, it’s lithospheric plates and they’re all diverging from Antarctica. Spin of the Earth has nothing to do with it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
