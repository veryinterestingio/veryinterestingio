		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I knew that set point theory would be among the responses here, but that has been debunked. Your body does not have a weight set point that it tries to maintain.</p>
<p>The reality is simply that gaining weight is relatively easy and losing it is hard. If you've been big, and lost weight, then you still have all the habits associated with being big. It's easy to continue with/fall back on these habits and become big again, whereas staying thin requires fighting against the behaviours you know. Sustainable behaviour change is actually incredibly hard for most people.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the second time around you must be older, by virtue of time passing, so your metabolism is likely to be slower - metabolic decline is approximately linear after age 25, after all. So not only are you fighting against behaviours you may not have successfully changed, but your metabolism is also slower, even if incrementally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People get fat from consuming more calories than they exert (over eating) consistently. It becomes a learned behavior/habit; typically one they enjoy. When losing weight, they need to break that habit which is simple but difficult (just eat less). Often times, people think that once they hit their goal weight, they can return to eating like they used to (mostly because they want to). But eating that way got them fat in the first place. They most likely gained the weight first over a long period of time, went through a short phase of eating less, then resumed over eating which puts the weight back on (which seems quicker because they initially gained the weight over a longer period of time and just stayed at however overweight/obese they were according to their TDEE - total daily energy expenditure).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><del>Nutrition is complicated, but one big contributing factor is the presence of fat cells. The fat has to be stored somewhere, so your body builds cells whose job it is to just have a ton of fat in them. That's it, just little fat warehouses. When you exercise to lose weight, you burn the fat from the cells, but you don't lose the cells. They hang out, ready to do their job again.</del></p>
<p><del>After all, life evolved in hardship. Most things don't know when they're going to get to eat again. And you just made your body go through a grueling regimen or diet. It doesn't know if that will happen again, or if you'll have food before then. You had enough food to store a bunch of extra calories once, you should probably be prepared to do it again.</del></p>
<p><del>So when you start gaining weight again, you don't have to waste time and energy building new fat cells.</del></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Every &quot;explanation&quot; I've read for this dubious phenomenon has been pretty thoroughly debunked, or at least the evidence was inconclusive. I've also noticed in myself (I lost a bunch of weight and have now controlled my weight specifically over years through bulking and cutting cycles) that my weight responds in an absolutely mechanical way to number of calories. When I eat more, it immediately start going up, and when I eat less, it immediately start going down. No matter how many times I bulk or cut, the amount of calories required to make it move remains the same.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>That anecdote is hardly proof, but I'd want to see some significant, convincing studies that proved this effect before I accepted it as more than a justification for why people can't keep weight off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
