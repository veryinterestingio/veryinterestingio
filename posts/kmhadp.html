		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While there are many great technical answers on this thread, a simpler answer may be a process known as &quot;survivorship bias&quot;. It seems so much harder to memorize things on purpose because you're much more likely to notice when you forget (like on a test). Random memories that seem to appear out of nowhere usually have no reason to be challenged. In truth, almost all of the fine details of most people's lives are forgotten fairly quickly. Our memories often fill in the gaps when it's not so important to remember every detail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The brains memory &quot;creator&quot; the hippocampus is literally attached to the emotional center of the brain, the amygdala. The amygdala &quot;tags&quot; the memory in the hippocampus with certain emotions and sensations, so when the memory is stored in the brain it has that tag. When you smell, hear, etc. a sound similar to the tag that the amygdala gave its causes the memory to pop up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Real answer: those &quot;memories&quot; you're recalling &quot;perfectly&quot; of seemingly random events aren't really memories. They're more like forensic reconstructions based on related data.</p>
<p>As an example, let's say you went to Disneyland with your family when you were 8 and had a great time.</p>
<p>When you recall having a great time at Disneyland(your emotional response) your brain starts pulling information that was <em>probably true</em> to build a memory of your day at Disneyland. You loved a specific Mickey Mouse shirt when you were a kid so you brain says &quot;hey, we love that shirt and it's on theme so we were probably wearing that shirt.&quot; Next, you loved funnel cake as a kid so your brain says &quot;Funnel cake would have made that day good so we probably had funnel cake.&quot; And your brain continues this reconstruction until you have your &quot;perfect memory.&quot; In reality you actually wore a plain black t-shirt because you left the Mickey one at home by accident and Disneyland didn't even sell funnel cake when you were 8.</p>
<p>&quot;But I recalled it perfectly! It can't be a reconstruction, I wouldn't be this sure of the sequence of events!&quot;</p>
<p>Confidence in the accuracy of ones own recall has effectively 0 correlation with the accuracy of that recall. It's why &quot;eye witness testimony&quot; it so fucking terrible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Evolution made our brains to function as a survival tool. Therefore we tend to remember things that are attached to our emotions. This allowed early humans to remember the dangers of their environment, remember which plants are poisonous and which ones are healthy etc.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your memory is actually really terrible. And studies show that every time you recall a memory it actually gets “rewritten.” There are tricks to help you memorize that have been employed and used for centuries such as putting an a list of items or numbers in places you’re familiar. For example if you have a grocery list you can mentally walk through your home and a put a carton of milk on your table, put a stick of butter on the couch, bread on the TV, and so on...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
