		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don’t know what the timer on immunity, from natural infection or from vaccines, actually is yet; it may be quite long (several years), since early testing several months after vaccination only showed a very slow drop off. </p>
<p>Re-exposure to antigen acts as a booster. That’s true whether the antigen comes in the same form a the original or in different forms. So in theory, infection following vaccination should act like another booster, and increase immunity, potentially to even higher than the previous peak. </p>
<p>(One of the vaccine trials commented in passing that they’d seen this happen, that vaccination followed by infection did lead to higher antibody titers. I don’t remember which trial, and I don’t think the data were actually shown.)</p>
<p>But this isn’t guaranteed to happen - don’t go exposing yourself to virus after you’re vaccinated, looking for a cheap booster. </p>
<p>If the exposure to virus happens when there’s a very strong immune response, then quite possibly the virus will never get a chance to infect cells, and there won’t be enough virus to drive a booster infection. (There’s some evidence that vaccines completely block infection for quite a while - the preliminary evidence that says the vaccines likely block most asymptomatic infections and most transmission fits with this.)</p>
<p>If the exposure happens when the immune response has faded away too much (or if the virus you’re exposed to is a vaccine-resistant variant), you have a chance of getting sick, and a very good chance of being able to transmit the virus to your family and friends, before the booster kicks in. </p>
<p>And there’s a limit to how much boosting you can get, for various reasons. </p>
<p>So yes, if you’re exposed in the right window, the exposure can act as a booster. But you’re probably starting with years of protection, so the gain is small, and the risk is not trivial.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Immunity&quot; is sort of a nebulous concept when you actually get down to it, because the immune system is so complicated and we could be talking about a huge range of outcomes. Complete immunity to getting infected? Immunity from dying from the virus? Immunity from feeling symptoms? Immunity from spreading it? Those are each different outcomes that might be different in different people.   There are two major kinds of adaptive immunity, antibody responses and T-cell mediated.  When you get a vaccine or a viral infection, you make all kinds of antibodies against anything on the surface of the virus. When you get exposed repeatedly, the antibodies get boosted and the top binding ones can achieve very high titers in the blood.  Every time you get infected, you'll typically see a bump in levels that then gradually fades, and the time to fade varies a LOT.  Smallpox and measles vaccination might be for life, others aren't as durable.  </p>
<p>The thing is, even if you don't have crazy high titers against the virus, you might get infected but the immune system has a faint &quot;memory&quot; of the previous infection.  Even if it's a different strain of virus, you might have some antibodies that already kind of bind it a bit. You probably also have T-cell immunity against other viral components.  That means your immune system recognizes on day one that something bad is going down, it does things to summon help and slow down early viral replication, and you're not starting completely flat-footed.  The immune system takes time to ramp up, and that difference in time between how quickly the immune system ramps up and how quickly the virus does is part of what determines how sick you get.  A vaccine might only give your immune system a two day head start, but that's enough to make the difference between living and dying.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vaccines dont make you completely immune, they only make you highly resistant to the virus. Making it harder for you to get it. But even vaccinated, you can still catch it.</p>
<p>If you catch it however, the effects of the virus wont be as bad. This is because antibodies in bloodstream are actively and effectively fighting it every step of the way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
