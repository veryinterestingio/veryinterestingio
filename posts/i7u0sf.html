	<title>ELI5 Can patients in comas cough or sneeze? I've read patients in comas can still breath on their own, but wouldn't cough. Since coughing always seems to be a reflex and not a conscious decision, would a patient in a coma be able to sneeze or cough? If not, then why not?</title>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You’ve got a lot of non medical answers. </p>
<p>Consciousness is a scale or spectrum, think like 0 - 10, rather than binary of “either conscious or unconcious.”</p>
<p>Some people who are of slightly altered consciousness can still breathe but won’t wake up or respond. Many can still cough, and in fact this is sometimes considered “protecting the airway.” Often the use of suction to clear out phlegm from the airway in patients with breathing tubes triggers coughing. </p>
<p>Some patients who are very unconscious will neither breathe nor cough. </p>
<p>I’ve never seen a patient with a breathing tube or altered consciousness sneeze so I don’t think that happens but I could be wrong on that front.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best answer is it depends on the coma.</p>
<p>Different scales exist for assessing level of consciousness. Probably the most widely used is the Glasgow Coma Scale, which is scored in time of eyes, vocal, and motor responses to stimuli. These are scored out of 4, 5 and 6 respectively. So, a corpse is GCS 3 (no response to any stimuli.) A normally functioning person is GCS15.</p>
<p>However, in a &quot;deep&quot; enough coma, a live, breathing person may also go as low as 3. They're very unlikely to still have the required reflexes for coughing or sneezing in this state though.</p>
<p>In this scale, generally someone scoring about 8 or under is &quot;unconscious&quot;, to some degree. It's not a binary thing. People may be unconscious by this definition while still able to cough or sneeze. Under GCS8 they're less likely to be able to protect their own airway with these reflexes.</p>
<p>I'm not aware of a hard line for where &quot;coma&quot; begins, but for most purposes, we could call it a persistent state of significantly reduced GCS, especially one without an easily reversed cause (e.g. drugs which the body will metabolize and eliminate without any assistance.)</p>
<p>Edit: to give a wee example, a person could drink until they pass out and maybe reach GCS3. However, all else being equal and with a normally functioning liver, there's a pretty good chance they'll return to consciousness in a fairly brief timeframe, providing they don't have any mishaps like choking on vomit. We're talking a matter of hours. For that reason they wouldn't generally be considered to be &quot;in a coma&quot;, despite their state (even with the possible loss of reflexes.) GCS doesn't offer hard lines for what &quot;coma&quot; means, and indeed there's not really a single solid definition for the word in common use. That's why your question is confusing folk :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cough reflex is lost. In coma as well as unconsciousness. Therefore you might have seen unconsciousness patients brought up in emergency who aspirate their own puke because their cough reflex isn't working. Reminds of Jane's death in breaking bad, she choked on her own vomitus because sleep is also like an unconscious state. Only difference is that that a sleeping person can be roused if stimulated enough but a comatose person won't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Might no be the common rule but my mom used to be in coma during 5-7 days after a stroke + brain haemorrhage (she's well know, thank god).</p>
<p>During this period she was in a sort-of &quot;grade 1&quot; coma as doctors said : she basically was &quot;asleep&quot; 70-80% of the time but regained some consciousness the last days. She had breathing assistance and she was able to cough. </p>
<p>Doctors and nurses said it was a reflex because of the tube, that patients often do that because the body &quot;senses&quot; the Intrusion of a foreign object or something like that.</p>
<p>As I said I don't know if it's the norm, plus English isn't my mother language so it's been quite difficult to translate my thoughts and some medical terms in proper English. Hope this helped you in any way ;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
