		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR --  A lot of disease causing organisms don't compete with eachother at all; some do through either indirect methods (ex. malaria causes fevers that kill syphilis) or direct methods (ex. GI bacteria compete with eachother).</p>
<p>So I'll tell you about an example of &quot;Diseases that you can get at the same time&quot; and some of &quot;Pathogens killing other Pathogens.&quot;</p>
<p>As an example of times different pathogens don't interfere we'll look at respiratory diseases, in this case let's talk about a viral respiratory infection and a bacterial pneumonia.  So Mrs. Smith gets the Flu (or a Cold, or another viral respiratory disease); the virus shoots some genetic material into cells which tricks them into producing more viruses (which infect more cells, etc. etc.).  This leads to an immune response, Mrs. Smith feels sick, her immune system is busy, her body is stressed and expending resources fighting the virus.  Mrs. Smith always has some &quot;strept Pneumoniae&quot; bacteria around (living in the mouth/upper respiratory tract), but now that she's sick it can grow out of control because her immune system isn't as effective at mopping it up, and her respiratory lining is less effective at pushing stuff up out of the lungs due to her viral illness; the strept bacteria grow like crazy, Mrs. Smith now has a Bacterial Pneumonia in addition to her Viral Illness.  (The Virus is replicating by making cells make more virus the Bacteria reproduces on its own growing in the lungs -- the two aren't competing for resources).</p>
<p>To look at pathogens that interfere with eachother let's talk about treating Syphilis in the 1920s.  This is before Penicillin was discovered and well before it was regularly treated.  Syphilis is a progressive disease - it eventually will debilitate people and eventually kill them and the body doesn't fight it well.  So people came up with this clever strategy called &quot;Pyrotherapy&quot; (inducing high fevers to fight infection) -- turns out a really high fever will kill Syphilis.  The disease Malaria is known to cause really high fevers, and we had a means of treating it (quinine- a plant derivative).  So to treat late-stage Syphilis it was actually quite effective to infect a patient with Malaria, let them run crazy high fevers (this was dangerous, the fevers were high enough to cause harm), and then treat the patient with Quinine to cure the Malaria after the fact.   (So in this case, the Malaria causing protozoan wasn't *killing* the syphilis causing bacteria, but it did interfere by causing fevers).  ((Obviously this treatment wasn't great, people died, but it was better than just definitely dying of syphilis until we discovered penicillin ^((if you want to read more about horrible medical experimentation and syphilis look up the Tuskegee study it's a horrifying breach of ethics that lasted well into the 20th century)))</p>
<p>But wait, there's more!  Let's talk about &quot;Normal GI Flora.&quot;  Remember we are constantly covered in bacteria inside and out (mostly this doesn't harm you, in fact a lot of it is helpful, bacteria help with digestion, bacteria are responsible for why sweaty armpits smell the way they do, bacteria even kill other bacteria sometimes).  So normally bacteria are constantly trying to grow, and they compete with other bacteria for food (they're eating scraps him the human GI tract, every species of bacteria is fighting over the same scrap pile); no only do they compete by 'eating the same food' they also engage in chemical warfare with eachother (bacteria often release chemicals toxic to other species of bacteria to attempt to kill competitors [this is actually where we discovered a number of antibiotics]).  Let's go back to Mrs. Smith from my respiratory example -- she takes some antibiotics for her respiratory problem, she leaves the hospital, she's feeling better for now; the unfortunate side effect of the antibiotics she's taking is they kill *lots of bacteria* not just the ones making her sick.  If we kill a lot of the normal bacteria in her GI tract, it wipes out a lot of competition and lets the species that happen to resist the antibiotic she was taking grow unchecked. A common perpetrator of such overgrowth in this case is the bacteria C. Difficile -- it's known for causing serious (sometimes life threatening) GI infections, and while it's not uncommon for c.diff to be present in the GI tract, it can grow unchecked when other bacteria are killed off.  (In this case, pretty much any bacteria in the GI tract have the *potential* to cause disease (ex. some strains of e.coli are normal in the GI tract but would cause disease if in a wound) but the fact that they compete with eachother helps prevent a pathologic condition.</p>
<p>I am almost certain I had one more example but I lost it while writing those ones up. I'll drop it in an edit if I think of it.</p>
<p>TL;DR --  A lot of disease causing organisms don't compete with eachother at all.  Some do through either indirect methods (ex. malaria causes fevers that kill syphilis) or direct methods (GI bacteria compete with eachother).</p>
<p>(Edit: I copied the TL;DR to the top because apparently I started national novel writing month early right here in this post.  Also I fixed some spelling)  </p>
<p>(Edit 2:  Thanks everyone for the Awards/Upvotes/Questions -- glad to answer what I can; I'm not an infectious disease expert by any means so just sharing some facts I've picked up along the way (I'm an Anesthesia guy - we pick up a lot of facts along the way))</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To the bacteria and viruses that make our bodies their permanent home, we're like a vast ecosystem that they are part of.  The first threat that potential pathogens encounter isn't our immune system, but that community of hungry and/or competitive microfauna.  A would be disease organism has much more to fear from that than from another disease organism except in cases already noted in other comments.</p>
<p>When it comes to viruses, they can also wind up sharing their genetic code and creating new strains or even whole new viruses.  If different viruses infect a cell, when the cell starts making parts for each virus, they can wind up being packaged in novel ways.  Think of mashing together different LEGO sets.  HIV is just such a virus, a combination of three viruses from three different species that were brought together because chimpanzees love to eat smaller primates.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
