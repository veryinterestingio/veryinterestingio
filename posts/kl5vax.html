		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we talk about developing immunity we’re talking about developing memory t and b cells. During an immune reaction, some sentinel immune cells recognize danger and activate your t and B cells. After the virus gets cleared by a successful immune reaction, most of your t and B cells die off but a few of them hunker down and remember the disease. Then the next time they see the disease, they have a jump start and can quickly ignite a really good immune reaction way faster than last time and clear things before there’s enough virus to cause a problem. But the first time it takes t and B cells a week to get activated fully activated after exposure and then some more time to turn into good memory cells. If you only get exposed to a tiny amount of virus it will get dealt with by the other immune cells that are responsible for initial containment, and those cells won’t pass the info on to start your t and B cells to get fully activated because they aren’t needed. So for that reason, you don’t get the kind of immunity you’d get from getting the disease or a vaccine by just a tiny dose of virus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variolation" target="_blank">Variolation</a> is known to work with other diseases; you get a small dose in hopes of getting a small but manageable infection. The trick is that the exposure need to be big enough that it is noticed by the secondary immune response but small enough to not grow fast enough to create significant disease.</p>
<p>There's some observations that suggest that this might work with COVID-19, and it might happen to you accidentally, but it is unknown what, if any dose, could lead to safe and effective outcomes for a large enough percentage of the population.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Viral load is a bit of per terminology as it can mean different things based on context.</p>
<p>That said, it is important to remember that your body has a lot of layers of defenses, and the passive defenses prevent a lot of illness before your primary immune system will even see the disease. This is part of what wearing masks does: it adds yet another layer of passive defense to the mucus and other defenses your body already has.</p>
<p>To gain actual immunity, enough of the virus has to get in to active your adaptive immune system, and needs to have enough that non-specific antibodies aren't enough - there is <a href="https://www.hematology.org/newsroom/press-releases/2020/possible-link-between-blood-type-and-covid-19#:~:text=Among%20the%20COVID-19%20positive,than%20people%20with%20type%20O" target="_blank">evidence</a> that the O blood type provides some (but not great) protection against COVID, likely due to the effect of anti-A and anti-B antibodies.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that what you are proposing is how some vaccines function, namely live-attenuated (you get injected with a living but weakened virus; MMRV and Small Pox) and inactivated vaccines (the virus is killed; flu, polio, hepatitis a). The other primary form of vaccine is a subunit vaccine, which is used for hepatitis b and whooping cough, and consists of just a single protein or sugar, which is what the currently developed COVID vaccines use. Specifically, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mRNA.html" target="_blank">COVID vaccines</a> use part of the mRNA of the virus to cause our bodies to build a protein that our immune system then learns to attack.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes but viruses multiple so quickly that small dose of the virus could become a large dose once inside your body.</p>
<p>Also a small does might not create a large enough immune response, so your body doesn’t have enough antibodies the next time your exposed or enough memory cells in future when it has to produce antibodies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have been wondering this same thing myself and this morning was trying to figure out how to phrase this very question!  Thanks for asking the question.  </p>
<p>What prompted the question is people asking &quot;How long were you in the presence of the infected person?&quot; as an indicator of your chances of catching the virus yourself.  If it takes 15 minutes in the same room but you're only in the room for 10, you've still be exposed a little, right?  </p>
<p>Anyway I've seen the long responses to your question, so need need for anyone to answer it again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
