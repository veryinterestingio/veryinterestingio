		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>you have these weird balloons/shell type things in your nostrils called turbinates, and usually they are never equal in size, one is more open and the other closed. when you are sick they enlarge, the 'closed' one will enlarge to a point that it will block breathing but it's a good thing that they work in a balance, so if one is closed, then the other is indeed open. </p>
<p>you can play with this when you are sick by lying down on your side and observing your breathing, gravity will act on the fluid in these turbinates, and it'll pull all the liquid from whichever turbinate is highest to whichever is lowest. when you turn on your other side and wait a minute, you will notice your breathing will flip and the blocked nostril will open, and soon after the open nostril will tighten up until it closes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, this is to prevent either nostril from becoming overworked. It occurs at all times but is more noticeable when congested, as there are other things blocking your nose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nostrils go through a natural cycle. Some other people have shared some explanations of why this happens but it is a normal, healthy function for one nostril to be slightly more closed than the other one and for them to switch periodically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
