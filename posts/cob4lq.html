		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different plants are adapted for pollination by different means - grasses are wind pollinated, many crops are bee pollinated, some plants are pollinated by other insects or vertebrates. The degree of specificity varies, with some plants requiring a specific insect species and others being pollinated decently well by a range of insects. Honeybees are a big deal because they’re colonial and humans have figured out how to move big groups of them around in boxes to pollinate crops. If every honeybee died, other bees and insects would pick up some of the slack, but yields might not be as good. Humans can also hand-pollinate, but it’s really time consuming.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what others have said, bees also have a tendency to stick to one group of flowers at a time. For example, if they’re sipping nectar from say lantana, they’ll stick to that lantana bush. Whereas, a butterfly, for example is more random...”hmmm this lantana looks nice, oh wait look at that penta!” For pollination to be successful, the animal (insect, bird, bat...etc) must spread pollen from same flower to same flower. That’s how a flower is fertilized and is then able to come to seed/fruit. </p>
<p>Also, pollen sticks to the proboscis (straw-like tongue) of bees really well. Whereas, with butterflies (sorry, I’m a lepidopterist and butterflies are my speciality) the pollen may not always stick to their proboscis quite as well. Some species of butterflies are better pollinators than others, the Heliconia species, they carry pollen the best on their proboscis. Other butterflies can sometimesssss carry pollen on their great big wings, Tiger Swallowtails, for example. Tiger Swallowtails will brush their wings amongst pollen at times and carry that pollen dust on their wings to the next flower. But again, bees take the cake for actually retaining a greater amount of pollen on that proboscis. </p>
<p>This is why bees make for some of the best pollinators.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean Honey Bees specifically? Here in North America at least the honey bee is not native. When you hear &quot;save the bees&quot; everyone immediately thinks honey bees. And while they do have some issues with the varroa destructor mite and pesticide use (as most insects deal with these days) there are tons of other native pollinators besides the honey bee, which of course are also dealing with loss of habitat and pesticides. In fact (in NA) nearly all honey bees are domesticated in managed colonies. They don't fare well in the wild on their own. Some do, but not in any great number. </p>
<p>I realize this is not an exact answer to your question, but I wanted to expand upon and give some context to the phrase &quot;save the bees&quot; that I assume is the basis for this question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honeybees (apis mellifera) are essential for large scale agriculture. </p>
<p>While different pollinators are better at pollinating different flowers, only honeybees have a big enough foraging force to pollinate hundreds of acres of plants blooming at the same time. </p>
<p>Honeybees can be kept and moved in managed hives, and each colony has tens of thousands of workers who can forage in a 5km radius. Most other pollinator species live alone or in small nests (that are difficult to move/propagate) with a few dozen workers at most, foraging in a much smaller radius. </p>
<p>Given the scale of modern agriculture, honeybees are the only practical option for pollination.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Flies are comparable to bees and the rest of hymenoptera in pollination in a healthy ecosystem. We keep hearing about save the bees and everything, but I don't think that it's because they are necessarily the best pollinators (which also depends if you are talking about usefulness for humans or for the environment), but because talking about native bees, other pollinators and the complexity of ecology is a lot more difficult and people tend to avoid or forget complicated topics.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you want to read more I suggest the ipbes report on pollination called &quot;Assessment report of pollination, pollinators and food production&quot;. There are two documents, one is a very long read and the other is a summary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
