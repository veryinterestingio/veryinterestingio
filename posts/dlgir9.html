		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nobody is actually answering the question: which is how do they <strong>knock you out in 10 seconds</strong> not just “how do they knock you out” which is much less clear.</p>
<p>The answer as to why does it work so fast is that anesthetics are extremely fat soluble, which means they enter the brain extremely quickly. Anything which can enter the brain extremely quickly will have a fast onset and thus works very quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I guess I’m pretty qualified to answer this as an anesthesiologist. The length of time it takes for a drug to take action on the body depends on a few things. Since this is ELI 5 I’ll do my best to keep it simple. The two most common ways to receive a drug are by mouth (swallowing a pill or a liquid), or by having them injected into your vein (IV medications). If you take a drug by mouth, it will take longer to get into your blood stream than if you have a drug given through an IV. Giving medications through an IV will skip the stomach absorption, and will go directly through your veins, go to your heart, and then be pumped to your brain. If you have a very strong medication, like propofol, which is used to put patients to sleep, it will take 1 arm-brain circulation time to take effect, which is generally 10-15 seconds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1)- Fat soluble drugs, small molecular size (inhaled volatile anesthetics) easily pass through the blood brain barrier</p>
<p>2) IV administration. Immediate entry of the drug into the blood stream... takes second for it to circulate through the body then see point 1</p>
<p>3) Some drugs when given for conscious sedation ( small dose of fentanyl and midazolam) patients think they are knocked out, in reality there is a amensic effect and patients don't remember. In reality, they are awake, moving and often talking but remember absolutely nothing....&quot; They got me on the table and WHAM lights out&quot;. when actually patients may be slightly squirming around (notably with colonoscopies!) which then you receive extra dose of sedatives and that relaxes people more so in turn they don't move.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>What we know about general anesthetic is that it interrupts normal function of your central nervous system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the anaesthetic. There are a few kinds, and sometimes it's just a lucky accident that it does what it does. One low tech way of describing it is to say that the anaesthetic gets between your brain and the environment - like putting your hand over a socket so someone can't plug a device in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
