		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mining engineer here. The reason it is cheaper to mine directly from the Earth is because sorting Mineral X from a bunch of rock is a fairly straightforward process. Rock has a set of properties and Mineral X has completely different  set of properties. So you can use the differences to extract what you want. For example, magnets and density separation could remove iron from rock.</p>
<p>If you were to mine from a landfill, you would have to sort out countless different types of material. All these materials act differently, so you would have to individually process for each type of material. It is possible, but there would be so much contamination and the process would be very expensive.</p>
<p>In the future, landfills will be mines, but right now it's too expensive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difficulty with landfill is that you have no idea what's in it. There may be a host of heavy metals and organic chemical which pose an unknown hazard to anyone handling the material.<br />
There have been many cases where people have been caught tipping materials which have not been authorised in landfill, so there will be many more who never got caught.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s efficient to mine and know what you’re getting. In a titanium mine, you can go through the kroll process which is a well defined set of reactions to separate titanium.  </p>
<p>Plastics are a byproduct of oil and gas refineries. When you take gas from the grown, the hydrocarbons you get are useful in making plastics. </p>
<p>When you recycle from a landfill, you’re going to have to sort out a lot of things you don’t know what they are. Even worse, chemical separations may be more difficult because separating titanium from dirt may be easy, but separating titanium from dirt, plastic, other metals, may not be as easy. Second, it can take a lot of energy to separate the wanted items from the unwanted items. Recycling polyethylene is doable but recycling polystyrene is not cost effective. </p>
<p>Also, materials can be degraded in a landfill. Cardboard soaked with grease can’t be recycled into paper. Leaked gas could make things flammable where not expected. </p>
<p>One more reason, is that recycled plastics are of worse quality than new plastic. Recycled plastics go through wear and tear. If you bend a plastic like a mechanical pencil clip, it’ll turn white due to stresses on the material. That’s can’t easily be rearranged. Second is that melting a plastic can lead to undesirable cross links that make the polymer less valuable. A lot of purposes will require new plastics rather than recycled</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
