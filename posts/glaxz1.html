		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a solid, the different <del>atoms</del>EDIT:molecules are held together by the electric force (called intermolecular bonds). The knife edge comes by and pushes the molecules apart by wedging itself between them, exerting its own electric force on the molecules of the solid. If the forces between the molecules of the knife are stronger than what you're cutting, then it &quot;cuts&quot; by pushing the molecules far enough apart that they are no longer attract through the electric force.</p>
<p>That's at least true when you push a knife straight down on something. Knives also have little tiny teeth on them, even if very finely honed. Slicing or sawing something adds in a sideways force from the teeth poking in and then moving along the material breaking intermolecular bonds.</p>
<p>If this is confusing, you can imagine having 2 magnets stuck together, then jamming a wedge in where they meet. Push the wedge in and it forces the magnets apart until they are far enough that they can't jump back together on their own. It's the same thing as that except our imaginary example uses the magnetic force instead of the electric force.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Technically, we never &quot;touch&quot; anything at an atomic level. The atoms are simply repelling each other, e.g. if I pick up a coin and put it on the back of my hand it's technically floating. When you cut something with a knife, you're just repelling the item's atoms apart from each other. Kinda neat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine that a person represents an atom.</p>
<p>A large crowd of people represents a block of those atoms. And if all of those people are holding hands with each other this represents the bonds between the individual atoms - to make a solid block of the substance.</p>
<p>What happens when you part our crowd of people? Some of them have to stop holding hands with each other so that they can spread apart, but those people remain whole. This is what happens when you slice our solid block of the substance - the bonds between the atoms are broken, but the atoms themselves remain intact.</p>
<p>Splitting an atom would be like dissecting a person in our crowd...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
