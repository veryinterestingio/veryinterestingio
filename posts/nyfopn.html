		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Possibly. The flu vaccine in circulation in any year is targeted at the strains currently/likely to be an issue at the time, but they are all mutations of the same underlying virus.</p>
<p>There's also the factor that people now, in general, have better general health than people in 1918. Your basic ability to cope with mostly non lethal viruses is a lot higher than someone in 1918.</p>
<p>All that being said, you live in a world of health and food standards, where soap and hand washing all the time are normal, where clean clothes every day is a matter of course - so there's a reasonable likelihood you would fall ill to something else that the manner we live in today eradicates the infection vector of</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a neat article about failed vaccine development during the 1918 pandemic: <a href="https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/blog/vaccine-development-spanish-flu" target="_blank">https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/blog/vaccine-development-spanish-flu</a></p>
<p>The modern flu vaccine protects against variants of A/H1N1, which is what the Spanish flu was: &quot;Most flu vaccines in the United States protect against four different flu viruses (“quadrivalent”); an influenza A (H1N1) virus, an influenza A (H3N2) virus, and two influenza B viruses.&quot; From <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/keyfacts.htm#:~:text=Most%20flu%20vaccines%20in%20the,and%20two%20influenza%20B%20viruses" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/keyfacts.htm#:~:text=Most%20flu%20vaccines%20in%20the,and%20two%20influenza%20B%20viruses</a>.</p>
<p>The Spanish flu spread fast for 2 reasons: general lack of sanitation and lack of exposure to the specific strain type.  The modern vaccine would have helped by providing immunity to variants of the A/H1N1, so yes it would have helped.  It's hard to say how much though.  There would be far fewer mortalities because the sanitation aspect because the immune system wouldn't be starting from scratch, but it would still have spread fast because of sanitation.  And it killed infants/children, who are not typically immunized against the flu.  That's were we got lucky with covid.  It doesn't affect the young the way influenza does.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The vaccines we get today are based on modern flu viruses. We only vaccinate against a couple of strains per year and there are other strains we don't vaccinate against. You can see in previous years when we vaccinate against the wrong strains that there isn't a lot of protection offered by the vaccines.</p>
<p>So the answer is probably not but there is no research to actually say definitively yes or no. We would have to test he vaccine against those specific strains to actually know if it works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The real question isn't simply whether they would protect you but to which degree they would protect you. It's not unlikely that a modern vaccine would show some degree of efficacy against an old virus strain, but maybe you're talking about 5% protection instead of 95%. For instance, having been infected by flu viruses in general during the past couple of years offers some degree of protection against new strains. But not to the degree a targeted vaccine does.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
