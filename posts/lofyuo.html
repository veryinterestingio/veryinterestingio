A single person quits, no big deal - everyone quits and your business shuts down.</p>
<p>Unions give workers leverage that they don't have as individuals, and thus give them the power to demand things from their boss they would otherwise be unable to procure.  Naturally, bosses don't want this because it lessens the power they have in labor negotiations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unions can be a way for employees to gain bargaining power against their employer. </p>
<p>They represent a risk to employers, because if there is a strong union, the employer has less control over the conditions of employment.</p>
<p>That being said, most employers have a strong incentive to keep their employees from unionizing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was a Union Vice President and am generally pro-union. However, there are some problems with unions and structures that are the underlying argument against them.</p>
<p>Collective Bargaining - Essentially all the workers bargain for wages, working conditions, hours and all manner of things. This largely depends on the type of union and the type of business or government entity. For instance, Federal Government unions bargaining as one with Congress and not a local manager. They are also not able to strike as this is seen as a matter of national security. In this way Fed unions are very different than the striking unions often portrayed in movies.  The other unions types I break down as trades unions (electrical, longshoremen) and local gov unions (Teachers, police).</p>
<p>The manual of worker rights and Labor and Industry is about a half-inch thick for non-union workers and it's about 3 inches for union workers. There are MANY rules that govern union workers while there is almost none for non-union. This helps protect workers from poor management.</p>
<p>Unions also offer many benefits like insurance and lawyers. Local stewards (union volunteers) help workers know their rights and represent them if there is a conflict with management. All these things sound great, right? But there are still issues</p>
<p>Unions are another layer of management and are antagonistic to management. This isn't my opinion but a time honored condition of a good union. A union should not be &quot;in-bed&quot; with management. Many good workers often find themselves frustrated because they just want to work and management often tries union-busting tactics that hurt all workers.</p>
<p>Union dues can be quite expensive (trade unions mostly) and some have closed shops which means you are union or you don't have a job.</p>
<p>Fed unions can mostly bargain for more money (because it is a tangible thing) rather than better working conditions <em>which is what most workers want</em>. Good unions are built by bad bosses. Organizing and implementing a union can be downright deadly so unions typically start because of some really bad conditions and terrible bosses.</p>
<p>Despite unions claims of supporting workers this often is more in spirit than in reality. From what I've seen, if a boss wants you gone, you gone (especially if you are union). Also, the Executive Council/Board of the union doesn't always represent the line workers and often seem similar to management. While Union Exec's are elected, there are often problems and power plays with elections and corruption isn't unheard of.</p>
<p>The fact is management wants COMPLETE control to do whatever they want with THEIR business. Unions make it a joint venture between management and workers. We have become so use to the hierarchical nature of work and life that an entity like a union, that keeps a boss from taking out their petty harassment's of workers really gets managers mad. It's like having a bully, fight your bully. Bully bosses hate that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, if the workers create a union, they can strike and demand better pay and treatment. If I am the owner of a business, I don't want them to do that. I want to continue to pay them the amount I decide, and to treat them the way I want to. But if they unionize, I won't be in the same amount of control. The workers may decide to strike for better pay, and then I'll have to pay myself less as a result.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
