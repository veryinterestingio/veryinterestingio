		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Babies have a receptor called RnFc in their inestines' lining. That receptor attaches to the antibodies in the gut and passes them to the blood. This receptor is also present in the materno-fetal interface (the placenta) and allows passage of antibodies to the fetus' blood. In humans over 3 months old, this receptor can be found in the lining of our vessels (the endothelial cells). This serves as a way of recycling IgG (a type of antibody) extending its plasmatic half life from 6 to 21 days.</p>
<p>RnFc bounds to the Fc portion of the antibodies, which is species-specific. So it's unlikely one could absorb bovine antibodies by drinking milk.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No because most milk is pasturized. The milk that isn't is generally considered unsafe. Its possible that you can get some random antibody but the risk to raw milk is far greater then any minimal benefit you'd get.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, antibodies are too big to pass through into the bloodstream.  They will be digested like any other protein.</p>
<p>Also, human babies get their complement of maternal antibodies while a fetus.   A very very small amount is transferred for a few weeks until the gut matures a bit.   That said, maternal antibodies help protect babies gut until the baby can secrete them there itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The antibodies babies get from breast milk are not part of the immune system in the blood. Those antibodies don’t actually make it “into” the body. They stay in the digestive tract. The antibodies in the blood are produced in the bone marrow. So in short, no it doesn’t really work like that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, the antibodies produced by the cattle, against the pathogen, can’t be transferred to the human consumer through the milk due to the treatment of the milk. Even if the antibodies were supplemented, it wouldn’t be beneficial in the long run, as the human immune system need to produce the antibodies them self, which is only possible if it has been presented to the pathogen/antigen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
