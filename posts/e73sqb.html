		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am confused as to how a video can be claimed for such a small piece of media that might belong to someone else and have them receive 100% of the revenue. If a video gets claimed, Shouldn’t they at most receive a percentage relevant to the time the clip was played and the percent profit? 100% just seems absurd when the rest of the video is someone else’s creation. I have never personally experienced this but am always seeing creators complain about it.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Youtube is the one that decides their policy, and this is the policy that Youtube has in place. YouTube could do another policy, but they didn't. They give little, if any information publicly on why they decide to have this policy.</p>
<p>It really is as simple as that. There are lots of laws around copyright and such that impact this, but they are all fairly minor in comparison to the fact that youtube holds the keys to the realm and is the one that really makes the rules</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you negotiated something before publishing the video with the holder of the copyright to whatever it was you were using, that could be how it worked, if you are caught after using it without permission it isn't.</p>
<p>Think of it like using public transportation without a valid ticket. When you get caught riding the subway/train/tram/whatever without a ticket, they don't make you pay the regular fare price, they make you pay a fine so expensive that it really hurts. If you just had to pay the normal price, there would be no reason for you not to risk it. Making the fine high enough to not be worth the risk is the point.</p>
<p>Copyright claims can get really bizarre.</p>
<p>One of my favorite examples is the song &quot;Bittersweet Symphony&quot; by the Verve. It opens with a very short sample taking from a Rolling Stones record and because the Verve failed to get proper permission, they ended up having to forfeit all profits made from the song to the owner of the Rolling Stones record copyright. The song was a big hit that sold over a million of records and is till being played today and for over two decades the band that made never saw a single penny from it. It was only earlier this year that they got a new deal and finally started seeing some money from it.</p>
<p>Of course just because your work features a short excerpt of another copyrighted work, doesn't automatically mean that you need the owners permission. There are all sorts of exceptions to those rules, but the algorithms checking for copyrighted work on yourtube aren't programmed to understand context and to recognize when something is a parody or other fair use exception.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Someone else might know more on this, but I think they recently changed it such that someone filing a copyright claim is required to timestamp where in the video their copyrighted material is being used.</p>
<p>Then the content creator will have the option of muting that part of the video to keep their revenue and such, thus providing them more protection.</p>
<p>I'm not 100%, but I think this is mostly accurate now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In an ideal world, yes. and there was a time you could get away with pretty much anything on YouTube unless you were reuploading complete media. </p>
<p>However, around 2007, right after Google bought YouTube from it's original creators, Viacom filed a huge 1 billion dollar lawsuit, just as YouTube was gaining steam. It wasn't YouTube's first lawsuit, and losing to Viacom possibly meant the end of YouTube all together. Viacom accussed that YT was not doing enough to stop copyright infringement. The case settled in 2013. </p>
<p>This was also during the ad boom on YouTube. In order for YT to keep growing they kind of just... gave in. It was easier to let the creator lose out on revenue then getting sued. When something is manually claimed by a company, if the content creator tries to appeal, it's sent to the COMPANY, not YouTube. YouTube wants to stay out of copyright disputes no matter what the cost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well one reason is because:</p>
<p>“We are UMG and we are trying to make a buck
Cuz we don't already have enough to spare
If you even think about our music
We don't give a fuck
We'll take your money
And live without a care”
-Charles Cornell</p>
<p>Also YouTube doesn’t give a shit about its creators, just about large companies who will make them more money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
