		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The neurons that make up the memory become other memories.</p>
<p>A memory can be thought of as a lego house where each block is a neuron. The house(memory) exists because the blocks are put together in a certain way. You &quot;forget&quot; when your brain decides the lego house isn't useful anymore and disassembles it to make other lego structures.</p>
<p>Edit to respond to the repeated question: this analogy applies to things you actually and truly forget. In the case of things you haven't thought about and can't recall in the moment but remember later. In that case &quot;forgetting&quot; is more like storing the lego house in the back of you closet and being unable to get to it when you want to play with it, remembering after that is more like digging the house out of the closet than rebuilding the lego house.</p>
<p>Is it a perfect analogy? Nah fam, but it explains a super complex and actually not fully understood process in a way that a 5yo could understand, ya know, like the sub title says.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what your asking probably.</p>
<p>- Where does a memory go when you forget it and never recall it for the rest of your life?</p>
<p>MadMunky 5b5 probably has best answer for this.</p>
<p>- Where does a memory go when you forget it but remember it unexpectedly some time later?</p>
<p>Think of your mind like a map of a city.  Memories are bulidings.  The layout of the roads change, and the exact location of buildings may shift over time.</p>
<p>The roads you use the most / memories you think of the most almost never change.  The roads you use the least are eventually lost.  If a memory is unused long enough, it will be destroyed.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can go a long time without thinking of a particular thing or person.  The memory and path to it are still good even if you do not use it.  That is how you remember the name of that one guy you have not even thought of 5 years after running into him on the street or hearing his name.</p>
<p>When you are aware of something you cannot remember, like the name of that actor who played Jeordi on Star Trek TNG, or the name of that drummer with one arm, it means the building is still there but you cannot find a path to it.  Eventually you find or form a new path to that memory or just google it and recreate the path that way.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Memories dont go anywhere.</p>
<p>Thoughts and memories are simply chains of neurons that repeat. Memories change over time. Because we can learn new things about them or we actually forget them.</p>
<p>I cant remember my childhood phone number. I can't recall that i information right now. I can't seem to piece together the right string to bring that memory up. But, I will remmeber it if someone says it, or shows me an image. </p>
<p>Your brain isnt a set of information, but rather it uses that I formation for other things. </p>
<p>Now true forgetting happens when your brain is damaged. As in those pathways are actually destroyed, or are no longer connected. </p>
<p>When you actually forget something, nothing is missing, your brain just cant drive the same path. Even if it could, you would see it as new info, and not something you remembered.</p>
<p>Maybe I was to in-depth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
