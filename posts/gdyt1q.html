		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>they actually dont. they have these &quot;robots&quot; (well, programms) that constantly check the web and then save certain infos (keywords) at the server park, where the &quot;search engine&quot; is located. this happens all the time and is independent of you searching something. </p>
<p>so all that this search engine does when you start a search is ask its local computers (servers) &quot;have you got anything related to this search&quot; and then the servers check their data for keywords and those results are then grouped/ordered and presented to you as search results. this way it doesn't have to check the entire internet and just checks what it has already there, making it so fast.</p>
<p>the &quot;skill&quot;/usefulness of the search engine is determined by how well it's keyword-catalogue is maintained and by how well its sorting algorithms present you those results.</p>
<p>does this answer your question?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are different methods used by different search engines but this will I hope to clear some of it up. Search engines don't search the internet, they search their own internal data source,  they have some programs that look at all the pages and then put a reference to the page in an internal database.  this is refreshed from time to time and even in some cases stores the previous version of the page.</p>
<p>While they are building up this they can then see how many other pages point to a page/site the more pages that link to a site pushes up the result in the page but there are many other things that do that also</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't, first they search to see if they have recently answered the same question, that data is usually kept in what is called a 'cache' and the process of taking information from a cache that was previously filled by some other program or person is called a 'cache hit'. Some of this can be proactive, for example, if the superbowl is about to happen they will cache up a bunch of football stuff to be ready. That includes spinning up datacenters full of servers to meet demand. </p>
<p>About 30% of google searches are unique, in those cases it will hit an index, which is a directory of all the sites the engine has 'crawled' and look for the right website or information that matches the query. That process takes discernible time, but it is in seconds, not minutes. We can index text, images, video, sound, etc. </p>
<p>Now, say you have to compare a DNA sample to CODIS, that takes forever. Why? Because DNA is unique but almost 100% <em>similar,</em> it is very hard to index.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For instance, Google uses web crawlers, that identify all links to pages, to help generate its search results. Google has a huge index of keywords that helps determine search results. Google also has an algorithm which assigns each web page a relevancy score. The higher the score, the most likely the page will show up first, depending on what you are searching for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
