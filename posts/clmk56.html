		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EDIT - As others have noted below, I totally forgot to include Macular Degeneration in this list, which is indeed a common cause of worsening vision.  Glaucoma has also been included below.</p>
<p>Get a yearly eye exam, folks!  Even if you don’t wear glasses or contacts.  Many diseases can betray their presence in the condition of your eye tissues long before you start to notice any symptoms.  A good ophthalmic exam can help you catch it early and increase your chances of positive treatment outcomes!</p>
<hr />
<p>Most common causes of worsening eyesight:</p>
<p>REFRACTIVE ERROR</p>
<p>Your cornea (the clear part at the front of your eyeball) fails to bring light to a single-point focus on your retina (the rear inner layer of your eye that absorbs light).  This can be because your cornea becomes situated too close or too far from your retina as your eye grows and develops, or because your cornea is not “sphere” shaped (think more like “American football” shaped).  Glasses and contact lenses are made to correct refractive error.  Refractive surgeries like Lasik or Photorefractive Keratectomy have also proven very effective in correcting refractive error.</p>
<p>PRESBYOPIA</p>
<p>Your crystalline lens (a flexible component of the eye that sits right behind your iris) becomes less flexible as you age.  You have little muscles inside your eye that squash and stretch this lens to allow you to focus your vision on near and far objects.  As the lens stiffens, your focusing ability decreases.  This happens to literally everyone, usually around age 40.  Reading glasses are made to correct presbyopia.</p>
<p>CATARACTS</p>
<p>The fibers in the crystalline lens begin to “fog over” and become opaque.  This can happen for a variety of reasons, many of which are age-related.  Cataract surgery is an amazingly quick and easy process nowadays, and the procedure replaces your foggy lens with a clear synthetic lens. </p>
<p>GLAUCOMA</p>
<p>This is a condition where the optic nerve itself becomes damaged, inhibiting its ability to transmit information to the visual cortex.  This is most often caused by excessive intraocular pressure (pressure of the fluid in the anterior chamber of the eye, between your cornea and your lens).  Untreated glaucoma can cause significant, unrecoverable visual field loss, and even total blindness, so it must be monitored closely.  Glaucoma is insidious because it can progress painlessly and go unnoticed for months or years, silently robbing you of your sight.  Acute glaucoma is sometimes indicated by a severe headache and blurred vision.  You may also see halos around sources of light, or feel nauseated.  If you ever experience these symptoms, <em>don’t wait!</em>  Drop what you’re doing and go to an emergency room <em>immediately.</em>  Every second counts.</p>
<p>KERATOCONUS</p>
<p>Your cornea begins to “droop” downwards, like a water balloon rather than a sphere.  This adversely affects vision, because your cornea does most of the work focusing light into your eyes.  Keratoconus is corrected using hard contact lenses, which help the cornea retain a proper shape, a bit like a Jell-O mold.</p>

<p>EDIT: To add to this top comment, others have added that in specific fibers that help adjust the lens begin to stiffen and fluid within the lens begins to crystalize</p>
<p>EDIT2: The lens is a small structure behind your pupil, not the cornea, the thin layer that covers the front of our eyeball</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Optometrist here
Lots of half truths and misunderstood points here
There is no ELI5 to this question and it is a very very broad topic. I'll try to explain the ones I most commonly see.</p>
<p>Myopia (nearsighted/shortsighted)
Mostly caused by a lengthening of the eyeball, most commonly in kids, teens and young adults. The eyeball grows longer and light is no longer focused clearly on the retina (light sensitive part of eye) without glasses or contact lenses. The main causes are genetics and environment (near tasks and time spent indoors)</p>
<p>Hyperopia (longsighted/farsighted)
Generally if you are hypeopic, you are born that way or develop it in the first few weeks/months. You may wear glasses from childhood or may make it to your teens/20s/30s/40s without any symptoms. As the lens in your eye becomes less flexible over time, it becomes more difficult to focus on objects. If you are very hypeopic you may be wearing glasses full time since childhood.</p>
<p>Astigmatism
Your eye is oval shaped instead of round. Generally this doesn't get worse. You are born with it or develop it as an infant. It may slightly increase or decrease over time. Occasionally some eye conditions such as keratoconus or cataracts can cause astigmatism. Most people who are told they have astigmatism as an adult always had it. They just began to have symptoms for other reasons (eg new job, tiredness etc)</p>
<p>Presbyopia
Near vision gets worse over 40 years old, worse in hyperopes than myopes (who may begin to take their glasses off to read). Caused by stiffening of the flexible lens inside your eye.</p>
<p>Macular degeneration
Older people may get this. The part of of your retina that deals with detailed central vision degrades over time. Wear and tear is worsened by genetic factors, smoking, diet and some other less important factors</p>
<p>Glaucoma
The optic nerve becomes progressively damaged due to high pressure inside your eye, or poor blood circulation or other factors. Sight loss begins peripherally and moves inwards. Treated with eyedrops or surgery. </p>
<p>Cataracts
The lens in the eye becomes progressively more cloudy. Can be fixed with surgery.</p>
<p>There are many, many other causes including corneal disease, inflammatory conditions, vascular problems, diabetes, genetic retinal conditions, trauma, optic nerve diseases, neurological conditions. That's about all I could cover in this post.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few factors that contribute to blurry uncorrected vision; namely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-sightedness#/media/File:Myopia.gif" target="_blank">myopia</a> (nearsightedness, needing minus spherical lens correction) where the eye is too long and the cornea and lens refract light in front of the retina, <a href="https://www.bausch.com/Portals/69/-/m/BL/United%20States/Images/Eye%20Concerns/Vision%20Correction/farsightedness.png" target="_blank">hyperopia</a> (farsightedness, needing positive spherical lens correction) where the eye is too short and the cornea and lens refract light behind the retina, and <a href="https://www.nvisioncenters.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_510816799-1024x510.jpg" target="_blank">astigmatism</a> (needing cylindrical lens correction) where the eye is shaped more like a football than a baseball where there are multiple focal points. (Fun fact, the cornea is responsible for more light refracting than the lens, having an average dioptric power of 43 where the lens is about 20, giving the eye an average refractive power of about 60diopters)</p>
<p>As a baby and child, the eye is typically hyperopic but the lens inside the eye can accommodate (change shape and refractive power) to allow them to focus light on their retina to see their world (which is mostly upclose to them). As the eye ages, it grows and has a myopic shift. When you are young your lens can still accommodate to focus light on your retina, but to an extent. If the eye grows too much it may become too myopic (too long) for the refracting system of the eye (cornea and lens) and refract light in front of the retina (unless an object is close up, hence nearsightedness). Conversely, if it doesnt grow enough and is hyperopic (too short) for the refractive system, the light is focused behind the eye (most people who are hyperopic are considered 'farsighted,' but they really cant see far or near very well). With astigmatism, as one gets older the cornea actually changes shape and has a shift in astigmatism from <a href="https://webeye.ophth.uiowa.edu/eyeforum/atlas/pages/Corneal-Astig-WTR/index.htm" target="_blank">with-the-rule</a> to <a href="https://webeye.ophth.uiowa.edu/eyeforum/atlas/pages/Corneal-Astig-ATR/index.htm" target="_blank">against-the-rule</a>. </p>
<p>These changes are gradual and usually stabilizes in early 20s which is why we recommend LASIK to people above 23ish and have a stable refraction, just so we know the laser treatment will last. Switching from with-the-rule to against-the-rule astigmatism happens later in adulthood. Lastly, as you approach 40 years old, the lens gradually loses it ability to accommodate which is why you start needing reading glasses. Eventually as the proteins in the lens start to denature you develop a cataract, which is like looking though a dirty window, requiring cataract surgery to replace the lens with a lens implant. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For those with poor eye sight to begin with, as you grow so do your eyes. This can make eyesight worse dude to shaping of the eye not being spherical.</p>
<p>For example, with an astigmatism your eyes grow more misshapen as you age and grow this can mean your eyes grow more misshapen. When I was younger it was explained to me that normally eyes grow like a soccer ball, but mine grew more like a football.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
