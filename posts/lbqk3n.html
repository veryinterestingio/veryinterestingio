It’s super strong for about 5 minutes and then it goes away and my sense of smell remains completely gone for the rest of the day. </p>
<p>Any idea what causes this and how covid affects the brain in this way?</p></div></div>

ACE2 receptors are expressed on basal (stem), support and epithelial cells in your nose. So the virus can infect those quite well, not the sensory neurons though (which don't or barely have ACE2). Inflammatory responses might restrict metabolic support of the sensory cells and disrupt the way in which support cells keep up the ion gradients, which are necessary for signal transduction. Also damaged stem cells disrupt cell turnover/renewal in the olfactory epithel.</p>

This paper suggests the same mechanism for neurological problems. So neurons apparently aren't vulnerable directly but vascular cells are (again ACE2). It's from July, so there's probably more concrete evidence by now.</p>
<p>(Maybe decaying ion gradients could lead to short-haywire signals being sent to your brain creating the vomit smell? Just a thought that would be hard to test I imagine)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Regarding other neurological symptoms like headaches, forgetfulness, loss of focus etc, according to one of our radiologists, COVID-19 patients commonly have signs of vasculitis in their head scans. Depending on its location, it can cause those effects.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One possibility is that people with upper respiratory infections often have congestion, drainage and other nasal symptoms that can block odor’s ability to reach the smell nerve, which sits at the top of the nasal cavity. But, we believe the primary cause, particularly for people with extended or permanent loss of smell function, is that the virus causes an inflammatory reaction inside the nose that can lead to a loss of the olfactory, or smell, neurons.</p>
<p>In some cases, this is permanent, but in other cases, the neurons can regenerate. That’s likely what determines which patients recover. In COVID-19, we believe smell loss is so prevalent because the receptors for COVID-19 that are expressed in human tissue are most commonly expressed in the nasal cavity and in the supporting cells of the olfactory tissue. These supporting cells surround the smell neurons and allow them to survive.</p>

<p>The implication of brain symptoms are... disturbing, to say the least.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An intriguing idea is taking shape. During the July webinar, Fauci noted that some long haulers’ symptoms like brain fog and fatigue are “highly suggestive” of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS).</p>

<p>Quote and link come from this equally discomforting Sept. 2020 article on the persistent long term effects of a COVID infection that are becoming more obvious as this shit continues to spread and it's harder to ignore the 'long haulers' like us.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see several great responses which explain why people have a sense of smell which is off or gone (cacosmia and anosmia), so I won’t comment more on that. However, your sense of smell should get better in the next month or too. There is also some evidence that smell training can help. I don’t believe that there’s great COVID specific data, but there is data on smell training for other viruses causing a smell that is gone or off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
