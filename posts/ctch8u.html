		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a result of what the other posters are saying, Chicago has a huge underground.  Back in the 80's and 90's my mom took the train from the suburbs to a stop right under her office building.  When she would go to lunch, she would walk underground to several restaurants.  </p>
<p>There's a whole underground &quot;mall&quot; thing there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A little bit of history here, too - back before they could drive pile into the bedrock, they used to make “floating” foundations. The wet sand of Lake Michigan was too deep for them to reach bedrock originally, but Chicago still had some of the tallest buildings around because of the shape of the foundations they put in.</p>
<p>So imagine a snow shoe. You know how they make it possible to stay on top of snow by distributing your weight over more ground? That’s basically how they did it before they could reach the bedrock. They made huge, pyramid-shaped corner foundations that would “float” on the sand. The pressure from the building helped keep it from moving around, and the area kept it stable/kept it from sinking.</p>
<p>This doesn’t answer your question, but is directly related because it is an issue Chicago has been dealing with since its foundation (no pun intended). “The Great White City” is a great read if you wanna know more about Chicago’s history/planning along the timeline that the serial killer H.H. Holmes was active. Especially if you are, like me, a casual historian.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh something I can answer! I'm a structural engineer that was the lead on the 2006 Wrigley field bleacher addition! The soils at Wrigley were actually perfectly fine for shallow spread footings. In fact, the whole stadium bears on shallow spread footings. We called them wedding cake footings because of their shape...a practice that isn't used anymore.
Fun story, the fifteen foot tall wall that surrounds the bleachers along waveland and Sheffield was demolished as part of our work and replaced. We didn't have drawings for it so we didn't know what to expect for the footing. We assumed it would have been at least four feet wide to keep it from tipping over in the wind. Nope. Turns out it was an 18&quot; wide 'bank pour'! The constructors had dug a shallow trench with a shovel and poured concrete in it to make a level surface. No reinforcing, no dowels to tie them together. Everything I learned in school is a lie!
I do have old drawings of the main field I could post if anyone actually makes it down to my post and reads it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>No matter how swampy the soil is, you drill it far enough you will hit bed rock, they do the same when building bridges across rivers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
