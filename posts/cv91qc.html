		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bugs do not feel fear, or happiness, or anger, or Joy, or excitement, or sadness. They are automatons, and they react to stimuli automatically and without reflection or thinking of any kind. Their behavior has been programmed through millennia of survival and adaptation, and if a little bug flies up to a larger animal, it is because that behavior has led to the long-term survival of the bug as a species. When that behavior no longer enhances survival, it will be weeded out, and those bugs will no longer do that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first reason would be its very rare that large mammals feed on flying insects. </p>
<p>Second, Most large mammals cannot effectively  kill small flying insects. The may be able to shake or have tails, but in general there is not much danger to the insect.</p>
<p>Third, there is usually a need for the insect to do it. Mosquitoes and some flies feed on blood. Many flies are looking for a place to lay eggs. </p>
<p>Finally, from an evolutionary standpoint, risky behavior for a single fly is very different than risky behavior forna single human. Because humans (and most mammals) reproduce slowly and take a long time to mature,  a single death is much more important to the species as it represents a large investment of energy and resources. For insects who may lay thousands of eggs and mature and live very quickly, a sungle death is less important. Even if some insects die (and a lot will) it only takes a small number to bring the population back up, so there isnt an evolutionary advantage to &quot;playing it safe&quot;</p>
<p>It has been a pretty good evolutionary strategy until humans came along. Even after humans, it still works for them given how many flies and mosquitoes are still around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bugs do not have the brain capacity human do and do not experience what you would call fear. They are mostly just driven by instinct.</p>
<p>Mosquitoes need blood to procreate so they are driven to get blood and have young and die. That's just what they do. No emotion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
