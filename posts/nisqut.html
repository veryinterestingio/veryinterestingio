<p>Second, it's easier to look for what we <em>know</em> is used for life rather than speculate a ton of alternate biologies, look for their own volatile gasses, and just <em>hope</em> it indicates life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a bit of a misconception, but it's easy to see where it comes from given how people talk about exoplanets.</p>
<p>So first, we can't quite look for oxygen yet in exoplanets.  The technology isn't there yet but hopefully will be soon.</p>
<p>But aside from that, there's a general disconnect between how scientists actually do research looking for &quot;earthlike planets&quot; and how it gets described.  So you always hear &quot;we found this earthlike planet&quot; which could be the right size or have liquid water or whatever.  And naturally people think scientists are just out looking for those planets specifically.  But in general they are just finding thousands of planets with a huge range of traits and simply highlighting in the news &quot;oh, and this one had a trait that was earthlike&quot;.</p>
<p>When we can get amospheric spectra, you can bet something similar will happen.  They will find a bunch of planets with no air and planets with thick venuslike air and planets with hydrogen rich atmospheres...and occasionally one with oxygen will pop up in the news and get a bunch of press because it could be earthlike!  And people will think scientists are only looking for those planets, but really they are looking at all the planets and those are just the ones that get in the news.   </p>
<p>Also you can bet that if scientists find a weird atmosphere (say, flourine rich) that looks different from all the other atmospheres, people will speculate it has life in it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As u/atomfullerene mentions, we don’t have the ability to do that yet, and it’s a common misconception that oxygen is what we’re looking for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you don't search for oxygen, what do you search for?    </p>
<p>No one knows the answer to that question.  Yes, maybe there is some very strange form of life out there that doesn't need oxygen, but we'd have no clue what to even start looking for.  Since we can't look for something that we don't know exists, but look for life like ours, because we DO know what that looks like and have some ideas on how to detect it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
