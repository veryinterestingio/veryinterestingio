		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People already hit on the main reasons which are decreased activity and increased food consumption, but I have a feeling that's not really what you were asking for. </p>
<p>The main reason many teenagers are notorious for being able to eat a ton of food without gaining weight is that their body is rapidly growing. All the processes required to fuse growth plates, increase bone density, and develop the brain use a lot of energy. At around age 25-30, this development mostly stops and our body reverses to break-down processes rather than build-up processes. (Muscle is an exception to this if you do strength training)</p>
<p>Another thing to take into account is that as we do things, our bodies acclimate to it. For example, someone who begins running 1 mile a day will burn more calories the first time they run it than the 100th time they run it because their body will naturally find the path of greatest efficiency. Someone who's young will likely be doing many different tasks and exercises for the first time, so they tend to burn more calories until they reach that acclimation. </p>
<p>Edit: This in no way is me saying that exercise is bad just because you acclimate to it. It's just an observation on a common issue that leads to a plateau, which almost every person who works out will experience at one point. The general solution to this, for anyone of any age, is to try to have a varied exercise routine. Instead of doing the same workouts every week change your pace, the day you're working different muscle groups, how much of your max weight you lift with, the type of cardio you do (running vs jump rope vs HIIT all make your body do different things). </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit: Not a doctor, shhhshhh...</p>
<p>Your metabolism does not slow down with age, or at least not like you probably think. The main culprit is changing exercise and nutrition habits. Of course there are the additional costs of growing for kids, which is why a 16 year old will have a greater BMR (base metabolic rate) than a 30 year old of the same height and weight. BMR is the energy you burn by basically just existing, e.g. lying in bed all day.</p>
<p>While most of us were probably more active when we were younger - think of playing outside, PE class and so on - adults are mostly sedentary. We drive to work, sit in an office the whole day and sit at home afterwards. This is why younger people seem to have a larger TDEE (total daily energy expenditure). TDEE is your BMR plus energy burned from moving about and exercise.</p>
<p>Humans are really bad at noticing subtle changes over time, which is why most of us don't see that we are moving less and often eat more as we get older. Therefore the resulting weight gain is attributed to the mysterious slowing metabolism. While there are specific health problems or other factors that lead to weight gain, they mostly work by increasing appetite or making you lethargic and therefore use less energy. But these are often minor contributors compared to nutrition and exercise habits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>BMR will reduce linearly with age, but that’s almost solely due to a reduction in muscle mass. As for “metabolism” decrease with age, the contributing factors to an increased weight gain given the same nutritional patterns are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Less muscle mass</li>
<li>Lowered activity levels</li>
</ol>
<p>For older individuals that hold onto a decent amount of muscle mass and stay fit to a similar degree, the changes will not be nearly as noticeable. For an individual that undergoes TRT and is able to hold onto the same amount of muscle mass and activity levels, the changes would be insignificant at best.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Metabolism&quot; is treated as this mysterious force that controls our weight gain.  In reality, it's essentially just the sum total of all the energy (calories) that your body burns in a day in order to keep operating/living. </p>
<p>The reason your 'metabolism' slows down as you age is simple:  You get lazier, slower and more immobile, so you burn less energy (calories).  The reduced activity also tends to lead to less muscle mass (for men, a decrease in testosterone as you age will lead to a reduction in muscle mass), which again leads to less energy use.</p>
<p>That's it.  There's some subtle nuance to it that's not discussed here (the reduction is not <em>all</em> explained by less activity, but that's the lion's share of it), but that's the the broad strokes of it.  You do less as you get older, which means your body is using less energy - ergo, your 'metabolism' (or 'total energy/calories burned') is reduced.  It's better to think of metabolism as simply a unit of measurement - that'll help dispel most of the false notions surrounding metabolism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The question has already been answered, but here's a helpful, related, perspective based thing to consider:</p>
<p>Your metabolism isn't getting <em>worse.</em> If you're putting in the same amount as you did when you were young, spending the same amount as you did when you were young, and managing to gain more weight than you did when you were young, that's your metabolism doing <em>better,</em> not worse. It means that your body is wasting less of what it's bringing in, leaving more to save in reserve.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
