		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. Mars' magnetic field is around <del>1500</del> 15,800-19,900 nanotesla (thanks /u/robolith, I gave the orbital value, useful for some of the later solar wind discussion but not for the magnet discussion!). That's within the range that the earth's magnetic field fluxuates in a solar storm, which isn't exactly something that we need to adjust our compasses for. Even if you were to have an extremely sensitive magnet that field would almost certainly be overwhelmed by magnetic minerals in the Martian crust such as magnetite, hematite, and pyrrhotite. Even those are mainly responsible for localized anomalies in the northern portion of the southern hemisphere, so you couldn't reliably count on them to point in a specific direction if you were close enough to swing a magnetic needle.</p>
<p>Essentially the reason Mars is a dead planet now is because it doesn't have a magnetic field shielding it from solar winds. Without an active dynamo (spinning core, roughly) creating enough energy to shield the planet, solar winds blasted away volatiles on the surface and, for this specific question, mean that we can't use a compass to navigate on Mars.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I suppose you mean if a compass can be used to find geographic north? No, though your compass will be able to show the local direction of some of the strongest crustal fields, which are estimated to measure at most about 15,800-19,900 nT at the surface (/u/photonsource's value of 1500 nT was measured in orbit). </p>

<p>Outside of crustal fields, a more sensitive compass (science-grade magnetometer) might be able to sense the induced magnetosphere, which will change orientation depending on the upstream interplanetary magnetic field. Currently, we don't know if that's the case, but we're hoping to find out when the first results from the magnetometer on the InSight lander are released.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hm, this brings up some interesting spin-off questions, are there many planets that have a significant magnetic field/mineral deposits that would make a compass usable? Would the magnetic pole most likely be at the north or south pole, or could it be along the equator? Are us earthlings just lucky that we ended up with a magnetic north pole that's very close to the true north pole?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I saw an awesome video explaining Earths magnetic field and they compared it to mars’ field and mars use to have a mic stronger field I guess, just after some event (sorry I forget, an impact or eruption) the field was hurt so to say and it took away mars’ atmosphere I’m pretty sure. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
