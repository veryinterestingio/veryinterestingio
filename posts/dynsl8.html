IIRC, it just acts as a reuptake inhibitor for some hormone that regulates alertness. This type of effect seems to only go so far.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It mostly keeps you from feeling sleepy by blocking the substance that makes you feel sleepy, called adenosine.</p>
<p>It also revs up your heart by epinephrine (adrenaline), so it does have some stimulation role.</p>
<p>However, adenosine doesn't go away, it builds up but is being blocked. After prolonged lack of sleep, once the effects of caffeine wear off, all that adenosine will hit you like a sack of bricks.</p>
<p>That is why it's dangerous to drive while being poorly slept and trying to stay awake with caffeine. You feel ok for a while, but at some point you will have a massive drop in alertness and may even go into microsleep.
When you are drunk you have slow reflexes, but when you sleep for a few seconds you don't react at all.</p>
<p>I highly recommend the book Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker, it's a real eye-opener.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>tldr: Definitely the latter. These next paragraphs do <strong>not</strong> sound easy, and I'm not going to try to eli5 this at all because neuroscience is hard to. I'll just simplify it.</p>
<p>When you're awake for a full day, the effects of caffeine become very limited. First, we need to talk about how you get tired--adenosine.</p>
<p>When you wake up, you have quite a bit of adenosine in your system. It makes you sleepy, tired, don't want to get up. It gives you that &quot;just 5 more minutes&quot; feeing.</p>
<p>It does this by literally slowing down nerve activity, especially the rate at which neurons fire--I'm not an expert so someone can probably explain that part better. All I know is that it binds to receptors through a nitrogenous(?) base.</p>
<p>After the first 15 minutes after waking up, you burn up all of this excess adenosine, and you start to feel awake. As your day goes on, your body starts to make more and more, suppressing the nerves, and making you sleepy.</p>
<p>This is where caffeine comes in. Caffeine binds to the exact same receptors, through the almost exact nitrogenous base. <em>However</em>, it is vastly different in many ways. Caffeine has an oxygen atom there, some elements are swapped, but it does the opposite of what adenosine does--it wakes you up.</p>
<p>Caffeine is a smaller molecule than adenosine, meaning it can block out more receptors than the adenosine can fill (if you look at the molecules, you'll understand what I'm getting at). This counteracts adenosine, and speeds up that neural activity.</p>
<p>Now to your question--will caffeine work after excessive wakefulness? No. When you're awake for ~24 hours, your brain kicks adenosine into overdrive. Suddenly, there are way more adenosine molecules to caffeine molecules, and it's almost the same as before. In fact, if you've ever stayed up for over 24 hours, you can feel this wave of adenosine hit--it's really overpowering.</p>
<p>This &quot;wave&quot; can hit at different times for different people, too. Some people can have it hit in 10--I fall into this category and so caffeine has nearly no effect on me. For others, this wave can never hit and they can go without sleep for a ludicrous amount of time. Though, the average person should never try that (it really messes with your sense of time, seriously don't).</p>
<p>Also, ever hear of a caffeine crash? The adenosine throughout the day doesn't just disappear, it stays there, and when the caffeine wears off, it all hits at once. In fact, the reason I have such an early adenosine wave is because I drink ~1 monster a day--My caffeine crash causes an adenosine wave. Don't worry, I have a really healthy heart despite this and I'm not planning on dying any time soon (famous last words).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It actually does neither. Caffeine blocks chemicals that tell your body to be tired. So it doesn't energize you, it doesn't give extra energy, it just overrides the brain's desire to rest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
