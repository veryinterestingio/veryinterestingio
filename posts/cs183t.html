<ul>
<li>
<p>They want drugs with long half lives so that you're not taking it every half hour. Serotonin would be rapidly processed. Reuptake inhibitors get stuck in molecular channels and hang out longer.</p>
</li>
<li>Your brain has a blood brain barrier to filter out possibly dangerous molecules, viruses, bacteria, etc. Serotonin does not get through the blood brain barrier, so any you took would not make it to your brain.</li>

<p>Your premise is faulty. Depression is not caused by low levels of serotonin. It's tempting to think this, because SSRI antidepressants work by increasing the availability of serotonin, but the evidence doesn't support it. In fact, some antidepressants actually BLOCK serotonin. The whole &quot;mental condition / emotion X is caused by too much / too little of neurotransmitter Y&quot; thing is basically never accurate. The closest thing to a genuine case of this is Parkinson's disease, which is actually caused by the death of a certain group of dopamine producing neurons in your basal ganglia, and Parkinson's is in fact treated in part by giving a drug that the brain directly turns into dopamine. This should highlight for you the fact that actual deficits / surpluses of neurotransmitters don't cause subtle effects like depressed mood or happiness, they majorly break shit. In the case of Parkinson's, it's not even a brain-wide loss of dopamine, just one very specific circuit. A brain-wide dopamine deficit would probably just kill you, or at least render you unable to function. Too much serotonin in your brain? You don't get happy, you get seizures and die. </p>
<p>If you think about it, this isn't that weird. You take ibuprofen for a headache, and ibuprofen works by inhibiting COX enzymes... but your headache wasn't caused by overactive COX enzymes, it was caused by the construction going on next door, or your screaming toddler, or too much Reddit. </p>
<p>As for why we don't give serotonin as a drug: </p>
<p>The various circuits in your brain use a bewildering array of different neurotransmitters, and dozens or hundreds of subtypes of neurotransmitter receptors / transporters. Every neurotransmitter is used in many different brain circuits with different functions, and every brain circuit uses many neurotransmitters. There's also a tremendous amount of feedback in these brain circuits, which means that the effect of any drug is EXTREMELY dependent on EXACTLY which receptors / transporters it targets, in what way, and how much it prefers a given subtype. Even the exact same drug can act as a dopamine inhibitor in some brain circuits and a dopamine booster in others. Many neurons have receptors for their own neurotransmitters that decrease further release, so a serotonin booster could sometimes decrease serotonin release (in some brain circuits), if it happens to affect those feedback receptors especially strongly. </p>
<p>The bottom line is that brains are insanely complicated. They are more complicated than anything else in the universe that we know of. 99% of the time, if someone presents you with a simple answer for something brain related, it's wrong. Not just &quot;oversimplified&quot;, but actually just factually wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few reasons, first, neurotransmitters tend to not cross the blood-brain barrier so they wouldn't get to where they are needed.</p>
<p>Secondly, off-target effects.  Serotonin isn't just used in the brain, in your GI tract serotonin receptors measure if your GI cells are &quot;stressed out&quot; for lack of a better term, more serotonin release means more unhappy gut cells, triggering faster GI contractions to speed things along (causing diarrhea) and eventually spilling over to the area postrema and triggering the vomit reflex.</p>
<p>Third, neurotransmitters are designed to be created when needed then recycled (&quot;reuptake&quot; refers to the recycling process).  Just supplying more transmitter would increase activity for a little while, a few minutes to half an hour maybe, but interfering with the recycling process can increase levels for days. </p>
<p>Fourth, level control, you can tweak levels by adjusting the reuptake rate a little bit, where using raw neurotransmitters even if possible would result in extremely high levels.  The results would varry from unpleasant (serotonin) to fatal (GABA, acetylcholine)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you don’t understand the full issue (doubt that I do).</p>
<p>It’s not only that your brain lacks serotonin.  Rather it very quickly absorbs what’s available, dropping levels very low. Each time more is made, it gets sucked up. A re-uptake inhibitor slows down the use and absorption, keeping the levels more consistent. </p>
<p>As others have said, it’s very difficult to get anything through the blood brain barrier. So even if you could bathe the brain in serotonin, it likely wouldn’t get through the barrier and if it did, it would immediately soak up that serotonin, then drop levels even more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Without advanced knowledge on the subject, my understanding is that one's body is normally programmed to produce serotonin in response to other stimuli, circadian rhythms, etc. in the right place, at the right time, at the right dose. In depression, people either produce insufficient levels of it, or have a dampened response to it, but it is still produced by the right cells at the right time. Therefore, giving a dose of serotonin itself indiscriminately &quot;bathes&quot; your system with it, causing disruption to normal functions, rather than helping the body better utilise what it has.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
