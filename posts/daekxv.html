		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Reddit, I am Kit Yates. I'm a senior lecturer in Mathematical Biology at the University of Bath. I'm here to dispel some rumours about my fascinating subject area and demonstrate how maths is becoming an increasingly important tool in our fight to understand biological processes in the real world.</p>
<p>I've also just published a new popular maths book called the Math(s) of Life and Death which is <a href="https://amzn.to/2MkmdcM" target="_blank">out in the UK</a> and available to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Math-Life-Death-Mathematical-Principles/dp/1982111879/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?crid=VWXFWH6IJA6W&amp;keywords=the+maths+of+life+and+death+kit+yates&amp;qid=1564181090&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=the+math+of+life+and+death+%2Caps%2C120&amp;sr=8-1-fkmr0" target="_blank">pre-order in the US</a>. In the book I explore the true stories of life-changing events in which the application (or misapplication) of mathematics has played a critical role: patients crippled by faulty genes and entrepreneurs bankrupt by faulty algorithms; innocent victims of miscarriages of justice and the unwitting victims of software glitches. I follow stories of investors who have lost fortunes and parents who have lost children, all because of mathematical misunderstanding. I wrestle with ethical dilemmas from screening to statistical subterfuge and examine pertinent societal issues such as political referenda, disease prevention, criminal justice and artificial intelligence. I show that mathematics has something profound or significant to say on all of these subjects, and more.</p>
<p>On a personal note I'm from Manchester, UK, so it's almost a pre-requisite that I love football (Manchester City) and Music (Oasis were my favourite band). I also have two young kids, so they keep me busy outside of work. My website for both research and pop maths is <a href="https://kityates.com/" target="_blank"><a href="https://kityates.com/" target="_blank">https://kityates.com/</a></a></p>
<p>I'll be online from 8-9pm (GMT+1) on Saturday 28th September to answer your questions as part of <a href="https://www.futures2019.co.uk/" target="_blank">FUTURES - European Researchers' Night 2019</a>.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do you feel students in the UK (as well as the US, if you’re knowledgeable on our coursework) receive an adequate maths education? </p>
<p>How do you think maths educations need to be changed or improved, if at all? </p>
<p>What kinds of projects are you working on with respect to mathematical biology? Are there any projects on the horizon that you’re interested in? </p>
<p>Given the current public distrust of science/scientists (at least in the States, but also abroad as far as I can tell; US source: <a href="https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/state-of-science-index-survey/about-2019-survey/" target="_blank">https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/state-of-science-index-survey/about-2019-survey/</a>) , do you worry that the results of your research, even if they’re groundbreaking, will go unused and mistrusted? </p>
<p>Thanks for doing this AMA!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
