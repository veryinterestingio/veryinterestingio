		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Consider a world where there are only two things: money and stuff (assets, stocks, bonds, etc).</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve can buy lots of stuff, which sends a lot of cash-money out into the world. Or it can sell lots of stuff, which takes cash-money out of the world.</p>
<p>When times are bad, people have a lot less money to spend and no one wants to buy their stuff. If no one buys their stuff, they can't make money to give to someone else. This repeats until no one is buying anything. Its like a traffic jam, where everyone is waiting on everyone else.</p>
<p>When times are good, people have a lot of money to spend on stuff. Maybe there is so much money that everything will become too expensive as people have more and more dollars to spend (and more and more want to buy) so people start charging more.</p>
<p>So, when times are bad the Fed can buy lots of stuff with new money. This &quot;injects&quot; cash into the system by trading some of that unwanted stuff for money. When people that were previously unable to get money for their stuff have money, they can in turn spend it. This repeats to (hopefully) undo that traffic jam of no one buying anything.</p>
<p>When times are good the Fed can sell lots of stuff to get that money back out of the system. This helps to prevent prices getting too high or for there to be too much money out there (the less money, the more valuable it is!). This also means they're in a safe spot later to send that money back out when times get traffic jammed again.</p>
<p>The people who benefit are those that the Fed originally buy from and then wherever that money goes next. In a perfect situation, that money goes everywhere and kickstarts the traffic jam to get moving until everyone is clear. The cost is born by a reduced value in the dollar (more money out there means people will start charging more and every dollar is worth less) as well as the Fed sitting on lots of stuff.</p>
<p>The Fed currently has so MUCH stuff after 2008 that they are still sitting on that mountain of stuff waiting for times to get even better than they have been to offload it more. This messes with indicators like the &quot;yield curve,&quot; where people are predicting the benefits of the stuff that the Fed is also sitting on top of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't just give out newly printed money.  They trade it for financial assets.  Usually government bonds.</p>
<p>The bank or whoever sold the bond gets the benefit.  But they don't get it for free.  They have to give up the bond.</p>
<p>Usually the remaining payments they'd get on the bond over a period of weeks / months / years, almost equals the newly printed money.</p>
<p>Basically you might spend $90,000 on a bond that pays you $10,000 a year for <del>8</del> 10 years.  After 2 years you've got $20,000 in payments so far, you decide to sell, the Fed buys it for $75,000 of newly printed money.  But the 8 remaining payments (totalling $80,000) go to the Fed and are &quot;burned&quot; (the opposite of printing money).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This usually does not involve the fed giving out actual money.</p>
<p>The federal reserve is part of a reserve banking system, which means they require their depositors (banks) to maintain a certain percentage of their asserts liquid in reserve.  This gives the fed two levers:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They can adjust the reserve rate. If banks have to keep only 8% of their total deposits cash, they have more money to lend than if they are required to keep 10%.  This is a powerful lever for impacting cash in circulation.</p>
</li>
<li>Banks generally keep as close to the reserve rate as possible, which means if their daily activity had a lot of withdrawals they may dip below the limit and not yet have time to liquidate investments, or a lot of deposits  has extra but not yet lended the money. The banks are allowed to lend between themselves  at the federal funds rate, allowing requirements to be met and money to not go idle.  This reverberates throughout the economy (as overnight lending for reserve requirements is pretty much the most stable lending you can do, so if it's rate changed other rates tend to follow).</li>
</ol>
<p>You'll note the fed uses a fund rate target, but it is generally banks lending to each other.  To ensure banks are trading at the feds target, they basically have two mechanism:</p>
<p>A. The fed's discount rate, where it lends directly to these institutions. This directly effects the overall market rate (federal funds rate).
B. They can buy and sell US Bonds. As reserve requirements are usually met by holding these bonds, less of them means less reserves available (driving the fund rate up) and more means more available (driving the rate down).</p>
<p>to:dr;. They manipulate the requirements of a reserve banking system to change how much money is in circulation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the good answers on this thread <a href="https://positivemoney.org/our-proposals/sovereign-money-creation/" target="_blank">this paper</a> is good on other better ways this could be done.</p>
<p>As others have said the standard way cash is injected is by central bank purchasing pre-existing financial assets (predominantly government bonds) from non-banks (typically pension funds and insurance companies), in the process creating money (in the form of central bank reserves). The issue then is that none of this new money is in the real economy, it is in central bank reserves and in pension funds and insurance companies. The idea is that this then trickles into the real economy by making banks more likely to loan, and by lowering the cost of taking out loans. The problem is that modern research shows that this only happens to an absolutely tiny degree, so it's highly inefficient.</p>
<p>So, the paper argues, what would be much more efficient would be for the government to create money, give it to itself, and use it to increase public spending and/or lower taxes. You're still creating money out of nothing (which actually the private sector does all the time, so don't worry about that) but you're injecting the money you create directly into the real economy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>if the fed buys anything, the seller gets the money first</p>
<p>if the fed lends the money, the borrower gets it first.</p>
<p>the fed and the first receiver benefit since they spend the money before inflation hits.</p>
<p>those who receive the money last bear the costs. especially those with fixed incomes.</p>
<p>the economic effect is basically the same as counterfeiting money. the counterfeiter benefits and those who sell him goods. the cost falls on society as a whole since they face higher prices without getting the new money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
