		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When someone has poor vision and sees things blurry it is because their eyes either do not bend the light enough or bend it too much. This produces a blurry image because the focal point is supposed to be on the retina but is instead ahead or behind it.</p>
<p>When you squint you are actually doing two things. First you are causing your cornea to flex slightly which helps with the bending of light to a better focal point. Second you are creating a smaller aperture for light to pass through which creates less scattering and sharper edges. The down side to this is muscle strain (which is why we wear glasses cause you don't want to squint forever) and also a dimmer image because less light is passing through the aperture.</p>
<p>Glasses/contacts compensate for the amount of light bending needed to make sure the focal point maintains on the retina. Btw, this is more of a lens physics question rather than biology but there's a lot of overlap there so...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a physics question as much as biology. It's a phenomenon called the &quot;pinhole effect&quot; where only having a small aperture for light to enter lowers the area that that light covers when hitting your retina. This gives the effect of sharpening the image, because image blurriness is a function of the area of light hitting your retina.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With a large lens opening, light can come from a single point on say a coke can and enter the camera in trillion different places / left / right / up /down and all in between. All those rays of light are coming from a single tiny place and striking the back of the eye in all the places possible. And you get a fuzzy image.</p>
<p>Now shrink the size of the opening to a mere pinhole and you also shrink the available up/down/left /right space random images of that point on the can are coming into the eye's retina surface.</p>
<p>This is the same as what happens when you use a camera lens and make the aperture smaller.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is the exact same thing as the Aperture/F-stop on a 35 mm camera:
Small opening, clearer focus and large if not infinite depth of field.
Large opening creates difficult focus, and very narrow depth of field.</p>
<p>It’s all about the circles of confusion, or Bokeh.</p>
<p>Squinting makes your eyelid opening smaller than your iris opening, basically like stopping down on the camera: so the circles of light that pass through are smaller = better focus</p>
<p>Think of it like the image on camera film or your eye retina is made up of tiny building blocks of focused-light image. The smaller the opening that the light goes through, such as tiny pupil or squinted eyes, has to make the potential area and individual building block of the image smaller, making higher resolution, like smaller pixels, or more pixels per inch: clearer image.</p>
<p>Also like when making a pinhole camera out of a shoebox or oatmeal tube. The smaller the pinhole, the sharper the image. There’s not even any lens to focus. Changing only the opening size, changes the sharpness of the image. So again, squinting makes the opening smaller, that the light goes through to reach your eye, which makes the image sharper.</p>
