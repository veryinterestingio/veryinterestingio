		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would love to explain you this, but it is in fact not known. I am currently doing my master's of science in Neurophysiology and earlier had some lectures by experts in the field of migraine. And it is just not known.. However, there are some things we do know:</p>
<p>Familial migraine probably has something to do with the flow of ions, charged particles used to transfer electric signals in the brain. We only know this because sufferers from familial migraine have certain parts of their DNA that are different from other (normal/average) people. We call these differences mutations, mutate comes from Latin and means &quot;altered&quot;. These mutations are in genes which we know have something to do with ion flows. Lots of different genes can be mutated, all with different functions, but most have to do with positive charged ions.</p>
<p>As neurons use ions to transfers signals, altered ion flow can lead to altered signal change. A small signal in a health brain can become larger in the altered migraine brain. This makes the brain more sensitive to input.</p>
<p>We do not know what causes the pain, as the brain itself has no pain nerves. The tissue and membrane's around the brain do have pain nerves. In some people, simple pain killers work, in others drugs that release pressure work. This suggests that maybe the membranes of the skull play a role in the pain. In some people, drugs that work on the blood vessels work in migraine. In others they don't. We have no idea why.</p>
<p>It could also be that the altered sensitivity creates some sort of random signals that are sent to the pain centres of the brain, where all your pain nerves from the body come together. This can create a epileptic like activity here, causing the sensation of pain without pain nerves that are sensing pain. </p>
<p>This epileptic-like activity could also be the cause of the aura's. If you stimulate the vision centres of the brain with electric signals, some people also see aura's, even is these signals do not come from light that gets in your eye. This is like the same principle when you &quot;see stars&quot; following a punch to your head. Your visual centres get input and normally they only know light, so they &quot;create&quot; light, in your vision.</p>
<p>TL;DR: it is unknown what causes migraines and aura's, but is mostly has something to do with a disbalance in the brain</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several hypotheses about it -- things like altered levels of glutamate or other neurotransmitters in the brain creating localized seizure-like symptoms, for example. As far as I've ever found when poking around the clinical literature (out of curiosity, since I have had migraines with aura since I was fairly young), there is still no <em>definite, isolated</em> cause.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
