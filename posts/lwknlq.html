		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s primarily driven by genetics, but there are a few other things that factor in. If you have things in your ears a lot (cotton swabs, keys, pen caps, fingers) it can stimulate your ears to produce more. If you over wash that can strip out the wax (and your natural protective layer of skin oils) and stimulate more production as well. Diet can, in individual circumstances, also play a role though not usually to a huge extent.</p>
<p>TLDR: It’s pretty much a gene driven process, but keep crap out of your ears.</p>
<p>Edit: Someone else replied further down about hormonal changes - I definitely forgot about that. The human body is fascinating!</p>
<p>Edit 2: Ya’ll are blowing up my inbox XD - yes, ear buds and ear plugs can (but don’t necessarily) stimulate more wax production. If you’re constantly putting something into and pulling it out of your ear, then even if it’s designed to fit there (ear plugs/buds) it’s going to create some irritation and possibly increase the ear wax. Occasional use of something like that likely won’t lead to a bunch of overproduction of wax. It’s also true that loud sounds may cause some people’s ears to produce more wax - but if that’s the case you should be WAAAAY more worried about damage to your hearing than some extra ear goo!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the main genetic controls of earwax type is the ABCC11 gene. This is a membrane transport gene involved in aprocrine and tissue secretions. The gene has simple dominant Mendelian inheritance. So three of the alleles (gene variants); GG, Ga and aG encode wet earwax and one variant, aa, encodes dry flaky earwax. Only about 2% of the world has the aa combination and those are concentrated in East Asia. Interestingly if you have wet ear wax your ABCC11 gene/protein also exports larger amounts of aprocrine secretions from your skin which makes your underarm sweat much more pungent.</p>
<p>There are likely other genetic controls of earwax type and production but this the one that has been best studied.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although not directly responsible for the production of earwax, allergies and infections significantly impact the sensation of ear fullness and the amount of wax and fluid in the inner ear (which you can't reach with q-tips!), which is often mistaken as overproduction of ear wax. Histamines cause the eustachian tubes to swell, making it difficult for the inner ear to drain properly and causing a sensation of fullness in the ear. They also cause the skin in the outer ear to swell and itch, and become more sensitive to wax there. This often causes people to try to clean the ear with q-tips or other objects, but you can't reach the part of the ear causing sensations of fullness, and irritating the itchy skin of the ear canal only makes the problem worse. Decongestants are the best solution for the sensation of ear fullness (relieving congestion in the sinuses allows the eustachian tubes to open an drain the inner ear) and anti histamines are the best solution for itching and swelling in the ear canal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
