<p>The flies are just trying to fly towards the light source they see. Whether or not they are capable of seeing the glass as different from air, they don't understand the concept of having an object they can see through but cannot fly through. To the insect, if they see the light then they just fly towards it. They are incapable of understanding that they cannot fly through glass. Therefore they won't &quot;know&quot; too look for an open window. They just keep trying until they accidentally hit the opening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Houseflies (and most other insects) have rather specialized eyes adapted to navigate in flight. A fly primarily sees what's known as &quot;optical flow&quot;, i.e its movement relative to stuff around it, which it uses to navigate. It's not adapted to handle transparent barriers like glass (because such barriers just don't exist in a fly's natural environment).</p>
<p>Most animals have significantly worse eyesight than humans - when it comes to generalized daytime vision, humans are among the best, only a few birds of prey have better eyesight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;Flies get into houses because they are searching for food. Flies find food by smell. Smell diffuses through air. So imagine a fly trying to get into your house. If it comes to a closed window, it can't smell food through the window so it ignores it. If there's an open crack at the bottom of the window or an open door or something, it can smell the food and will follow the scent through the opening, which will actually let it get inside, because usually where the smell is going out there is an actual passage for the fly going in. The exception here is screen doors and windows, and sometimes you will see flies buzzing all around those trying to get inside and failing, because they can't follow the smell.<br />
Flies bump into glass windows but can't escape because flies, when not following a scent towards food, are attracted to light. Flies aren't very smart, so they usually just home in on the brightest light source. Inside a house, the light source is usually the window. The fly doesn't really understand glass, so it keeps banging against it trying to fly toward the light. It's not smart enough to realize it isn't making progress and search around for another way out.<br />
To sum up: Flies following the light to leave a house tend to run into an impassible barrier (glass) while flies following smells to get into a house tend to find actual openings (open cracks, open doors). So they get in more easily than they get out.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
