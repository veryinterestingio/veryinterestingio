<p>Think of a rock mountain actually more like a sponge. A sponge seems like it fills with water perfectly evenly, but when you zoom in if you were to fill a sponge certain holes would fill faster than other ones. There are little pockets of water in the side of the mountains. Sometimes the entire mountain is full of water, but oftentimes there's just a little pocket where it collects before pressure or gravity causes it to flow down to the next little pocket. A spring is just tapping into one of those pockets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, water above ground tends to pool into ponds and lakes that are basically flat on the top. But water below ground (called an aquifer) is not like a lake. It's usually moving according to specific patterns. </p>
<p>One of those patterns is that the water on a hill tends to follow the shape of the surface. Kind of <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/TA4qHBC8iBXjbHWo8" target="_blank">like this</a> (disregarding the interpolation lines). Sometimes a large rainfall can cause the aquifer to fill up and the top of the aquifer (the water table) will meet the surface of the hill and you get a spring! </p>
<p>However, most hills aren't just lumps of one material. So you can get interesting things like <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/LhX78Xxh2Z4D63PN7" target="_blank">a perched water table </a>. Which can lead to a spring. </p>
<p>One rule that water always follows, it that it prefers the path of least resistance. So if there is a channel that's easier to follow, it might even flow uphill! Like <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/8tEu698FoucUGXi37" target="_blank">in this image</a>, the water is filtering down into the rock (in this case granite) but suddenly there is a fault which causes there to be something like a pipe. All the pressure from the water being under the rock causes it to go spurting up through the crack. In the example image, the water went so deep and came up so fast it's a hotspring! (But not a geyser, you need different conditions for geysers). If it came up more slowly, the heat would be lost and it would be a regular spring. </p>
<p>I apologize if this is closer to ELI15. But it's a very complex subject. I suppose the ELI5 would be &quot;when it rains, there's lots of water and it comes out at the surface&quot;. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Springs are the result of the water table rising above the land surface. This can happen as aquifers fill over hundreds or thousands of years.</p>
<p>These aquifers typically form in cavities, or large holes, in the bedrock. These cavities are likely to exist/form in local depressions in the landscape. Therefore, they can form at higher elevations if the area is lower in elevation than the surrounding area.</p>
<p>Edit: My apologies. A few people pointed out the second paragraph is misleading. I described an artesian aquifer, while aquifers come in many shapes and forms. Regardless, the point is that a spring is formed when water stored in aquifers underground flow onto the Earthâ€™s surface.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In hydrology there's two terms we're interested in here. Water Table, and Potentiometric Surface.</p>
<p>The water table is simply the depth that the top of the water sits at (e.g. 10m below surface). Groundwater is under pressure, sorta like if you filled a baggie with water and then put a bunch of books on top. The weight of all the rock and stuff above it pressurizes the water. The Potentiometric Surface is the height that the water would rise <em>if that pressure was removed in an area</em>, like if you poked a pinhole in your baggie of water while the books are on top, it would spray upward.</p>
<p>An Artesian spring, which is what you're describing, is simply a place where the Potentiometric Surface is <strong>above</strong> the ground surface. So when there's a weak spot like a well, or cracks in the Earth, the water bubbles up out of the ground until gravity and other forces pull it back down.</p>
<p>Another thing that can happen is when water seems to flow out the side of a hill. What's going on here is that under the water table beneath that hill there's a layer of impenetrable material that water can't pass through easily called a 'confining layer', or aquitard. The water can't go down anymore, so it goes off to the side, going downhill. When it hits the side of the hill, it still can't go down because of that aquitard, so it just dribbles out the side of the hill. You can see this if you look at a hillside and part way up there's suddenly a bunch of greenery with nothing above it. The plants took root there because there's lots of water percolating through the soil there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If there's enough land higher than the spring, rain soaking the ground can come out well up a hill.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you get get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artesian_aquifer" target="_blank">Artesian Aquifers</a> while are pressurized from higher land, possibly some distance away. A well or passage into the aquifer can yield water, even at the top of a hill.</p>
<p>More commonly, this is an illusion - if you're at the bottom of a steep slope, observing a water coming down the slope from apparently the top, you may be completely unaware that there's a large, less steeply sloped upland area behind it, which collects water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
