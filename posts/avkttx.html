		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in Neonatal ICU and we have had a fair share of addicted infants. A couple of signs are an inconsolable cry and poor eating. If the mom admits she used we may be able to get a poop and urine sample. Since the baby’s 1st poop (meconium) has been collecting for months we can tell if mom used earlier in pregnancy. If mom doesn’t fess up there are some telltale symptoms. They can be either frantic when eating or uninterested. Some of them arch their backs so hard they can’t even be swaddled. Some will shake, tremor, have stomach pains, liquid poops that give them a horrible butt rash, some run fevers, move around so much they excoriate their skin. Usually it is a mix of several of the symptoms. They can’t sleep. They are truly suffering and have no filter. We carry and hold them a lot. Sometimes they need a feeding tube. To help with their symptoms they may get morphine or methadone. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Crack baby here. My adoptive mom told me that I never stopped crying for the first 3 months. I also had tremors where I'd shake uncontrollably randomly. Doctor's told my mom I'd never be able to go to a normal school because of it. Lots of stigmas back then. I'm a perfectly normal 24 year old with a bachelor's degree.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some drugs are able to cross the placenta and enter the fetus.   Exposure to a drug over time, followed by an abrupt cessation of the drug intake (as would happen when the umbilical cord is no longer functioning) can induce symptoms of withdrawal in humans including newborn infants.  </p>
<p>Now infants can't tell you exactly what they are feeling, but blood toxicology screening of the parent (or just the parent admitting) and a few physical symptoms can usually tell a lot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Me and all 7 of my siblings come from a heroin/crack/ meth user.  We all had the shakes and seizures when we were born.  A multitude of other withdrawl symptoms correlating to drug use. 7 different siblings, 7 different fathers. Crazy life. She is at Chino Womens Prison for the next 20 years as of last year. Crazy life.</p>
<p>Edit just to say that social workers are over worked, underpaid and emotionally destroyed within a few years.</p>
<p>Edit 2. There is a lady in this world who has taken in hundreds of kids. And im not exaggerating. Last time i went to go speak with her she estimated that she had taken in and nurtured about 300 kids in her stint as a short term and long term foster mother. Her husband deserves as much credit as well. They are in their 90s now but they have never received any recognition and they have never asked for it. But if there are such things as angels, that is what they are. I will upload a happy picture of me and 11 of my foster brothers and sisters all sitting in high chairs while they cooked in the background. It will make you guys smile.</p>
<p>Edit: Dam, you guys are really serious about this AMA...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
