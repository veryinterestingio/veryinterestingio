<p>A microphone picks up the direct signal from your mouth -&gt; microphone, but generally does a poor job picking up the reflections from the room. So you often end up with a very &quot;dry&quot; sounding signal. It has no reverberation, and you don't hear your body vibrating when you talk like you would normally. That's why your voice sounds so different when you hear it from a microphone.</p>
<p>When you hear an echo, you're hearing no direct signal, and no vibrations from within your body. You're hearing only the reflected signal, which is filtered by the environment.</p>
<p>A microphone : </p>
<ul>
<li>picks up the direct signal </li>
<li>picks up 0 vibrations from within your body </li>
<li>picks up very little reflections from the room </li>
</ul>
<p>An echo : </p>
<ul>
<li>no direct signal whatsoever </li>
<li>0 vibrations from within your body </li>
<li>everything you hear is reflected signal </li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, the vast majority of recordings you're hearing are treated in a variety of ways. They often do noise-reduction, will often process the volume so that it's more smooth and constant throughout (think of recordings where someone pronouncing the letter p explodes your microphone), and generally easier to hear/understand.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Older answer:</p>
<p>When you’re speaking directly into a microphone, the microphone is picking up almost exclusively the direct sound from your mouth, and not the reflections within the room.</p>
<p>So when you listen to a recording of your voice, you’re listening to only the “dry” signal (direct soundwaves) and not any “wet” signal (reflections off the ground, your shoulders, the walls of the room). It sounds unnatural because in almost all real-world environments you hear reflections along with your voice.</p>
<p>When you listen to an echo of your voice, you’re hearing the wet signal. It’s just delayed because of significant distance. But it’s reverberation, which is often lacking in raw recordings, or artificial sounding when added after the fact. But you're not hearing any direct signal whatsoever, and no internal vibrations within your body whatsoever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
