		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm notorious for choosing the wrong words to describe some situation or feeling. Actually I'm pretty bad at describing things in general and I can't be the only person. So why is it entirely up to me to know the meds 'are working' and it not being investigated or substantiated by a brain scan or a test.. just something more scientific?? Because I have depression and anxiety.. I don't know what a person w/o depression feels like or what's the 'normal' amount of 'sad'! And pretty much everything is going to have some effect.</p>
<p>Edit, 2 days later: I'm amazed how much this has blown up. Thank you for the silver. Thank you for the gold. Thank you so much for all of your responses. They've been thoughtful and educational :)</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There has been tremendous interest among psychiatrists in coming up with objective tests for mental illness. There is a large group of researchers as part of the <a href="http://enigma.ini.usc.edu/" target="_blank">ENIGMA</a> study to try to tease this out. The issue is that there is tremendous variation between normal people so abnormalities are not specific to people with mental illness. Additionally, similar to pain, mental illness is literally &quot;all in your head.&quot; You can't objectively measure pain, sadness, and suicidal ideation with the techniques we have right now; I doubt we ever well. For example, what is an acceptable level of apathy? That may differ tremendously between people based on their jobs, family lives, culture, and general life views. That's why we have psychiatrists, to tease these issues out and adjust the plan appropriately. A good psychiatrist is really listening to what you say, how you look, etc to really gain a sense of how you're doing and where she wants you to go with your illness. She's not just sitting there and randomly throwing out meds.</p>
<p>Right now, the field of neuropsychiatry is in its infancy, trying to understand changes in the brain to better map out the pathways involved. If we understand the pathways, we could maybe treat better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the criteria for something to be classified as a mental disorder is that the issue must cause significant distress to the individual or those around them. Often times the best way to determine if this criteria has been met is to take into account the patients' subjective experience of the phenomenon, as they're the ones experiencing the fallout of the disorder (or lack thereof).
