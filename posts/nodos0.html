		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>“Mastering” usually means taking a whole song that’s been recorded and making the final track sound the best it possibly can. Remastering is doing that again for a song that’s already come out before. Sometimes modern equipment can help us make a song sound better in ways that old technology wasn’t able to, or sometimes we change things just because more people like a different type of sound now than they used to.</p>
<p>When a song is remastered, it might be made louder, made to have more bass or treble so that different parts of the song stand out more, and compressed to make the difference between the loudest and quietest parts of the song smaller, so that it sounds smoother or more “glued together.” Some people like the remastered versions of songs best because they sound more like something that might be produced today, and some people prefer the older versions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Remastering a track is taking the original mix done by the mix engineer and doing a new &quot;master,&quot; on it. The point of a master is to get the best quality version of a song for current playback equipment. So when you see say the version of Dark Side of the Moon that was remastered in 2011 the original stereo mix downs have not been changed, but rather the &quot;master copy,&quot; has been improved to sound better on more modern audio systems like your phone and soundbar. In 1973 the master of Dark Side would sound different than the 2011 remaster because the 1973 master was intended for vinyl and tape playback rather than digital streaming.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sound engineer and it doesn’t seem like any answer so far is a true ELI5 so here’s my take:</p>
<p>Mixing a song is making sure all the instruments in that song blend together perfectly. Say you have 8 instruments, you’re mixing them together like ingredients to make a cake batter. </p>
<p>You then send that cake batter to a person who has a really expensive oven and a baker who knows how to use that oven to turn that batter in to the best cake possible.</p>
<p>As time goes on, better and better ovens and better and better bakers who know how to use these fancy ovens pop up due to technology, and better understanding of how the technology works. So though we still have the original recipe for the batter, you can stand to make a remastered version of the cake to sell to people. </p>
<p>Typically the mastering engineer doesn’t have the individual ingredients to the cake batter, just the already mixed batter to work with. But they have some super fancy equipment, tons of experience, and an excellent ear/palette to know how to turn that batter in to a better cake than the original.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>David Bowie tried his hardest to clean it up but it was a shit recording to begin with. Some people prefer the iggy mix because it sounds a little more raw and punk rock.  </p>
