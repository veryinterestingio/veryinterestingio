		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is because of so called &quot;Mie scattering&quot; of sun light in the haze, contained in lowest layers of athmosphere.
The light passing through the haze changes its direction to random other directions. So, it catches light from sun and directs some of it towards your eyes.</p>
<p>When you look up, the layer of the haze is pretty thin and does not significally affect color of the sky.
But when you look to horizon your look goes through about 5 km full of the haze, and your eye catches all that scattered light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it's a bit of statistics, mixed with physics. The scattering effects described by others aren't wrong, they just aren't describing the whole picture of the question i believe you are asking. Two things in particular will contribute to the sky appearing lighter during sunset; the first being the contrast ratio between the sky and the ground being higher since the light rays are being projected onto a near-parallel surface causing the luminosity of the ground to drop; and the second being that a larger proprtion of the sun's light is now being absorbed into the atmosphere via scattering affects. When the sun is directly overhead, each square mile of atmosphere only has a distance as thick as the atmosphere's height for it to absorb and scatter the sun's light, meaning that the distance is relatively small to the distance it will travel through the atmosphere at sunset. During sunset, the sun's light is coming through the atmosphere at a low angle, which causes the light to effectively travel through even more miles of atmosphere than when shining straight down, allowing the atmosphere to absorb and scatter an even larger portion of the sun's light, making the sky appear brighter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the sun is directly above you, there's of course the atmosphere above you, and there's just enough air that it scatters the light and turns it blue.</p>
<p>When the sun is closer to the horizon, there's a lot more air to get through. Because of Raleigh (I think I spelled it right) scattering, instead of a blue color, we get a more pronounced colour.</p>
<p>However, that is not all, With something called Mie scattering, which happens in the troposphere, the light takes on a pinkish and red pastel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
