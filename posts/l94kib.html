		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We CAN.</p>
<p>Now, it's not very often in nature you come across pure hydrogen and pure oxygen.  But if you do have pure hydrogen and pure oxygen and you put them together in the right ratio, it's very easy to get them to form water.  In fact, it's hard to PREVENT them from forming water.</p>
<p>It's a common 9th grade science experiment, you run electricity through water in a certain way and one electrode has bubbles of pure oxygen forming on it and the other pure hydrogen.  You catch each in their own test-tube. You combine the two.   A very small spark will cause them to smoosh together and form water.  Thing is, sometimes you don't even need a spark, sometimes just the right (or wrong) type of shaking will do the trick.</p>
<p>Now, in the process of forming water a lot of heat is generated, which has the potential to be very damaging.</p>
<p>Also, pure oxygen tends to burn super easy so there's not a lot of pure oxygen around.  And pure hydrogen tends to react with stuff a lot too.  So you don't bump into pure forms of them very often in nature.  And making pure forms of them is relatively difficult and expensive.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We totally can by burning hydrogen. Burning is the process of combining a chemical with oxygen and releasing heat at the same time. The reason why it burns is because two hydrogen and one oxygen molecule contain more internal energy than a single water molecule, so that energy goes away in the form of heat and light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We do make water like that, as a number of other commenters have said. In fact, there's a very specific application where we want to make water exactly like that: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_rocket_propellant#Hydrogen" target="_blank">in a rocket engine</a>. Because the act of combining oxygen and hydrogen to make water is very energetic and releases a lot of heat, and because water is actually quite a light molecule and all that heat makes it easy to accelerate it, rocket engines using hydrogen and oxygen are amongst the most efficient. The most well-known examples of a 'hydrolox' engine are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-25" target="_blank">Space Shuttle main engines</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
