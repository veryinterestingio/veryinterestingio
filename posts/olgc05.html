		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Parasites generally don't come into your system as full-grown organisms. What happens is that you consume either their eggs or cysticerci (cysticerci are sort of like eggs, but are found in the muscle of pigs or cattle in the form of cysts).  Both of these are resistant to digestion; both acidic and enzymatic. Once the eggs or cysticerci pass through your stomach and end up in a more favorable environment in the small intestine they will hatch and grow into proper parasitic organisms like tapeworms, roundworms, pinworms, etc. I encourage you to google images of human parasite lifecycles to get a nice general idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>They have protective layers. Bacteria with protective layers can survive stomach acid too (helicobacter pylori, causes stomach ulcers). Protective layers everywhere.</p>
<p>That's why it's also important to chew plants - they have a protective coating on the outside, so you need to mush them with your teeth to mechanically destroy (or cause holes in) the protective layer to let the acid dissolve it further.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just as your stomach doesn't digest itself, a tapeworm egg or other bug may have a protective coating of some kind that allows it to survive its time in the stomach until it makes it to your intestine.  </p>
<p>It can't survive indefinitely in your stomach, but if it is only there for a short time, it will make it through.  </p>
<p>Other bugs are totally happy in your stomach.  Your stomach is actually full of bacteria (generally 'good' bacteria).  So there are some that are just able to produce lots of substances that help it survive in the acidic environment.  </p>
<p>Life, uh, finds a way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thing is - you’re eating stomach bugs and germs constantly, but the vast majority of them do get digested.  It’s only certain things that resist it well enough to be a problem.  For example, h. pylori is a bacteria that likes to infect your stomach and cause ulcers, and has ways of modifying the inside of your stomach to suit it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just as an aside OP, insulin isn't digested. It has been super hard for them to make a non-injection form of it, and as far as I know, they had to make it an inhaler (I think). You have to inject it into fatty tissue and that lets you absorb it slow enough to safely use. Eating it would destroy it, as far as I know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
