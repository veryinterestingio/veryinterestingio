		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the major points regarding refeeding syndrome and hyponatremia have already been covered in this thread. So I'd like to point out a different issue with severe dehydration. As the body becomes increasingly dehydrated, it becomes increasingly difficult to actually get water in. </p>
<p>This is especially true when you consider one of the most common causes of dehydration is fluid loss due to GI illness. (vomiting and diarrhea). This is even doubly so with infants. It's not possible to rehydrate simply by drinking. You cause more vomiting, more loss, and risk aspirating and drowning. And with dehydration comes hypovolemia. There's so little volume of blood in your veins that they are virtually impossible to start an IV without blowing the vessel. </p>
<p>The most extreme treatment for this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraosseous_infusion" target="_blank">Intraosseous Infusion</a> , where fluids are injected directly into the bone marrow. In laymen terms, we jam a straw into your shin and pour saline/meds/etc.</p>
<p>There isn't really a point of no return on life, so long as you're still alive. But that's not to say you won't have lasting ill effects. Lifelong dialysis due to kidney failure is a bitch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
