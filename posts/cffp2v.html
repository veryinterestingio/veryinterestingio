		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;core&quot; never really fuses gold, as the core is only ever capable of fusing up to iron, and only the heaviest stars will ever get to that point. Smaller stars like our sun can only provide enough temperature and pressure through gravity to fuse up to oxygen and carbon, and then die out as white dwarfs. As gold is significantly heavier than iron, a star's core can never produce it while it's still &quot;alive.&quot;  </p>
<p>Iron is the point at which further fusion reactions require you to add energy rather than the reaction producing any. That's the point at which the core suddenly collapses and begins the supernova, because the iron is not producing energy pressure to hold up the weight of the rest of the star anymore.  </p>
<p>As the core collapses, unless it's so heavy that it collapses straight into a black hole, it stops and &quot;bounces&quot; at the point it creates a neutron star, which can hold itself up through other methods than fusion. The rebound shock wave  briefly produces energies and pressures even higher than the fusion core of the original star. This brief period is capable of fusing the rest of the elements heavier than iron on the periodic table.  </p>
<p>However it's funny you ask about gold, because up until now, we didn't think this brief period during a supernova was sufficient to create the amount of gold we actually see in the universe. Very recently, we observed two neutron stars orbiting and colliding into each other. This seems to create enough temperature and pressure for long enough to explain the rest of the gold out there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's actually a pretty even mix. Elements heavier than iron are made by atoms capturing neutrons, which can occur in one of two ways, imaginatively called rapid and slow neutron capture (or r and s).</p>
<p>Rapid capture occurs where there are enough neutrons that atoms can be built up faster than they decay. This in turn requires hundreds of neutron captures per second, needing insane free neutron densities that you'll only find in a supernova or neutron star collision. For elements with non-contiguous stable isotopes, rapid capture tends to be the only way the heavier isotopes can be formed.</p>
<p>Then there's the slow path, where an atom will capture a neutron, decay, capture a new one, etc. This requires a star with high metallicity, i.e. where part of it is made up from the remnants of a supernova so that there is iron present in the core while it is undergoing fusion. Here it's more like one neutron capture per hundreds of years. Generally happens in the cores of giant stars</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's mostly the first thing, as the star runs out of fuel it can't fight against gravity anymore which creates the pressures neccesary to make heavier elements.</p>
<p>However, as the blast happens the star looks a lot like an onion, with iron on the inside surrounded by shells of progressively lighter elements. As the shockwave from the blast propogates outwards, you do get some elements heavier than iron created in that front.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
