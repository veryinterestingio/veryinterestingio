		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The real answer here is better nutrition. There hasn’t been enough time for it to be an evolutionary thing. People just used to have much more sporadic access to food, and often of lower quality which stunted their growth.</p>
<p>Food is now plentiful and easily accessible in much of the world, so people are more likely to reach or get close to their maximum potential height than was the case in the past.</p>
<p>In any timescale of hundreds or even thousands of years, you aren’t likely to see people get a lot taller than the tallest populations that you find today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not because of mutations, but nutrition as has been pointed out here.</p>
<p>If you want to see how tall a human can get without a mutation, look at the ex-basketball player [Shawn Bradley](<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn</a> Bradley). I read a paper where a geneticist ask Bradley if he'd mind giving a sample for DNA testing. Shawn agreed.</p>
<p>Turns out that Shawn Bradley does not have any mutations. He just happens to have <em>all</em> the normal versions of about 100+ genes that contribute to increased height in a human. He's likely very maximum that is possible without a mutation for a human. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nutrition is the primary factor. You can see this in photos of soldiers at the border between North and South Korea. They are of the same genetic &quot;stock&quot; so to speak but North Korea has had many famines and even now does not have great nutrition and so the people their are much shorter than their neighbors who have had plenty of food. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If an animal is twice as tall, twice as wide, and twice as long it will weigh 8 times as much but will only be 4 times as strong because strength is determined by a muscle's cross sectional area.  The muscle's length does not add to strength.  That's why elephants and rhinos have those tree trunk legs.  So strength will be a problem when humans get too big.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also something to consider is that the poor health and nutrition of North Koreans has caused them to shrink in average size as compared to their South Korean counterparts. Remember that just 70 years ago, this was one country.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
