		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is, there just isn't enough DNA.</p>
<p>Sure, theoretically we could make something work with recently extinct animals (as well as some as far back as the ice age), the problem is we couldn't necessarily create a breeding population. Anything found in fossils is far too fragmented, and the stuff in amber in biting insects, it's near impossible to separate the various strands into coherent DNA profiles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s not that you can’t it’s just very difficult. Here are some of the challenges:</p>
<p>1) all cells contain enzymes like DNase and RNAse which immediately begins destroying the DNA of cells that have died. Degraded DNA must be reconstructed meticulously in order to produce clones. This is very difficult using modern technology for very long fragments of DNA like a genome. (Relatively Easy to reconstruct the genome digitally but very difficult to synthesize DNA the size of a genome.)</p>
<p>2) a viable cell line would need to be produced from the genetic material. This is the most difficult part and will likely take pure chance to occur.</p>
<p>3) cell line would need to be cultured in an an artificial womb bag filled with nutrients and supplied with oxygen and glucose. </p>
<p>This would all take a great deal of work but theoretically it is possible. The question about why it hasn’t been done yet is because there has been no pressing need to have the mammoths or the dodos return.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's maybe possible to clone a mammoth or a dodo, maybe even possible to create enough of them to become a stable population. But independent of whether we can do that... what would happen?</p>
<p>Would a new population of mammoths survive in an arctic that's warmer than the ice age and getting warmer really fucking fast? Would a new flock of dodos survive on a Mauritius that still has the human activity and invasive species that drove it to extinction in the first place?</p>
<p>Lots of scientists and wildlife conservationists would also say that the huge cost of trying to bring back an extinct species would be better spent trying to save a hundred that are still around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
