		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's kind of a weird idea but our brain loves habit loops and fulfilling these habit loops. So like even though it's literally killing someone to smoke. Because they have this habit when they do it, the brain likes it. So, especially when you're young, embarrassment can be good. By messing up a word and getting called out for it, this embarrasses me and I will think about this embarrassing moment over and over and I will never forget how to say this word. But now as an adult I don't need to relive my most embarrassing moments. I have learned from these moments already. But my brain is so used to this negative highlight reel that it plays it anyway. </p>
<p>So to break from this you need to actively fight it. You need to realize what is the cue-response- and reward. Many times late at night before you go to be, your brain just wants stimulus so it activates this highlight reel. So maybe instead you read a book. If you change the response and your brain gets the same reward of being stimulated before going to bed then everyone wins. Or doing 3 push ups. Or saying out loud, I am great, or I got this. But you need to for a new response to the cue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an evolutionary survival mechanism. Seeing possible threats (negative stuff) and creating possibilities from known objects (weird stuff) creates an attention association, lowering the possibility of surprise and death. Not incredibly useful in modern cognitive society granted, but there are a lot of left over evolutionary fragments in humans!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dont know how to ELI5, but as someone who used to have this really bad, and now i dont have it at all anymore i can tell you its related to the feelings you carry in your body.</p>
<p>If you carry guilt, shame and anger in your body, related thoughts will arise. After you deal with your shit no negative thoughts arise at all anymore.</p>
<p>I used to think &quot;im worthless&quot;, ok this is guilt and shame. So i focus on the feeling, not the thought. Can i accept this guilt and shame, even if it never goes away? Sure. Then it starts to fade, and by this point i cant even remember what the intrusive thought was anymore.</p>
<p>Doing this changed my life completely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It can be a sign of anxiety, if you find your brain is taking over and spirals around bad memories constantly you may need to learn to reprogram your brain to let go of things a bit easier. The above suggestions are good - try to distract yourself, read, music in the back ground etc </p>
<p>Mindfulness can help a lot with this too - try to acknowledge the thought ('man, I really made an idiot of myself that time') and just let it pass ('yep, I sure did.'), rather than poking at the bad memory ('that was so embarrassing, I hate myself, I always screw things up').
If I'm alone when I get 'the horrors', I actually vocalise these thoughts, it makes it easier to dismiss.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Negative things are more thought-provoking and interesting. Your mind could generate endless possibilities of bad situations you can get into. Besides being a survival instinct, this creates anxiety and adrenaline.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
