	<title>ELI5: Why do “streaks” feel so important for quitting vices/addictions or achieving goals? For example, why does it feel like a bigger achievement to say “I haven’t had any fast food for an entire year”, than “I’ve limited the amount of fast food I’ve had in general”.</title>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because of the human condition, it's easier to self control when there's nothing to control.</p>
<p>A little bit of something bad means now you have to control it in focus.</p>
<p>A whole lot of nothing means you only have to control avoiding that thing. You don't have to control the amount you take, not how often, not when, not why, and not where.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because “I’ve had no fast food in a year” means, no fast food in a year. </p>
<p>“I’ve limited the amount of fast food I’ve had” means anywhere between 0-99% of the normal amount of fast food, and for an undefined period of time. It doesn’t say anything about how much you’ve actually restricted yourself, and doesn’t indicate anything about how successful you’ve been. </p>
<p>The longer you go, the more situations you are going to run into where you might be tempted to do something again, “Just this once.” Quitting things can be hard. I can say I haven’t had any fast food since yesterday, but that doesn’t mean anything, if I go and have fast food later today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It creates value in it's size.  Think about a rubber band ball.  One rubber band has no value - you wouldnt really care if you lost it.  10, OK, you're getting somewhere, 100, neat, 1000 - you'd be sad if something happened to it.  The more you've added to the total, the more you want to keep the progress going and the more important it is to you. That makes it easier for you to avoid the temptation because you know just how much you'll loose by slipping.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we accomplish something we perceive to be difficult, our brain releases &quot;feel good&quot; chemicals. A streak is a reminder of progress, which feels good.</p>
<p>And, people usually praise specific accomplishments. Praise also makes us feel good. &quot;I lost 30 lbs&quot; usually gets a better reaction than &quot;I lost some weight.&quot; So our brains are conditioned to like specific outcomes, which reinforces the power of streaks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
