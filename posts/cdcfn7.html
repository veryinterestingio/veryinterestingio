		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's true that birds don't have lips, but they also don't have vocal cords, flexible tongues, or teeth, which in some ways makes it even more incredible that some species can mimic us so well!  Birds use a structure called a <a href="http://wysinfo.com/wyswp/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Wysinfo-Bird-Syrinx_400.jpg" target="_blank">syrinx</a> to produce almost all sounds, which is located <a href="https://academy.allaboutbirds.org/wp-content/uploads/ARTICLE-SONG-1440X8002-764x424.png" target="_blank">much further down</a> their trachea than our larynx.  And unlike our <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/-/media/kcms/gbs/patient-consumer/images/2013/11/15/17/42/ds00670_-ds00366_im02764_r7_openclosethu_jpg.jpg" target="_blank">vocal cords</a> which open and close, the syrinx uses a system of rings to compress the trachea in different locations.  Songbirds can actually use both sides of the syrinx semi-independently to produce more complicated sounds, as <a href="https://academy.allaboutbirds.org/features/birdsong/how-birds-sing" target="_blank">this cool interactive demo</a> shows.</p>
<p>While this system does allow some sounds to be produced in the same ways as they are in humans, other sounds must be mimicked with fundamentally different mechanisms.  For example, <a href="https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v113n01/p0041-p0058.pdf" target="_blank">Warren et al. 1996</a> discuss some of the similarities and differences between vowel production in humans and parrots, such as modulation of the length of the trachea (which humans can't do).  Other studies like <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982204006190#BIB3" target="_blank">Beckers et al. 2004</a> have demonstrated that tongue placement can be used to change sound quality, despite the fact that parrot tongues are <a href="https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--wmJbPrLs--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/188mqcyblcbc0jpg.jpg" target="_blank">very different from ours</a> and contain bones.  I couldn't find anything that specifically addresses &quot;f&quot; sounds, but <a href="https://asa.scitation.org/doi/10.1121/1.421365" target="_blank">Patterson and Pepperberg 1998</a> discusses stop consonants in parrots (including &quot;b&quot; and &quot;p&quot;).  Frustratingly though, I was unable to access the full text of this article even through my university's system, so I can't go into details; maybe someone else will be able to describe that paper more.</p>
<p>Edit: I was able to track down a <a href="https://booksc.xyz/ireader/34406620" target="_blank">full version of that paper</a> thanks to some help from u/sorhead.  It contains a lot more linguistics than biology and so is somewhat over my head, but suffice it to say there are indeed differences in how parrots pronounce some of these sounds compared to humans, and certain sounds are noticeably less consistent and also not quite as intelligible as others.  To quote one section that summarizes nicely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[The parrot's] /b/ was somewhat of an outlier, and /p/ clustered nearer /d,g/ than /k,t/. Such findings are not surprising given that Alex [the parrot] produces /b,p/ without lips or teeth; he may compensate by using specific glottal and esophageal mechanisms unavailable to humans.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've seen this question answered before. If I'm remembering correctly, what they said was that a bird's vocal cords themselves are much more versatile than ours and act more like a speaker. While our vocal cords can only make one tone at a time, theirs can make several, and, since all sounds can be made by combining tones, they're able to make any sound using only their vocal cords. If none of that really made sense, just know that birds basically have biological speakers in their throats and can make just about any sound they want.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
