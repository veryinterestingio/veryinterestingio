		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I’m guessing you’re picturing something along the lines of Hawaii, which has fertile soil that’s great for farming. In that case the magma/lava forming the island is generally basaltic and rich in a number of nutrients (e.g. iron, phosphorus, etc.). This type of rock can form a quite fertile soil once adequately weathered. </p>
<p>Also, “volcanic glass” in the case of a basalt refers more to the structure of the rock (mineral grain size) rather than composition, so basaltic glass can still have plenty of iron, etc. in it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: microbes. </p>
<p>Microbes such as bacteria, fungi, protozoa, nematodes, earthworms, and arthropods all contribute to break down the minerals in rocks and are easily carried across the seas by winds and animals (like birds). With help from regular atmospheric chemical reactions, these microbes will turn the hard rock into fertile soil. But not all plants don’t need layers of soil to grow, just access to a secure spot with water will allow plants to help break down rocks as well. A good example would be a weed growing in between two pieces of concrete on a sidewalk.
As for how the plants get there, it’s the same way as the microbes. Winds can carry seeds a long way and birds will bring seeds and other nutrients in their poop. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Auckland harbour there is a volcano that came up several hundred years ago.  You can visit it and see the process.  Some areas are still churned up lava, and bare, but others have plants, including many examples of a large native tree that grows happily in little crevices in rock.  And the plants allow birds and insects, which allow further colonisation by plants, and so on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am 100% NOT an expert, but this interests me too.
If memory serves, we've only had 2 islands &quot;appear&quot; from volcanic activity in the last 50 years.
I read an article recently about one of the aforementioned islands being blocked off to humans as much as possible so scientists can research how life gets to these remote locations (so news inbound at some point I guess)
Another I saw recently is a similar situation, but already has life and a very select few scientists have been to it. They reasoned it was probably birds' droppings carrying seeds.
Volcanic soil is incredibly fertile, I know that.
Not sure on the glass thing rn though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The build up of an ecosystem from newly created bare rock is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_succession" target="_blank">Primary Succession</a>.</p>
<p>Its starts with lichen algae and fungi which can survive on bare rock and gradually builds soil which leads to smaller plants and then leads to larger plants. Each phase serves as a nursery for the succeeding phase.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
