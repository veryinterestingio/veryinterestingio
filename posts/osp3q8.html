<p>Hi! I'm a quasi-expert on Enigma and the Bombe. I've given talks on how the Bombe works both from a logical/cryptographic POV, and how it works mechanically.  I've written software for simulating both Enigma and the Bombe.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>If it was encoded with an Enigma machine, No.</p>
<p>Without any information whatsoever about the mechanism or type of encryption/encoding happening, you can't just throw compute power at a cypher text to decode it.  It would be too similar to a one-time pad.  i.e. if you gave me any random cypher text, I could come up with a machine that would &quot;decode&quot; it to Lincoln's Gettysburg address, or the Declaration of Independence.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/Zodiac-340-cypher-cracked-by-code-expert-51-years-15794943.php" target="_blank">Obviously there are plenty of primitive, and some complicated, cypher texts that ARE decodable without knowing the details of the cypher. </a></p>

<p>Yes and no....  </p>
<p>Enigma machines were commercially available for almost two decades prior to the war.
Each company/country/army that used Enigma ordered or wired their own wheels to go into them.  (The Nazis added the plug-board mid-1930s.)  The Polish knew all about Enigma, but early on didn't know the wiring for the wheels.  They made very little progress decoding them until a Nazi sold the details to the French, which passed them on to the Polish.  Once they had this information they were able to break the <strong>preamble only</strong>, but that was enough to read the message.  They made this into the polish Bomba (precursor to the British bombe) to break the messages.  After the Nazis got rid of the preamble, they were in the dark again, unable to decrypt any messages.  This was shortly before the invasion of Poland, so they handed over all their findings to the French and English, and fled in the nick of time.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely.   Polish mathematician Marian Rejewski and colleagues made insights into, and eventually decryption of, Enigma, initially using mathematical reasoning.   Rejewski's initial breakthroughs have been called one of the greatest feats of pure mathematical reasoning in the 20th Century. </p>
<p>&quot;In 1929, while studying mathematics at Poznań University, Rejewski attended a secret cryptology course conducted by the Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau (Biuro Szyfrów), which he joined in September 1932. The Bureau had had no success in reading Enigma-enciphered messages and set Rejewski to work on the problem in late 1932; he deduced the machine's secret internal wiring after only a few weeks. Rejewski and his two colleagues then developed successive techniques for the regular decryption of Enigma messages.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Computerphile recently did a video on this exact subject, and they showed it's not as easy to break as you may think. With a known message, it's trivial, but without one, it's actually pretty difficult. You have to use statistical methods to work out if you're getting closer or not, which shows why enigma isn't a good code to be using anymore, even without anyone knowing any part of the text. Even if you're only partially correct, words can start to appear, and the code breaker can generally piece together your message from what fragments came out.</p>
