		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its due to a thing called the &quot;Automated Clearing House&quot;, or ACH.</p>
<p>In ELI5 terms, all the US banks subscribe to a system where they take all orders for moving money between banks, collect them up (starting after 5pm, close of business), and then send them to one central place called the ACH.  These orders are all sorted and re-ordered.</p>
<p>At midnight of every day before a bank business day, those orders are sent to the receiving bank to process.  Some banks are very automated and will post these immediately, some are a little slower and you'll see it show up right before the bank opens for business.</p>
<p>Some banks (and not naming names) are complete assholes and will wait until their check orders clear before posting your ACH deposits.  This is a scam known as &quot;check reordering&quot;, and many banks still do this to generate insufficient funds fees.</p>
<p>The ACH system is relatively ancient, and there has been a lot of talk about ACH 2.0 that works in real time, but so far it hasn't actually happened.  The main reason is that massive amounts of fraud and financial damage, that can normally take days, can be done in seconds.  They haven't found a good way to protect against that to a universal standard.</p>
<p>ACH is a different system than the equally ancient &quot;wire transfer system&quot;, which I see a lot of people here are talking about.  Wire transfers are processed by hand, where as ACH is transmitted on a massive spreadsheet called a NACHA file and is mostly, if not completely, automated.  The time delays built into the system allows for error checking in the event of bad account numbers and such.</p>
<p>Only if the NACHA file throws an error for some reason would there be &quot;human eyes&quot; in the process.  Hand checking a NACHA file is a massive PITA, but necessary sometimes.</p>
<p>With ACH there is also a &quot;trust system&quot;, where the first time you move money it isn't actually transmitted until a dummy amount (0.00 normally) has been proven to make the trip.  This is to catch the massive amount of wrong account number and destinations that normally are input into the system.  This normally takes 3 business days - 2 to make the round test trip, and another to actually send the money.  Its not foolproof though.</p>
<p>(as an aside, I'm the CEO of a &quot;daily pay&quot; payroll company.  We have to explain exactly how this works about 10 times a day every day)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s not completely automated. An actual person has to “approve” or “release” funds. I work for a company that takes automatic deductions from people’s bank accounts on the first of each month but it isn’t as automated as people think. I have to actually log in to our bank account a couple days before and make a few clicks to make that happen each month.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Automated&quot; is relative.  The capacity for automation is not just a matter of &quot;can something be done automatically,&quot; it's also dependent upon the people and systems involved agreeing to accept that automation.  All automation comes with risks, and some groups are INCREDIBLY risk averse, either for pragmatic or regulatory reasons.</p>
<p>The financial sector is one of those INCREDIBLY risk adverse groups.  Because you're dealing with large potential problems, the acceptance of real automation/process improvements is very far behind the curve.  </p>
<p>So even though much of what we're talking about could be automated from a technological point of view, the changes that would be required to do so are often viewed as just too risky, so &quot;we'll keep on doing it the way we've always done.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
