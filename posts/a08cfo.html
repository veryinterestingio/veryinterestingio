		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is adapted from a previous answer on a similar question.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: You would probably want to wear glove since they only work in vacuum but your gloved hand would probably be fine as long as you don't leave it in front of the thruster for more than a few hours.</p>
<hr />
<p>It's pretty hard to imagine what a happen in a plasma thruster plume (the exhaust) because we do not really have any comparable experience in our everyday life.</p>
<p>First what's in the plume? Most plasma thrusters eject &quot;cold&quot; xenon plasma made out of an equal number of ions (+) and electrons (-). You can replace the xenon by other substances <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/e2/e8/89/e2e8895c6eaf668026b75f8205b20d97.jpg" target="_blank">(it makes pretty colors)</a> but xenon is usually the best. The ions are going between 10 and 100 km/s (20,000 to 200,000 mph). And as you said the mass of ion ejected is usually in the order of a few tens of milligrams per seconds at most. The result is a thrust in the order of 1 to a few 100 millinewtons (about 0.01 pound-force).</p>
<p>So now for you questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Is it hot?</strong> The issue with plasma is that you can define all kind of temperature. For example the electrons and the ions can have different temperatures. In most thruster the plasma is &quot;cold&quot;, that means that the ions are at most a couple hundred degrees C. The electrons on the other hand are usually close to 30,000C (a couple of eV) in the plume. However objets in the plume don't heat up that much. We routinely use plastic zip-ties in the lab and they don't get melted. most of the heating isn't actually caused by the plasma but by the heat radiating from the thruster. For a commercial 1kW thruster with a typical efficiency of 50% you still get 500 W radiated away. That's the equivalent of a powerful light heating you up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Is it reactive?</strong> Nope! The nice thing with noble gases like xenon is that they pretty much never react with anything. Other more exotic propellants like mercury, iodine, lithium or SF6 can get pretty nasty. But with the very low concentrations it isn't a problem before several hundreds hours of exposure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Is it radioactive?</strong> Nope! Contrary to fusion plasma here there is nothing done to the atoms nucleus, and the propellant is non-radioactive. Theoretically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon" target="_blank">radon</a> could be an excellent propellant but with a half life of 4 days it's not particularly practical.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>other radiations?</strong> There is quite a lot of UV coming out so you could potentially get a nice welder tan if you have UV transparent windows on your vacuum chamber.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What about those fast ions?</strong>  There is the danger. Even if there isn't a huge density of ions they really go fast, and when they impact something they will often strip a couple of atoms off the surface. This results in erosion of anything that in the way. In early testing, Boeing actually eroded holes right through components that were a bit too close to plume. This also affects the thrusters themselves. Thruster erosion is the main limitation on the lifespan plasma thrusters. This phenomenon is hard to predict so mission designers are a bit reluctant to use electric propulsion. My PhD research is actually on way to limit this erosion and improve lifetime. To give you and idea, ions will pierce through a sheet of aluminium foil in less than 15min. This phenomenon is often used in surface treatment where thin layers of material can be precisely etched. Or inversely material can be removed from a target to deposit it somewhere else (called sputtering)</p>
</li>
<li><strong>What would you feel?</strong> Assuming you could put your hand in the vacuum chamber you would probably feel a very light push like a slow breeze. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTlcYbIrgmQ&amp;feature=share" target="_blank">Here is a video demonstration</a> I made with a couple of sheets of aluminium foil folded and suspended with very thin metal wires. Keep in mind that the Hall thruster in the video is very small (in fact one of the smallest in the world).</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope that was an useful answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Once upon a time I set up a 5kW hall thuster in front of an 1/8&quot; aluminum plate with probe placed behind it.  When it was time to take measurements, the plan was to open a window and let the ions in.  Before I knew it, the aluminum was essentially &quot;burning&quot; in vacuum.  It was really weird.  After I vented the chamber I think the aluminum oxidized and it made a bunch of white alumium oxide crystals.  The only thing that survived was the fiberglass tape insulation.  I guess when you think about it, there was about 3 kW of power blasting the aluminum plate. That's a lot of juice.</p>
<p>Edit: Oh yeah.  Once I left a penny in front of a test setup.  I hoped that it would melt the penny or something cool. It blasted the penny until it was unrecognizable and it snapped in my hard when I picked it up.  These tests were again about 5 kW of power at relatively high voltage.  500-700 V.  So lower speed than an ion engine but a lot more current density.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work on/ design plasma thrusters for a lab near Seattle. One of the odd limiting factors is heat. People tend to think of space as very cold, but without any gasses to carry away heat, you must find a way to radiate waste heat into the vacuum. It becomes a very hard thermal management problem.
The engines are silent (vacuum of space) however in a lab setting, lots of the inductors we used made a very high pitched, high volume ringing noise.
Another interesting note, the engines produce very little thrust. Even large and powerful plasma engines may only produce the thrust equivalent of a few sheets of paper resting on your hand. The trick is that they do so at a very high efficiency. The goal is not to get high thrust, but to accelerate the smallest amount of mass to the highest speed possible. The reason for using xenon (a VERY expensive gas) is that it is one of the heaviest inert gases. By accelerating molecules of xenon to near-relativistic speeds, you maximize the efficiencies of energy density.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>despite what others have said, i suspect putting your hand into the exhaust of an ion engine would be bad for your hand. perhaps not immediately, but the kinetic transfer would impart energy very efficiently into your hand.  </p>
<p>a similar concept is the electrostatic confinement fusion devices known as &quot;farnsworth fusors.&quot; these devices use ionization in an electrostatic field to drive fusion, they are quite simple devices and are often made by high school students. one of the prime limitations to their use in higher power and net positive fusion reactors is that they have an electrode in the center used to accelerate the ions inward. even for the desktop science fair models that electrode has a lifetime measured in minutes to hours. this is because it is being struck by a small percentage of the ions being accelerated, these ions heat the material to a glow almost immediately and cause it to melt down in a short time. this is the power of high velocity ions in a vacuum. you can, quite easily, get them to move fast enough to overcome their electrostatic repulsion and undergo fusion. transerfing that much energy in a kinetic impact is going to heat the object rather quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
