		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have pointed out, yes those foods have their own chemicals that generate a sensation of &quot;spicy&quot; in some way. There is a biological explanation for this as well if you are interested, read below:</p>
<p>In very general terms, certain foods activate TRP channels (thermotransient receptor potential). </p>
<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Thermotransient-receptor-potential-TRP-channels-Structurally-thermoTRP-are-tetramers_fig1_265421645" target="_blank">https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Thermotransient-receptor-potential-TRP-channels-Structurally-thermoTRP-are-tetramers_fig1_265421645</a></p>
<p>These channels are proteins that help us detect changes in temperature and facilitate pain signals when we are exposed to dangerous changes in temperature which may harm our bodily tissue. </p>
<p>Certain chemicals activate different TRP channels. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Capsaicin activates the &quot;hot&quot; TRP channels&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>The chemicals in mint and wasabi activate the &quot;cold&quot; TRP channels</li>
</ul>
<p>So mint, garlic, cinnamon, and wasabi are all sort of...&quot;cold&quot; burns. The &quot;heat&quot; you feel is the cold sensing TRP channels telling you the temperature is changing too fast in one direction. </p>
<p>Now these chemicals don't actually change the temperature, they bind to the channels and &quot;trick&quot; them into thinking it's cold or hot.</p>
<p>The link I posted at the top of this comment shows a nice &quot;spectrum&quot; of cold to hot TRP channels and what foods activate them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wasabi, mustard, and horseradish have a common active ingredient, allyl isothiocyanate, which in my opinion feels closer to very strong carbonic acid than spicy 'heat', since it doesn't linger or make me feel hot like capsaicin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Black pepper and white pepper (a la &quot;peppercorns&quot;) have a chemical called piperine. It's rated at about 100,000 SHU and triggers the same receptors as our friend capsaicin. If you were to just chew on a peppercorn it would be pretty much identical to taking a bite out of a very spicy pepper like a Habanero, but you wouldn't get the sweet sugars or the other flavorful compounds that give peppers their signature taste. </p>
<p>Other &quot;spicy&quot; foods like mustards, horseradish, radishes, etc. contain a compound called sinigrin. When sinigrin is mixed with water (saliva typically) it is broken down by enzymes into isothiocyanate, which is a very volatile compound and it is often felt not in the mouth or on the tongue as much as it is felt in the nasal cavity as the compound evaporates and travels through the nose.</p>
<p>Because isothiocyanate is much more volatile than capsaicin, the heat doesn't stay around for very long. You can eat a tablespoon of wasabi and be fine in a few seconds after the initial burst of pain, but capsaicin stays on your tongue and in your saliva and continues wreaking havoc on your nerves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They all get their heat or pungency from different chemical compounds.</p>
<p>Pepper (Piper Nigrum) gets its spiciness from piperine.</p>
<p>Mustard and Wasabi get their pungency from Allyl isothiocyanate and 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate.</p>
<p>Ginger gets its pungency from [6]-gingerol, which gets converted to the less pungent zingerone on drying, or the more pungent shogaols on heating or during storage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
