		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Senators are elected to a 6 year term, presidents are elected to a 4 year term, and representatives are elected to a 2 year term. So while the presidential election year garners the most media attention, because many senators, the president, and all representatives, are up for election, halfway through the presidential term (mid-term) all representatives come up for election again.
In order for laws to be passed it requires passing by the house (representatives) and the Senate, and approval by the president. If one party controls both houses of Congress and the Whitehouse, they can get a lot of stuff they want to do passed. If the voters are unhappy, they tend to vote out the controlling party members during the mid-term elections, which makes it harder for one party to pass whatever they want. </p>
<p>On a less ELI5 level, if you look into how Americans tend to vote, you'll see that it's not uncommon for a party to get elected with control of all 3 areas and then lose that control during mid-terms regardless of the party. We also tend to reelect presidents to a second term and then switch parties. So Democrats for 8 years, then Republican for 8 years, then back to Democrats, the back to Republicans. It's been that way for several decades. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called a Midterm election because it falls in the middle of a presidential term, which lasts four years. Every member of the House of Representatives (one of our two legislative houses) is elected every two years. One-third of Senators (the other legislative house) is voted for every two years, as they serve 6 year terms.</p>
<p>Beyond just Senators and House Representatives, there are many local elections taking place. I'm in New York, and I voted for my Governor, State Legislative Representatives, and several local Judges. This is an election, just like any other, where we are picking our representatives for federal, state, and local offices.</p>
<p>At the moment, it is important on the federal level because the President and majority in each legislative house are all from the same party (Republican). This is the first time voters have had the chance to vote since President Trump was elected, and significant gains in the legislative houses by the Democrats will make it so President Trump cannot get laws he wants passed so easily, as well as not having his appointments approved so easily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your question I was interested in this too, my little research said that this is an election period that the American people will vote on political positions such as governors, and other municipal or local positions. They will also vote on the member of Congress which includes the house of representatives and about a third of the seats in the Senate. As for what this will actually mean for the country, I'm not sure. Some have implied that a democratic Congress could impeach Trump, I'm not sure if that's realistic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
