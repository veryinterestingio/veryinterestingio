<p>For a lot of people they need to see their peers following common sense pandemic guidelines or they will stop.  Humans are social animals that largely follow by example.  (Some people are idiots and choose the worst examples)  In order for vaccines to get us to herd immunity we need something like 60% of people to take the vaccine.  This will take quite a while and it'd be nice if things didn't blow up more than they currently are.  Additionally, once people feel like &quot;the pandemic is over&quot; tons of people who would be getting the vaccine will then not get around to it.  Having everyone around them still wearing masks and social distancing helps remind them that we are still in the pandemic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Caveat first about this survey: the NYTimes has been sending these surveys out to a group called the Society for Epidemiological Research. It is a very large and well-respected group, and as the name implies, its members are (mostly) epidemiologists, but most epidemiologists do not work on infectious disease, and SER has traditionally not had a very large membership among infectious disease epidemiologists. The vast (vast) majority of epidemiologists who answered this survey, as well as the previous surveys, do not work on infectious disease and have likely had little training in it (the required ID training in my PhD program was 1 credit hour). I’d also add that epidemiologists (with the exception of those who are also MDs) have mostly been able to work at home during this pandemic, have mostly remained employed, and while we have been subject to plenty of work-related stress, we have been more shielded from some of the other risks than many others.</p>
<p>On to the question. Here are a few reason an epidemiologist, or anyone else, might be more careful with their return to “normal” after vaccination:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We do not yet know if any of the candidate vaccines eliminates (or even decreases) transmission. There is even the possibility that a vaccine might make transmission more likely by increasing the likelihood of asymptomatic infection (I personally think this is unlikely, but it is not impossible, and does occur with some wildlife vaccines).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vaccines will not be 100% effective. Effectiveness (real-world) is always lower than efficacy (clinical trials), so we will likely not see 95% effectiveness. Even with a vaccine where we do (2-dose measles is about 97%), vaccinated people can be infected. We rely both on ourselves being vaccinated and others around us to decrease our risk, and that will take time and (unfortunately) vaccine acceptance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wearing masks, distancing, de-densifying helps create an atmosphere (we hope) where these things are normal and accepted. It’s the same reason I wear a mask when I am out walking my dog even though it’s not required where I live and there is no risk (if I’m not close to anyone). Some people will still need these things because they either aren’t vaccinated yet (remember, rollout will not be immediate to everyone) or at higher risk of vaccine failure / can’t be vaccinated.</p>
</li>
<li>The precautionary principle. We don’t know how long immunity lasts (though I think it’s reasonable based on early data to expect year(s), not months); we don’t know exactly how well it products every single group; we don’t know effectiveness; we don’t know every person’s vaccine status.</li>
</ol>
<p>In reality, it is really no single reason but a combination of all of the above.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don’t know how effective a vaccine really is until after it’s been administered and monitored. If it’s only 50% effective then a lot of people will be walking around thinking they are immune when they aren’t, which brings me to the next point.</p>
<p>Vaccines aren’t immunity and the evidence around reinfection isn’t well understood yet, so if vaccinated people take off their masks, how will they know when they have to put them back on? </p>
<p>Finally, how can people like business owners, airlines and other folks know whether you got an vaccine or if you just don’t like masks? Creates a potential logistical nightmare.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
