		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;optimal&quot; horn grows exponentially in diameter.  An exponential horn creates an impedance match between the small diameter tube and the open air.  It's effectively a hydraulic link- the small end of the bell has higher pressure (which you can push easily with your lungs) but low airflow (so you can blow longer).  The big end of the horn has lower pressure but moves much more air.  In the end this lets you create much more sound.</p>
<p>Most instruments don't have an exactly exponential horn, but it's close.  The length of the horn might be shorter or longer- this changes the frequencies that get amplified the most, changing the sound of the horn.  Long horns, like the winding, gradual increase in a sousaphone, cause longer wavelength, deeper sounds to be amplified the most.  Relatively short bells like that on a trumpet amplify higher pitches.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The flair doesn't actually 'increase' the volume in a conventional way. See, we all know how sound works: when we speak, the pressure produced by the larynx or by an instrument causes the air molecules in the air to vibrate back and forth and reach the other person's eardrums. Now when we normally speak, the sound-waves move around in several directions and our mouths themselves are small so the eardrums, so not only do the sound-waves spread out like ripples in a pond, they don't cause our eardrums vibrate as vigourusly. This is rectified by having a large curvy shape at the end of the horn. The curvy end of the horn is essentially not only forcing the sound-waves to move in one direction(which is also why when we cup our hands, we hear stuff to be 'louder') but it also acts as a more effective interface of the sound-waves crashing into the molecules and does causes us to hear it to be louder.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Essentially, the curvy shape <em>conserves</em> the sound rather than amplify it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now the shape of the flare impacts the pitch of a sound(whether our brain perceives it to be sharp sounding or deep sounding). Larger flares give more mellow and lower pitched sounds as they allow for lower air pressure while smaller flares give more high pitched sounds as they allow for greater air pressure. So musicians usually look for the perfect flare shape which will allow for both high and low pressure so as to get high and low pitched sounds.</p>

<p>I hope that this solved your problem!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The horn shape doesn't <em>increase</em> the volume, but it does conserve the sound so less of it is lost. It's to do with impedance matching, basically reducing reflections and allowing the energy to transfer more efficiently.</p>
<p>There's a great explanation in this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFEB0chiuJA" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFEB0chiuJA" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFEB0chiuJA</a></a> (the key scene is at 2:59, but the whole video is interesting).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In acoustics, vibrations through a pipe are different if itâ€™s open at both ends (like a flute) and closed at one end, like a clarinet or trumpet, where the mouthpiece is closed while the lips or reed vibrate. </p>
<p>The problem with the closed-end instruments is that the notes are very far apart. Without moving fingers, the harmonics would be almost an octave and a half apart! So, the shape of the bell tricks the waves. They selectively amplify parts of the waves to be much closer. This effect is called acoustic pressure, and it makes these instruments act like open ended pipes. </p>
<p>For this reason, horn players can actually play entire scales without moving their fingers, and trumpets, trombones,and tubas have harmonics spaces out closely enough that moving their valves or slides can play all the notes in the musical scale. </p>
<p>This site has a wonderful explanation of the detailed acoustics, complete with sound samples. <a href="http://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/brassacoustics.html#bells" target="_blank">http://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/brassacoustics.html#bells</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
