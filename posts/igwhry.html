		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gold doesn't corrode in normal conditions. This is an advantage for use in electrical <em>contacts</em>, where a layer of oxide or tarnish on the surface would reduce conductivity in the contact.</p>
<p>Wires, circuit board traces, and so on on the other hand are generally made of copper. Almost as good a conductor as silver and less expensive. Permanent connections are made with solder, which nowadays is usually a tin-silver-copper alloy (the old tin-lead alloys having been largely phased out for environmental and health concerns).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Resistance is proportional to wire length and material resistance, and inversely proportional to wire cross sectional area. So if you have the space to put thicker wires, you just put thicker wires and the end result will be almost the same (excluding special cases like extremely high voltages or extremely high frequencies).</p>
<p>So while copper is a little bit worse conductor than silver, its actually much cheaper and engineers just make thicker copper wires instead of silver ones.</p>
<p>For the gold versus silver option, gold is much much more resilient to corrosion and reacts to very little ,,stuff'' even in higher pressure and/or temperature conditions. And gold alloys are more resilient to mechanical loads, like those found in contacts and such, where it is mainly used.</p>
<p>EDIT: As one user pointed out, i made a mistake, instead of inversely proportional to diameter, its actually inversely proportional to cross section area.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Silver oxidizes easier. Additionally, in interconnects, silver requires a forming gas to prevent oxidation of the metal during the high temperature bonding process which makes it more tricky to produce reliable joints.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another problem is silver metallization is highly reactive with environmental sulfur, present in countries with air pollution.  It can cause dendritic growth  and conductive oxidation between vias and traces causing shorting of signals.  It even migrates across solder resist.</p>
<p>Environmental sulfur is particularly an issue in China, India and other countries using high sulfur fuels.  The contaminated air is used to cool computers and associated assemblies.  I've also seen this phenomena in the U.S. near paper mills.  The pulping process often uses corrosive chemicals.</p>
<p>When boards changed from HASL to immersion silver plating for RoHS, this became a high failure source for printed circuit assemblies.  I noticed this particularly on controller PCAs on HDDs.</p>
<p>(I've done research for a major computer company on the issue)</p>
