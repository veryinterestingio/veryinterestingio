		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's basically the ability to generalize. The difference between the sentences &quot;If I throw a rock at a window, it will break.&quot; and &quot;If I throw a hard and heavy object at a rigid but fragile object, it will break.&quot; is that the latter is more abstract. Ability to think in abstract terms allows one to apply their experiences to different situations, which contributes to their overall intelligence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Being able to take an example and extract an underlying pattern that you can see in other areas of life is an example of abstract thinking. The opposite of that would be concrete thinking, which would be taking an idiom like the one above and interpreting it literally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Other people learn like a web.  They can guess pretty well at what is missing between two ideas.  They can make those abstract connections.</p>
<p>They can see patterns and understand what the next step in that pattern is.</p>
<p>People who completely lack that ability tend to struggle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think about a dog.</p>
<p>What kind of dog did you think of? A lot of people think of golden retrievers, but there are a lot of dog breeds. You might have even been thinking of a specific dog. </p>
<p>&quot;Dog&quot; is an abstract concept. It just means a particular kind of animal, and we have to use more specific words like &quot;terrier&quot; to describe specifics. We call those &quot;concrete&quot; ideas.</p>
<p>People who are good at abstract reasoning are good at thinking about things like how &quot;dog&quot; is different from &quot;the big red dog named Clifford&quot;. And when they think like that, they also might note how Elmo, a red muppet, is <em>kind of similar</em> to a big red dog in that they're both red things. &quot;Red things&quot; is an abstract thought. Fire engines are often red, so now we're thinking about those. And apples. And so on.</p>
<p>We consider people who are good at abstract reasoning to be smarter because they tend to be able to solve complex problems with it. When they look at the problem, they know the solution is &quot;something that does X&quot;. So they start to reason, &quot;What are things that do that?&quot; A less abstract person can only solve problems if they have experiences that teach them how. </p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Suppose I ask two people to explain how to boil water with an assortment of household items in front of them. A tea kettle or a pot is the &quot;best&quot; answer. But what if I didn't give them one? </p>
<p>A person who thinks abstractly might note I've included a glass bowl and some candles. That's a heat source and something that can hold water, which is <em>like</em> a stove and a pot. So that <em>could</em> maybe boil some water. A person who does not think abstractly might never notice. To them, you need a stove and a pot and they see neither so they're stuck.</p>
<p>That's why abstract thinking is useful for problem solving. Once you describe what you want, you can start thinking about things that are <em>like</em> what you want and some combination of those things are probably a solution. If you can't think through abstraction very well, you can only solve problems you've been taught how to solve, which is still useful but not <em>as</em> useful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a great scene in South Park where scientists were trying to figure something out and there was this massive wall of math calculations and <del>Wendy</del> Heidi looked at it and asked whether they thought a couple of statements were out of order. They realized she was right and she explained she had no idea what anything actually meant so she replaced it with things she did know about and applied the same logic and found that in her abstraction the sentences were out of order. Even though she didn't what it meant, she saw the logical problem anyway. That is abstraction and it is something humans do very well.</p>
<p>If you ever learn computer science the idea of abstraction starts right away, it is the idea that your can 'put a box around' something and instead of learning the exact mechanics of how that box works, you learn how that box interacts with the larger system. Essentially abstraction lets us 'know enough' to make good decisions without knowing everything. Understanding how abstractions can lead you astray is the true genius.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
