<p>With a focus on creating lasting impact and continual progression towards net zero deforestation by 2030, we're excited to discuss our upcoming global initiatives and the impact of our projects that is felt directly and immediately by local indigenous communities. Using our pragmatic approach to forest protection we focus on community-based work and building partnerships with a range of stakeholders allowing us to protect forests in a way that is measurable and lasting.</p>
<p>Join us during one of our upcoming global initiative events:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello. My question is that many people say that deforestation can be solved by aforestation. But aforestation is just planting trees where they werenâ€™t before. This is not good enough as it doesn't restore the ecosystem that was destroyed by deforestation. So is there any way to completely restore the destroyed ecosystem? If not, can such an ecosystem be made artificially?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
