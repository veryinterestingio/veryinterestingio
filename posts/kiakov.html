		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Urine is what's filtered out of the blood, and carries with it all the stuff you don't want in the blood.</p>
<p>The water you drink goes into your blood and replenishes.</p>
<p>There's a huge gap between the two, and they are two (almost) separate systems.  One signals &quot;Hey, the blood is drying up, we need more water, make him thirsty&quot;, the other signals &quot;Hey, this blood is too watery, let's skim some of it off&quot;.</p>
<p>In between, the blood is doing its actual job, however, so it needs constant replenishment and cleaning anyway.</p>
<p>It's like your toilet tank.  There's one thing in there that, when the water gets low, it adds more water.  There's another thing that, when the water is too high, it lets it drain away.  But the stock of water in between is not static in your body, it's being used to make the blood flow, to wash away contaminants and dead cells, etc. so it dirties.</p>
<p>So instead we have a constant trickle in and a constant trickle out, but it also means that you can - at some points - be thirsty, so you drink, but you drink so much so fast that your kidneys then immediately say &quot;Hey, this blood is too watery, it's dangerous, we need to get rid&quot;.</p>
<p>The buffer in between is what confuses people, and that's basically the circulation of the water throughout your entire bloodstream, several times over, before it's skimmed off and urinated away.</p>
<p>And, yes, you can die of having too much water in your blood - people have died while participating in water-drinking contests, and it doesn't take as much as you'd think.  Because when the blood gets too watery, and it can't get rid of it quick enough, it washes away the salts, and your brain etc. become no longer electrically conductive.</p>
<p>But the water does not go into your &quot;stomach&quot; and then get peed away from there directly, that's not how it works.  Fresh water enters your bloodstream, circulates picking up contaminants, and then is used to wash those contaminants out of your body.  The body has already &quot;filtered&quot; that water and then deliberately put toxins, etc. into it and now needs to ditch it to get rid of those toxins, it can't recirculate it and it can't let the toxins build up.  If it could do that, you'd never need to drink water except to top-up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We already do.  Part of the kidneys' function is the reabsorption of water from filtered blood.  Also, sometimes we have excess water in our bodies and we need to excrete it to maintain a proper balance of hydration.</p>
<p>Urine is also a fantastic way to expel waste products from metabolism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>We use some of it in chemical processes, this gets converted into other chemicals, so isnâ€™t water anymore.</li>
<li>We use it to dissolve waste products so they can get removed. Our kidneys try to recover as much as possible, but they have limited efficiency </li>
<li>We use it for sweat to keep cool. This water evaporates away and is gone.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Urinating is how the body gets rid of excess water so it's tempting to think that all of the water in urine was excess.</p>
<p>However, urinating is also the way that the body gets rid of certain wastes.  Those wastes are carried out of the body using water, so urinating <em>is</em> using that water.  &quot;Reusing&quot; the water after that point is possible in dire scenarios, though obviously it's preferable to use fresh water instead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
