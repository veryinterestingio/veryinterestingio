		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From doing some basic research, it appears that hand soaps are slightly stronger.  That's basically the only difference.</p>
<p>The real key to why these exist is marketing.  I took an advertising class in college and learned about the principle of marketing where people will pay more for and buy more of products packaged for specific uses even if the products themselves are identical.  Somehow that idea the these are supposed to be specialized tricks the mind into thinking they are worth more.  So for example, if you've ever looked at all the various types of cold medicine for different symptoms which usually cost more than a generic cold medicine for all symptoms, know that in most cases the medicine is identical just with different labels slapped on the packages or bottles.</p>
<p>Same principle here.  They can charge more for separate hand and body soaps even if there is no difference and people will buy more of them than they will for generic soap.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, what we call soap is a mixture of surfactants with other chemicals that creates a detergent specific to certain needs - so basically it's all &quot;soap&quot; but with different chemicals mixtures and different pH level depending on what it's used for. </p>
<p>Your skin and hair are fundamentally different, your skin is living and regenerates the outer layer on a regular basis, your hair is mostly dead material grown from live cells below the surface of your scalp.</p>
<p>Shampoo is generally a surfactant + a co-surfactant and is made to be gentle on keratin which is important to your hair. It's also formulated to lather well, rinse out quickly, and be less irritating towards eyes. </p>
<p>Body soap and hand soap are made with a mild surfactant to not irritate/dry out your skin, and often have stuff like moisturizers added. They are also more concentrated than shampoo, and have more surfactants, shampoo has a low level of surfactants because they can strip the necessary protective oils off your hair and it can become dry and damaged.</p>
<p>If you wash your body with shampoo you may feel kinda slimy because it's a different type and strength of detergent. It's build to be mild and cleanse without degreasing or stripping oils. </p>
<p>If you wash your hair with body soap, it might dry out your hair but honestly I do this a lot and if your hair can handle it it's less weird than using shampoo as body wash. There are a lot of different textures and types of hair though so shampoo tends to be more specialized, and depending on your hair type you might damage your hair by using body wash on it.</p>
<p>Face washes tend to have ingredients specific to preventing/treating acne like salicylic acid.</p>
<p>Laundry detergent is super highly concentrated and is meant to be diluted by all the water in a washing machine. This is why when you get detergent on your hand it takes so long to get off. </p>
<p>Dish soap like Dawn has a heavy detergent to degrease dishes/plates and can be harsh on skin. They tend to add moisturizers and stuff to be kinder on your hands, but the purpose it to degrease plates not wash yourself so it's a lot harsher on skin than a body wash. </p>
<p>So yes you can technically use any soap for anything but there are actual differences in the chemical make up (not just marketing) and it can be either less effective or lead to dry skin, dry or damaged hair, irritated skin etc.</p>
<p>TDLR: They are different formulas because of different needs. Body soap and hand soap are the most similar though, hand soap is just a bit more of an intense detergent because it is often used as an antibacterial as well  </p>
<p>(Edited to add the TDLR + typos)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's just marketing. You can wash your hands with shampoo if you want, it'll act just like soap. Sure, hand soaps are gentler on your skin than, like, Ajax dish liquid. But they're both still soap for all intents and purposes, the Ajax liquid is just harsher on your skin. Some body soap has moisturizers that may work well for your skin and help make it soft... but aside from little stuff like that, soap is soap.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We used to use dawn for hand soap. Now I have switched to bar soap for all hand body and hair soaps. Hand and body are the same, but I have a fancier bar shampoo for my hair. This saves me money and makes me feel better since I am reducing my plastic waste.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
