		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The laws and regulations around children acting are <em>very</em> strict and they are under constant supervision. They also only get about 4 hours of actually working (depending on age) per day. For babies, it's why they go for twins so often, like the Olson sisters when they were doing Full House. One works, and when that time is up, they switch 'em out. </p>
<p>There is also mandatory tutoring, break times, and protection off their pay so evil parents can't rip them off. That's from a case involving Jackie Coogan getting stiffed by his folks when he was a kid. (Jackie Coogan was Uncle Fester in the old Addams Family tv show. )</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Child acting and artistic work is actually one thing that is excluded from prohibiting children from working. It was debated and specifically chosen to be excluded. As a result of being allowed, its for the most part, heavily regulated and enforced about how children must be treated and employed in this case</p>
<p>Basically, it was debated, and decided to be allowed but regulated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The laws are very strict for child actors. Even on a small local commercial or indie film, production needs to hire a Studio Teacher if there will be any children on set. Leads or background, doesn’t matter. The teachers are also there to protect the children and to make sure production is treating them right.</p>
<p>When they aren’t on set acting they are often in tutoring, even on weekend shoots.</p>
<p>This is often why they cast 20 somethings to play high schoolers. It’s kind of a pain to hire children-it’s more money and a longer shoot schedule.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are limits to working hours. My sister's twins will be in Britannia S2. And the could only be on set for 3 hours. Once that limit was reached, they were rushed off set as it was illegal for them to be there after. Many days she travelled to parts of UK to film and if there were delays, after 3 hours she would have to leave even if no filming was done. Still got paid though</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
