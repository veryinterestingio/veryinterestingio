		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An anchor is like a claw. Go outside, find a patch of soil, dig your fingers right into the earth and try to drag your hand along parallel with the ground. Difficult, isn't it?</p>
<p>Now do the same again - really dig your fingers in, and then pull it straight up. Your hand lifts right out! </p>
<p>This is how an anchor works. The anchor and chain prevent horizontal movement (like the wind and tide) by digging in like a claw, and when the ship comes to leave, the crew winds in the chain and rope until the ship is above the anchor, and it pops right out.</p>
<p>Edit: A spelling.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Thank you for the Reddit silver, kind stranger! To all of you who commented on the weight of chain doing most of the work, I'm aware of that, but this is ELI5 not ELI15. I don't expect a child to understand friction, shear strength and fluke angles. Happy sailing!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

But the boat is free to move towards the anchor. So the boat can just move to where the anchor lies on the ground and pull it up into the boat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For heavier ships, the chain does most of the work.</p>
<p>The anchor point is mostly for the initial grab of the sea floor. It's designed wedge itself into the sand when dragged. As the chain is put out, more and more of it is laid on the sea floor while a good portion of it remains taught between the ship and the links on the floor. The total weight of chain on the sea floor vastly exceeds the weight of the anchor and greatly contributes to holding onto the sea floor.</p>
<p>To get out, as the ship retracts the chain, the ship is pulled closer and closer to the anchor point as the chain is peeled off the surface. At some point the chain is near vertical. The anchor is designed to be easily pulled vertically away from the sea floor. The force it takes to rotate the anchor towards the surface is very small compared to the force it would take to pull it across the sea floor</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A question that( as a seafarer) I can finally answer, sort of! As stated above removing the anchor vertically is far easier than dragging it along the seafloor. However sometimes an anchor never even needs to touch the seafloor at all! Interestingly enough the actual weight of the anchor chain plays a large part in keeping the ship steady. Based on wind and current speed you pay out a certain number of shots, (15 ft lengths of chain) in order to remain steady. Of course anchor chains for modern cargo ships are intensely large and heavy for this reason. Imagine if you were swimming in deep water (with floaties, no drowning please) and had a 40 to 50 lb weight dangling below you. It'd be pretty difficult to swim around I'd say.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
