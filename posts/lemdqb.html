Every year, vaccines are adapted in an attempt to catch the latest mutation. Problem is the latest mutation can be quicker than our efforts leading to larger outbreaks of influenza once every couple of years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your question implies intent that doesn't exist.  A virus does not &quot;mutate to evade our vaccines&quot;.  It mutates usually because it's not great at copying itself.  As it mutates a new strain may be more infectious and thus spread more, there are surely other mutations that spread less but they are more likely to die out or be less noticeable.</p>
<p>It's also important to know that at least the Pfizer vaccine is still effective against the South African and British mutations.  So the virus is still being slowed by them.  There is now way to know though about any further mutations and if the current vaccines will work for those.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a medical expert, by any means. But I read something that appears to make sense.</p>
<p>The rate of mutatation is directly related to the rate of spread. If you reduce the rate of spread of a disease, it has fewer opportunities to mutate. By vaccinating for the original strain, you should see fewer mutations.</p>
<p>This is why you need to vaccinate everyone, including the poorer countries.  If you leave them out, you leave 4 billion vectors of the new covid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No it won’t run out of mutations but viruses mutate into less deadly variants over time because it helps them spread more easily.</p>
<p>For example the more deadly Spanish Flu of 1918 was much more deadly than Coronavirus, and its mutated offspring still circulate the globe, yet people aren’t dying from these variants</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
