		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If a neutron star, or equivalent, is collapsing as it has enough mass to overcome the strong nuclear interaction, how would it become a black hole? As soon as some matter from the core collapses within the Schwarzchild radius, wouldn't it evaporate extremely quickly (or explode) due to massive Hawking radiation? For example this calculator (<a href="http://xaonon.dyndns.org/hawking/" target="_blank">http://xaonon.dyndns.org/hawking/</a>) suggests that the first 1 micro-gram of the black hole will evaporate in less than 1 unit of Plank time. Does the rest of the collapsing matter need to supply the micro black hole with more matter/energy than is lost due the radiation? Is it even relativistically possible for it to collapse fast enough to do that? Even if so, would it be possible for it to fail (due to angular velocity for example), and if it fails would the neutron star potentially blow up instead of collapsing?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The black hole doesn’t form gradually- it suddenly collapses once all the mass of the star is within the Schwarzschild radius.</p>
<p>The sun has a Schwarzschild radius of just under two miles within its core, but that doesn’t mean a mini black hole is forming inside it.</p>
<p>To give another example, we each have our own very small Schwarzschild radius, but all our mass would have to be compressed to within that radius to form a black hole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other people have given good answers. I would like to add the following: the Schwarzschild radius increases linearly with mass (r_s = 2 G m / c^2 ). The volume of a sphere increases with the 3rd power of the radius, hence, the volume of an incompressible object with fixed density rho increases only with power 1/3 of the radius.</p>
<p>Volume of sphere: V = 4/3 pi r^3;</p>
<p>Radius of sphere: r = (3/(4 pi) V)^(1/3), we can rewrite as r = K V^(1/3)</p>
<p>Radius of sphere containing mass m: r = K (m/rho)^1/3</p>
<p>Schwarzschild radius of mass m: r_s = 2 G m / c^2</p>
<p>Because the Schwarzschild radius grows linearly with mass and the radius of the star with the cubic root of the mass, the Schwarzschild radius grows faster and will overtake the radius of the star when r_s = s. Solving this for mass provides the formula m = sqrt( 3 c^6 / (8 pi G^3 rho) ). The whole star (or core of the star) becomes a black hole at once, since any part of the star on its own doesn't have the critical mass to become a black hole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Only stars with very large masses can form black holes when those stars go Supernova.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Though the events leading up to it's creation are a chain reaction, once the conditions are met the distortion of spacetime which renders a black hole is immediate. Black holes of a few solar masses are colder than the cosmic microwave background causing them to accrete mass in the vacuum. </p>
<p>Black holes eventually evaporate, however that product is calculated on the surface, and thus takes exponentially longer to disappear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Idk if anyone has said this but also the rate at which is gives off Hawking radiation is VERY slow compared to even a low average of how much matter it’s constantly pulling in. Even in empty space there is one atom per cubic meter or mile or something like that and a black hole absorbing one atom  per like hour is much more than it gets rid of per hour, so until the almost death of the universe where there is nothing left they will still be increasing in size over time not getting smaller. Only near the time that there is literally nothing left and space has expanded extremely will they then start to give off more energy through radiation than they are taking in </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
