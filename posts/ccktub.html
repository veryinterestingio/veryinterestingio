		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gender, age and genetics all play a major role in determining where our body decides to distribute our body fat and how much it decides to build up, but because of the many diverse factors like diets, activity levels and just general backgrounds, many people come in many sizes and shapes, and this makes it hard to determine the specific reason for its development and distribution patterns. Not to mention there are different types of fat, which can also determine how it is formed and where it is distributed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's genetic. Next time you're at the family reunion, notice how everyone is kind of shaped the same. Some people are predisposed to carry more fat around the mid section (apple shape), and some people are predisposed to carry more fat in the hips and (pear shape). </p>
<p>There are other variations, and not everyone fits exactly into one category or the other, but you'll notice that people who are related tend to be of the same body type. There's nothing you can do about this genetic predisposition, other than just not carrying extra fat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
