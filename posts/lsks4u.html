		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is a very, very over-simplified answer: <strong>a growing society increases economic growth and that creates inflation because it causes a bunch of things to happen.</strong></p>
<p>With that quick answer out of the way, this is a great question and it is well-studied area of economics. Unfortunately, the answer is super complex and depends on a number of things. Here are a few factors that may drive inflation with some of the key names bolded below.</p>
<p><strong>What is Inflation?</strong></p>
<p>First, let's look at the definition of inflation. Inflation is just the general rise in the price level of goods in an economy over time. If we want to measure inflation, we can take a basket of say 200 goods (milk, 1lb of steel, etc.) in say 1950 and take the average price of those goods in the market that uses that currency at that time (e.g., the U.S.). This establishes a baseline for what those 200 goods cost and gives us what economists call a &quot;consumer price index&quot; (CPI). </p>
<p><strong>Demand-Pull Inflation</strong></p>
<p>But we know that populations tend to grow exponentially (i.e., people have more and more babies). The more people there are, the higher overall demand goes for certain staple products like milk, steel, and so on. Companies react by trying to grow larger to meet this demand. This spurs investment in the company, increased hiring to meet demand, increased consumption of goods used in production, and so on. This decreases things like unemployment, which increases demand for goods since people have more money to spend, which increases hiring, etc. But supply is not a simple line. Increasing the average output of a company (i.e., the supply) takes time, so when demand for a product increases and supply has yet to grow sufficiently, we have a period of time where demand cannot be met. In an over-simplified market, if we have a limited supply and demand cannot be met, the equilibrium price goes up because people are generally more willing to pay a higher price for those goods. This example is referred to as <strong>&quot;Demand-pull inflation&quot;</strong> and is generally a Keynesian view.</p>
<p><strong>Cost-Push Inflation</strong></p>
<p>This is only one small piece of the puzzle. Imagine you own a dairy farm in 1950 and you need to meet this increased demand for milk. One way to increase your output is to make better technologies that increase your output. Fortunately, there is a company that just made such a machine. They spent years in R&amp;D to make this new device and they want to make back their investment, so initially the price is high. The farmer calculates that if he puts out 100K now he can recoup his costs over 3 years and actually make more money in the long-run. So the farmer makes the purchase and hedges his investment by increasing the price of milk. Thus the price goes up from that factor as well. This is an example of <strong>&quot;Cost-push inflation&quot;</strong>, which is also a typically Keynesian view.</p>
<p><strong>Built-In Inflation</strong></p>
<p>Additionally, as price goes up, the purchasing power of each dollar goes down. When the purchasing power of each dollar goes down, people will demand more money for services and goods to either maintain their purchasing power or as a way to predict future inflation based on their past experiences (the latter of which is part of <strong>&quot;rational expectations theory&quot;</strong>). This is an example of <strong>&quot;Built-in inflation&quot;</strong>, which is also a typically Keynesian view, and is related to the <strong>&quot;price/wage spiral&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Velocity of Money, Money Supply, and the Quantity Theory of Money</strong></p>
<p>To continue on, the actions above all may increase the &quot;velocity of money&quot; (i.e., the amount of times that a unit of currency is used in commerce in a given period of time). If the government does not increase the overall amount of money in a society, then trade may slow down because the demand for more money for services and goods is not being met initially. Think of the economy like an engine. The more activity that takes place in the engine, the more oil we need to keep the processes (i.e., commerce) moving smoothly. So the government may increase the money supply to keep things running smoothly. </p>
<p>But let's say that we view the government as increasing money supply too soon. Perhaps they are trying to stay ahead of the curve. In this case, the demand for money can be viewed as relatively stable in the short term and depends on nominal income, interest rates, etc. and that there is an inherent interest rate to the market (i.e., a &quot;real interest&quot; rate determined by things like productivity, time preferences, etc.). In this case, our view might be that money velocity is relatively stable in the short run and prices move easily, so the government's increase in the money supply is responsible for the inflation. This is generally a <strong>Monetarist view</strong> that relates to the <strong>&quot;quantity theory of money&quot;</strong> (MV = PQ), but I'm oversimplifying it in a number of ways. </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>These are all different, intertwined mechanisms and they are not necessarily exclusive from one another. It just depends on what assumptions you make about the economy and how you view certain aspects. If you think prices are sticky and that the velocity of money is not stable in the short run, then you might adopt a Keynesian view of which factors play a larger role. On the other hand, if you think the opposite, you might adopt a Monetarist view <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation#Causes" target="_blank">This wikipedia article</a> gives a great overview of some of the main drivers if you want to read further. It also discusses some Austrian views that are more tied to ideal markets. For a deeper dive on that, Hayek has a decent book called &quot;Good Money&quot;. </p>
<p>This is all from my economics undergrad work and some additional work in grad school so I'm sure a number of people with more advanced econ degrees can correct me or add to it. That being said, I think this covers some of the key areas in this field.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A little inflation is actually a good thing. It causes people to take money that would be sitting on the sidelines and invest it. Generally, inflation transfers wealth from those who have money to those who are earning wages through labor.</p>
<p>If inflation reverses, creating deflation, then bad things happen. People hold onto money with the expectation that stuff gets cheaper. This causes recessions and unemployment, causing more deflation. </p>
<p>But also, too much inflation is bad. It erodes wealth and harms people who live on fixed incomes. It’s best to have a small positive value of inflation, something like 2% per year. Over time this causes what you’re describing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So other posters have gotten you the inflation part, but that isn't why the golden gate bridge would cost billions. Permitting, acquiring the land, environmental impact study, safety, and labor costs have driven the cost of construction way high. To give you some perspective on it, I used to work for a highway that went through not very terribly valuable land. Each bridge we built cost a minimum of $400,000 in 1998 money. We are talking a bridge that is about 5 meters high that crosses over a small stream.</p>
<p>People also, somehow, missed the historic events of disjoining us from the gold standard (1933-1973) and the historic inflation of the 1970s, partly caused by leaving the gold standard, which saw inflation around 20%. Most of the &quot;gosh this thing used to cost a nickel and now it is $1.99&quot; or whatever came from around that period. We also see inflation tend to increase when the cost of commodities rise quickly, which happened in the 70s and the mid-2000s, specifically oil. If you look at a graph of inflation in the USA it tracks with prices of energy nice and neatly - but that isn't the only indicator of inflation. If something you need to buy gets much more expensive you will likely have inflation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/2497/historical-inflation-rate-by-year" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/2497/historical-inflation-rate-by-year" target="_blank">https://www.macrotrends.net/2497/historical-inflation-rate-by-year</a></a></p>
<p>Also, as women entered the workforce in the 70s, people bid up the prices for goods and services since they could now afford them in dual income households. This is why a good daycare costs an astronomical amount of money and a family car that cost $18000 in 1994 now costs damn near $38,000. The key to remember is that this is part inflation but part consumer preference, with dual income and the ability to bid up prices that family car is a fundamentally different product than the one was in 1994. Inflation alone would make that car $32,000; and it costs Honda less to build and distribute it today! Now you want airbags all over the place, auto-braking, radar controlled cruise control, 33 speed automatics, power windows all around, voice activated whatever, GPS, smartphone integration, 33 mpg, 0-60 in 5.whatever seconds.</p>
<p>So remember, consumer preference, getting rid of the gold standard, women entering the workforce, monetary policy. When those things don't change much (we are past the gold standard, women have been working for a generations now, we are all cool with imports, energy prices are generally going down) inflation is minimal. You still see inflation in specific markets, like houses, but the CPI inflation remains pretty low. Groceries are expensive, sure, but they have always been an expensive part of the family budget. </p>
<p>This is one reason why the fed isn't really all the worried about runaway inflation ala 1970s, nothing has really fundamentally changed. We could be worried about an innovation gap, or some truly stupid monetary moves like creating a liquidity trap, which could drive stagnant growth, which could cause inflation - but there aren't a ton of indicators that those are huge risks right now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>saw a lecture which said that inflation is a tax on savings which makes sense to me!</p>
<p>let's say that one egg costs $1,  after the inflation rate increases it's now $2 but the money supply has also doubled so it doesn't really matter... right? now let's say you saved $100 before inflation went up, well you still just have $100 even after the money supply has doubled, so you basically lost 50% of your savings, which is really bad for retirement accounts &amp; college savings iirc</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fractional reserve banking has turned the world into a ponzi scheme that must grow exponentially or collapse. The system automatically creates exponentially more debt and money and transfers wealth to the financial sector like a money vacuum. </p>
<p>Inflation is a hidden tax to the capitalist class. The new money gets into their hands first. As they make us work for it it loses value. </p>
<p>The banks need inflation to cover the exponentially growing debt. It's pretty much a scam. Borrow one dollar in the fractional reserve banking system and you are looking at an endless exponentially growing debt. So endless more money needs to be made. Lest the banks repossess the whole world. </p>
<p>Check out fractional reserve banking and work it out on a piece of paper. Most economists either ignore banking or make excuses but the only reason for this system is to make the capitalist class as wealthy and powerful as possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
