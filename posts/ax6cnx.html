		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An award-winning journalist and leading international social researcher make the provocative argument that the global population will soon begin to decline, dramatically reshaping the social, political, and economic landscape.</p>
<p>For half a century, statisticians, pundits, and politicians have warned that a burgeoning population will soon overwhelm the earth's resources. But a growing number of experts are sounding a different alarm. Rather than continuing to increase exponentially, they argue, the global population is headed for a steep decline-and in many countries, that decline has already begun.</p>
<p>In Empty Planet, John Ibbitson and Darrell Bricker find that a smaller global population will bring with it many benefits: fewer workers will command higher wages; the environment will improve; the risk of famine will wane; and falling birthrates in the developing world will bring greater affluence and autonomy for women. </p>
<p>But enormous disruption lies ahead, too. We can already see the effects in Europe and parts of Asia, as aging populations and worker shortages weaken the economy and impose crippling demands on healthcare and social security. The United States and Canada are well-positioned to successfully navigate these coming demographic shifts--that is, unless growing isolationism leads us to close ourselves off just as openness becomes more critical to our survival than ever.</p>
<p>Rigorously researched and deeply compelling, Empty Planet offers a vision of a future that we can no longer prevent--but one that we can shape, if we choose.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is your claim that population will fall earlier than many forecasters predict based on (a) existing scientific consensus, (b) your own research, or (c) other research that is not the consensus opinion?</p>
<p>If (a), why do you reach a different conclusion from professional population forecasters at, for example, the UN? If (b), did you publish this work as peer-reviewed articles before the mass-market book? How was the reaction to them? If (c), on what issues does the scientific community disagree and why?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is it the case that population is declining only in &quot;first world countries&quot; while remaining stable, or even growing, in poorer places?</p>
<p>If so, wouldn't the economic problems be solved through migration and adoption of foreign workers?</p>
<p>Or do you honestly see a decline in population in places such as Brazil, Mexico, and India? (sorry, most Catholic/populous places I could think of)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Every time I’m in traffic I think we are probably due for a plague.
What are some negative aspects of an overall decline in population?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
