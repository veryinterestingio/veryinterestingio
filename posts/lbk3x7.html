		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a pretty clever little thing.</p>
<p>The end of the gas tank nozzle has a separate small tube in it that connects into the gas pump handle. You pull the trigger, and that tiny tube starts sucking in air while the larger hose goes about pumping gas.</p>
<p>That little tube is connected at the upper end to a pressure sensor which cuts off the gas flow when it's triggered. As long as the end of the little hose is clear to suck in air, the pressure stays the same and gas will pump. But the second the pressure goes up, the sensor says STOP.</p>
<p>As you fill up, eventually the gas level in your tank climbs so it's now covering the tiny hole. Having to suck liquid instead of air is a little harder, and that change from one to the other instantly changes the pressure and causes that sensor to fire to cut off the gas.</p>
<p>So the gas always stops when it reaches a certain level, and the odds that we get more tragic Zoolander scenes are greatly reduced.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The tip of the pump nozzle has a small hole that essentially sucks fuel back into the pipe as a sensor. This is not enough suction to pull fuel being dispensed but rather when the tip of the nozzle is submerged. This means the moment your fuel level touches the nozzle and any fuel is sucked into that tiny hole, the sensor detects it and the pump cuts flow.</p>
<p>This is why you might get it cutting out if the flow splashes back onto the nozzle as you start pumping and then you have to restart pumping.</p>
<p>Added tip: Only fill up in the morning or at colder times of the day as fuel is more dense when cool thus you effectively get more fuel for the same quantity pumped.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a follow up question to this after reading the answers </p>
<p>I had a car, a 2002 highlander if that matters that I got as a hand me down from my mom </p>
<p>One day I went to fill up my empty tank. The gas pump would shut off like the tank was full after only a little bit would go in. </p>
<p>This continued to happen, but only at certain gas stations. I had to avoid shell and chevrons or else I would be sitting there pumping like 0.2 gallons at a time.</p>
<p>My thought was that my tank wasn’t releasing the air as the gas filled the tank, so it would think it’s full based on the pressure..but if there’s a hose sucking the air out why would this happen?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
