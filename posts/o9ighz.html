		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The body goes through a process called autophagy where old and damaged cells are upcycled in healthy cells. You're body is totally fine assuming you not underweight. You'd need to make sure you drink a lot of water and include electrolytes. People can fast up to 3 days without safely, but any longer and you have to be VERY CAREFUL about breaking the fast. Refeeding syndrome can be deadly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're eating a normal diet before you start fasting, you generally have enough nutrients in your body (fat cells, food that might still be in the process of being digested in your body when you started, dying cells in your body that are recycled to feed other cells, free-floating nutrients in your blood, etc) to last you a decent while.</p>
<p>Additionally, many of your biological functions that are required, generally have a range of what is optimal, and what is the bare minimum you can run on.  This is why you might feel hungry if you skip a meal, or sleepy if you pull an all-nighter, but won't suddenly starve to death because you got stuck in traffic trying to get home for dinner.</p>
<p>However, if you're talking about complete 100% fasting for several days, depending on what your body has stored up, you quite literally could be doing damage to yourself, especially if you didn't have a balanced diet beforehand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans have evolved to be scavengers. We didn't magically pop into existence next to a permanently stocked supermarket. Sometimes we didn't find enough food for a while. Finding varied food may have been even harder</p>
<p>Staying alive is not rocket science. Just make sure you keep drinking, and you'll survive without any food for 3 weeks. It's not pleasant, but you'll be mostly fine</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
