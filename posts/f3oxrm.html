Corrective lenses fix this by focusing the light onto a smaller area. A pinhole effectively accomplishes the same, albeit at the obvious cost of field of view.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the same reason as a pinhole camera works.  Also the same as why a smaller aperture on a normal camera lens helps focus.</p>
<p><a href="https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/question131.htm" target="_blank">https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/question131.htm</a></p>
<p>So that's probably the easiest way to understand it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you imagine a piece of paper pointed at an outside scene, with nothing else in front of it. The paper will just be lit white, because it's getting light from all over the scene in front of it. </p>
<p>The reason a hole does what it does is because it restricts the possible directions a particular point on the paper can be getting light from. </p>
<p>Now imagine the paper is stuck in the back of a box, that's entirely enclosed except for a little hole in the front wall of the box. What I'm describing is pretty much a pinhole camera. </p>
<p>If you imagine the top left corner of the piece of paper. You imagine you're looking from the point of view of that top corner of paper. You can see nothing, except what's coming through that pinhole. But because it's such a small hole, all you can see is what's directly through the hole in the direction you're looking, and that's all. You can't see what's directly ahead of the box from there, all you can see is what's directly in a line from that top corner of the paper, through the hole to outside. </p>
<p>If you imagine that's the case for <em>any</em> point on the paper. If you're in the middle of the piece of paper, you can see through the hole to whatever's directly ahead of the hole outside. If you're at the bottom right point on the paper, you can only see what's out the top left of the hole, that kind of thing. </p>
<p>What that will actually do is be generating a fully focussed (but upside down and back to front) image on the paper of what's in front of the box, just from the light coming through that pinhole.</p>
<p>That's why looking through a small hole gives you a more focussed picture. Because it's only letting a certain point on your retina see a certain point of the view in front, and nothing else. It's doing just the same as what focussing with a lens would do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light and the images you see is coming from many different directions and needs to be focused into one point in your eye to see.<br />
When you have blurry vision, this focus or focal point is slightly off so you are seeing multiple &quot;images&quot; at slightly the wrong place, this is what makes things look blurry.  </p>
<p>When you look through a pinhole or small hole, a lot of those extra images are being blocked from reaching your eye so you don't get as much blurriness.  Less light is reaching your eye though so your vision is darker but sharper.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, as noted, this is the pinhole effect.  It does not focus the light <em>at all.</em>  But it makes the depth of field, or the &quot;in focus&quot; range so big, it significantly improves the image.  They won't let me post an image, but if you an image search for &quot;pinhole effect&quot;, all will be made clear.</p>
<p>I'm an optometrist, and also used to work as a photographer.</p>
<p>And it has little or no effect on field of view.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
