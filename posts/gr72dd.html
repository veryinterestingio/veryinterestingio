		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sort of a morbid question, I know. A friend had a nest of robins in their yard, and just found all the babies dead under the nest, and hypothesized that a lack of food could be the cause of death. I didn't think that was likely, but didn't want to bring it up or force the issue when my friend is quite sad about the dead baby birds. I figure that if the mama bird knew that she wasn't finding enough food, she would choose one of her babies to favor and feed with what she could find, to give the best chance of her genes surviving in the next generation. Is this true? Or would she feed them equally and let them all die? If it informs the answer, the mother is still alive. Thanks in advance!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure how universally this can be applied across all birds, but there are certainly some species with clear evidence of favouritism.  In fact, in some cases this extends beyond just preferential feeding to active infanticide.  See <a href="https://bioone.org/journals/Acta-Ornithologica/volume-37/issue-2/068.037.0207/Brood-Reduction-and-Parental-Infanticide--are-the-White-Stork/10.3161/068.037.0207.full" target="_blank">Zielínski 2002</a> on storks for example, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnRm4zlWea4" target="_blank">this video</a> (warning: not really graphic, but potentially disturbing).  In other species, there is often harsh competition between offspring for food, which again may rise to the level of siblicide (see a review by <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/29774180?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents" target="_blank">Mock et al. 1990</a>).  This is actually the norm in masked boobies, which lay two eggs but only have one offspring reach maturity, as can be seen in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSDHpPZB9Ng" target="_blank">this rather overdramatized video</a>.  The evolutionary dynamics of this system are quite interesting, and I recommend checking out some of the work on it by <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/285049" target="_blank">Anderson 1990a</a> and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1990.tb04312.x" target="_blank">1990b</a>.  So in summary, there are definitely at least some species where parents are perfectly willing to sacrifice one offspring to help the others, though there may be exceptions where this is never observed too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It isn’t nice to find an abandoned nest. Birds often abandon nests if they feel threatened, eg if they see predators nearby. Some birds breed in pairs, either for the breeding season or until one dies. If one dies they have to form a new pair and start a new nest as they can’t feed the chicks alone, their next brood has a better chance. If food is a problem, they do feed the strongest offspring first. It sounds morbid but it is survival.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Weaker birds will stop shouting for food before stronger ones when starved so they will get less food and die before their stronger siblings. This will continue until there's enough food to go around for the baby birds that are left.</p>
<p>Finding the entire contents of a nest dead under a tree all of a sudden is more likely the work of a playful neighborhood cat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nature is rarely compassionate. It could also have been the result of disease, parasites, or a predator. And, there are other species of birds like Cuckoos and Cowbirds who lay their eggs in other birds’ nests and even push out existing eggs or fledglings in the process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When female sharks have two offspring in the womb, one will more likely kill/consume the other. And I know of several breeds of dogs that will either shun certain offspring until the point of starvation and death, or down-right eat their young to ensure the best outcome of the other offspring. It kinda sucks and is morbid,  but it makes sense, and is probably the reason that we humans exist today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
