		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By &quot;psychological&quot; I'm assuming you mean further upstream in the sensory pathways.</p>
<p>On this timeframe, it's mostly sensory adaptation. Which is physiological. The receptor cells essentially get fatigued and don't respond as strongly to a second stimulus.</p>
<p>On a longer timeframe, it would be more psychological. For example, if you eat a lot of salty food for a few weeks, you would habituate to salt. So a salty stimulus would not taste as salty as before your salt binge. I'm not sure you could rule out some contribution from sensory adaptation in this case though. There could well be longer term changes at the receptor level too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe the answer is biochemical. </p>
<p>This is not my field of expertise, but this question brings me right back to graduate biochemistry and g-protein coupled receptors. GPCR signaling pathways are important for taste and smell. There are mechanisms to prevent runaway signaling, which is why after tasting or smelling something strong, it can be hard to taste or smell more subtle flavors or odors for a short while. </p>
<p>I found a nice summary here:
<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2018.01673/full" target="_blank">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2018.01673/full</a></p>
<p>&quot;The ability of an organism to sense and respond to its environment is critical to its survival. Indeed, the capacity to see, hear, smell, taste, or feel has been intrinsically tied to the evolution of all organisms, from the more nuanced responses of single cell migration along chemical gradients, to translation of light signals into visual images of the world around us. These functions are performed by receptors that are activated by diverse chemicals, a wide variety of mechanical stimuli, and light. Most of these receptors belong to a family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that transduce signals from outside of the cell/organism to stimulate signaling processes within the cell. These signaling pathways lead to responses such as changes in electrical activity, motion, and other physiologic functions. The responses are initiated when specific agonists bind to the receptor, causing a conformational change in the seven-transmembrane structure that is followed by G-protein coupling or decoupling. Ultimately this leads to activation of enzymes or channels resulting in secondary messenger production. To prevent runaway signaling, mechanisms have evolved to halt or dampen the process. These mechanisms include G-protein receptor kinases (GRKs) that phosphorylate the carboxyl tail of the receptor, bind arrestins, and promote uncoupling of the receptor, thereby putting a break on its function. Thus, a sophisticated process has evolved that allows an organism to alter its function in response to external stimuli.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the receptors in the mouth measure from an ever changing baseline. Actually, a lot of the receptors in the entire body function this way. An influx of sweet causes the taste receptors to become desensitized to sweet in the short term. Essentially, they set their new baseline higher and it takes an even greater concentration of sweetness for the receptor to fire. This can happen on a longer time scale, to, though the mechanism is a little different and has more to do with <em>neural</em> firing rather than <em>receptor</em> firing. That's your physiological/psychological difference, although it's not nearly as different as you might think.</p>
<p>It's really similar to what happens when you walk outside from a dark room. Bam! The light hurts your eyes. In a few seconds, you can see normally - you've become desensitized to that amount of light and it will take much more to achieve the same pain. The same is true for tactile senses, too. The pressure your socks exert on your feet is certainly enough to feel but you stop being aware of it after a few seconds of wearing socks.</p>
<p>In general, our senses are much better at measuring changes in states rather than exact amounts.</p>
<p>There's also a huge feedback loop between physiological and psychological processes, so it's hard to say one exists without the other. Yes, the short timescale is <em>more</em> physiologically dependent but you can push around the amount with different expectations and how you're directing attention.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

He would cut you a fresh slice of grapefruit to taste and then cut a fresh slice of orange. One year his son was helping him and gave them to me in the opposite order. He made a comment about doing it in reverse. I realized how they were able to sell so much fruit all those years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

A dessert should always be paired with a wine as sweet or sweeter than the dessert itself. If not, the wine will fall flat on the palate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
