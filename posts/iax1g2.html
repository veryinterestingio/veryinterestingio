		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A quick abbreviation explanation, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_meridional_overturning_circulation" target="_blank">AMOC</a>, or the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, is a key part of the global thermohaline circulation of the ocean. As highlighted in this review of the AMOC by <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015RG000493" target="_blank">Buckley &amp; Marshall, 2015</a>, it serves an important function in regulating a variety of aspects of climate, chief among them bringing warm waters poleward which is important for keeping the climate of northern Europe relatively temperate (among other things). During past deglaciations, the AMOC appears to destabilize / shut down (e.g. <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016GL069846" target="_blank">Galbraith et al, 2016</a>), at least in part driven by changes in salinity driven by increased flux of fresh water into the northern oceans via melting of glaciers/ice sheets. There is understandably concern that continued warming, driven by climate change, could destabilize AMOC, and there have been some indications that it is weakening (e.g. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0007-4?amp%3Bcode=7f36b424-9bbb-4925-82b9-9027a48165b8" target="_blank">Thornalley et al, 2018</a>), though importantly, exactly why it is weakening or if it's more of a cyclical change in strength as opposed to an imminent collapse is unclear. Generally, the potential for major collapse of the AMOC soon is controversial, but there are definitely papers out there arguing for this as a real (and scary) consequence of continued warming (e.g. <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/1/e1601666" target="_blank">Liu et al, 2017</a>). That being said a recent pretty comprehensive review by <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019JC015083" target="_blank">Weijer et al, 2019</a>, argues that we currently do not understand enough of the dynamics of the AMOC, or at least what the thresholds necessary for its collapse are, to say with certainty whether we are near a major disruption of AMOC. </p>
<p>In short, while the increasingly rapid melting of the Greenland ice sheet is certainly not good news, the extent to which this will destabilize AMOC in the near future seems uncertain. Obvious caveat being that ocean circulation is not my specialty so I will happily defer to other panelists with more relevant experience, maybe someone like /u/agate_?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alright. I assume the &quot;past the point of no return means a lot of Greenland's ice that is supported by land will now end up in the sea. Since the ice is composed of fresh water, it will dilute the salt water, change the density, and disrupt the current that sinks when it get up there.</p>
<p>But how does adding fresh water to salt water increase acidification?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The concern is that a &quot;lens&quot; of fresh water (from the melted ice) will form above the salty seawater. (Fresh water is less dense than salt, and this layering is a well-known phenomenon observed in many contexts. The layer dividing the water bodies is called a halocline and can be seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHn80f3lAUs" target="_blank">here.</a>)</p>
<p>If that happens, when that fresh water freezes, it won't act like seawater does. When seawater freezes, it forms pockets of extremely concentrated salty brine. The brine can stay liquid at very cold temperatures, and will gradually melt its way down through the ice. Sometimes the brine does <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bJ9QeQXnjc" target="_blank">this.</a> As it continues to sink to the sea floor (due to its very high relative density), the brine entrains more water, which causes a net strong downward current in the North Atlantic as a whole.</p>
<p>This is theorized that this downward current is the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Thermohaline_Circulation_2.png" target="_blank">&quot;pump&quot;</a> that drives much ocean water circulation worldwide, so if it were to be shut off, global atmospheric heat transport will change profoundly, leading to significant knock-on effects on climate at global to regional scales.</p>
<p>For instance, Ireland probably wouldn't have the <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/palm-trees-in-ireland-36548780/" target="_blank">palm trees</a> that it does if the Gulf Stream didn't bring all that heat energy up from the Carribean. Northern Europe can paradoxically expect to see temperatures <em>drop</em> as that heat pump is shut down. Similarly, the Caribbean's waters would warm, which would be expected to lead to more frequent and powerful hurricanes. There is also evidence showing climactic effects in far-removed parts of the world (the Arab Peninsula, the Indian Ocean) that coincide with evidence for former such events, suggesting that it is indeed the global climate that will be strongly affected by this kind of change.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say that humanity is having measurable effects on Earth systems that are observable at global scales, and if we don't start taking it incredibly seriously, right now, people will wish we had.</p>
