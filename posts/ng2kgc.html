<p>A person may feel a bit less intoxicated if in a serious and/or life threatening situation because of adrenaline or similar hormones, but they are still intoxicated. </p>
<p>They will still be suffering from the effects of intoxication. The only way to actually “become sober” after consuming a large amount of alcohol is to allow enough time to pass for your body to process it, which is a few hours at the minimum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, being intoxicated is also partly psychological. I don't remember the number (and the exact number is probably bullshit) but in college a course I took said a certain percentage of the effect of alcohol is not due to the substance itself but from the social situation you are drinking in and also your own expectations of alcohol.  So when something very serious happens, these feelings go away.  </p>
<p>And I think that's obvious, we all know people who behave differently when drunk.  A lot of what we perceive as intoxication is an interaction between the substance and our own mindset.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Adrenaline makes you <em>feel</em> awake and alert. This gives the illusion that you have &quot;sobered up&quot; because your body is using these things as a gauge of drunkenness.</p>
<p>However, the effects of alcohol are still fully present.</p>
<p>This is actually one of the dangers of mixing stimulants and alcohol - rather than directly counteracting each other, they actually both affect you simultaneously. So you end up both stimulated and drunk, which is not a good combination.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>People colloquially say &quot;it was sobering&quot; but that just means the fun ended - not that the influence of drugs has suddenly worn off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
