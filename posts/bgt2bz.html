<p>This was the top answer.</p>
<p>By MrPaleontologist • 4y</p>
<p>&quot;Here's an explanation I learned in an animal behavior course - it's called a redirected attack. Animals do it, just like us. Basically, when we get angry at another person, we have the urge to attack them in some way. But for a variety of reasons (including that attacks are energetically costly and that actual attacks can shatter social bonds) it's actually more adaptive to redirect the attack at some other object. Thus, if I get furious at you, I'll most likely slam my hand on the table or smash something instead of punching you in the jaw and smashing your skull.</p>
<p>Gulls have been observed to do this in territorial disputes. Instead of attacking each other, they usually will violently pull grass out of the ground in a manner similar to how they behave if in a physical confrontation.&quot; </p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s a few explanations, but the one that I understand the most is ‘emotional regulation’. It recognizes that it is usually not anger alone that someone is feeling. There is sadness, hurt, vulnerability, disrespect etc which can make the individual feel as if they have lost control over a situation. To gain that control back they may break things, physically hurt people or destroy other items. They basically Hulk to avoid feeling the hurt/disrespect/vulnerability.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
