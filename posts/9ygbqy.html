		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The human circadian rhythm is a little over 24 hours.  At night, we have signals in the brain that make us sleepy; blue light can screw up the release of melatonin. Things like testosterone and cortisol follow this diurnal rhythm.</p>
<p>Sometimes people are forced into abnormal sleep schedules, either by work (shift work) or because they want to stay up playing video games (social jetlag). Military personnel on submarines used to have to stay up for 6 hour shifts and have 12 hours off, to make an 18 hour day.  However, that really negatively affected their sleep schedules and quality of life.  They have switched it to 24 hour work days (8 on, 16 off) and quality of life has improved, as well as mission execution and alertness. People weren't nodding off anymore.   <a href="https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2016/10/28/this-life-changing-shift-has-made-submariners-much-happier/" target="_blank">https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2016/10/28/this-life-changing-shift-has-made-submariners-much-happier/</a></p>
<p>Circadian misalignment, ie sleeping at 2am to 10am every night instead of 11pm to 7am, has been shown to have a lot of negative effects on the body.  Shift workers who work at night have higher rates of heart attacks (possibly from inflammation), diabetes and obesity (changes to appetite hormones and cortisol and metabolism are all possibilities), psychiatric issues, and other things.  This is a pretty big field of research   <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4677771/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4677771/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;sleeping is thought to help clear out toxins that accumulate in the brain throughout normal daily activities. Beta-amyloid is a protein associated with Alzheimer’s disease is an example of one such toxin. During sleep, channels in the brain expand to allow the flow of cerebrospinal fluid to clear the debris, known as the glymphatic system, due to the similarity to the lymphatic system.&quot;</p>

<p>They dive into the different stages of sleep and why they’re all equally important. Your brain is deprived of Deep REM sleep so, you may need more than the normal 7-8 hours for your brain to make up for the lost cycles, but the quality of those resting hours matters in figuring out how much more. </p>
<p>Check out the podcast! The professor can explain this way better than we can. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
