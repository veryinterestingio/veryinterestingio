		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most other vaccine types, especially the inactivated virus/bacteria or subunit vaccines require the co-administration of an adjuvant to elicit a good immune response leading to immunity. Vector vaccines, to my knowledge, also contain an &quot;adjuvant&quot; in the form of the actual virus used to deliver the DNA to cells. mRNA vaccines do not seem to require an adjuvant, and in fact the most successful mRNA vaccines have modifications on the RNA portion to <em>reduce</em> immunogenicity. Why is this? Do the RNA and lipids used in the vaccine have properties that somehow allow the immune system to decisively react to them, or their translation products, as &quot;foreign&quot; antigens?</p>
<p>ETA: I understand how general immunology and innate immunity works (I have been an MSc. structural biologist for ~10 years) with regards to MHC and TLR pathways, but I don't understand the molecular mechanism of <em>why</em> our immune systems seem to respond so effectively to 'intercellular' pathogens (eg. extracellularly expressed antigen subunits) as opposed to 'intracellular' antigens like protein/ protein subunits from vaccines without an adjuvant (although we do not seem to have this 'problem' during natural bacterial or fungal infections, presumably due to the abundance of immunogenic molecules present in bacterial cell membrane lipids etc)</p></div></div>

<p>There are so-called RNA sensors which are tightly regulated to prevent sensing of self-RNA.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The human body is very antagonistic to free-floating mRNA because that's normally a sign of a viral infection. Viruses hijack a cell's machinery to make lots of copies of itself, and then causes the cell to burst and release all the viruses and mRNA. The current mRNA vaccines modify the mRNA to make them more effective in making proteins but that also reduces its adjuvant effects. The net result is that the makers can select how much adjuvant properties they want from the mRNA vaccines. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLR7 and TLR8 are intracellular virus ssRNA sensor protein existing mainly in dendritic cells and macrophages as well as low levels in epithelial and keratinocytes. When the lipid nanoparticle of mRNA are imported into these cell from the intramuscular injection, they collide with inner membrane localized TLR endosomes and trigger activation of innate immunity pathways leading to recruitment of more macrophages and dendritic cells to create more effective antigen recovery and presentation and promoting translocation of these antigen presenters to the lymph node. Many mRNA nanolipids particles get past these TLR endosomes and are picked up and transcribed by cellular ribosome complexes to create the spike proteins. These spike proteins are mounted onto vesicular MHC proteins and are then presented on the membrane to adaptive immune cells. This adjuvant nature of mRNA tech is something that has been looked at very carefully since the beginning, with researchers having to lower the dosage greatly from the original treatment due to over stimulation of this innate immunity leading to death in animal models. Too much innate immune response leaves too large of a signal to recruit innate immune pro inflammatory cells like neutrophils, which could lead to and over abundance of cytokines that leads to highly increased endothelial leakage and ultimately death.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reading your responses, it appears that you're looking at &quot;response&quot; as a snapshot of binding/not binding.  </p>
<p>(Successful) MHC presentation (CD4 more so than CD8) requires complex cellular signaling, activity, and specialization in order to drive the immune response forward, and it can fail at multiple steps in the process.  The mere presence of a perceived foreign peptide may initiate a response, but just as likely, may not, in which case the adjuvant is there to &quot;prime&quot; the environment for a response.  </p>
<p>A mRNA vaccine could get around this, as it banks more on the CD8/MHC1 pathway rather than the CD4/MHC2 pathway, the former being more readily &quot;holstered&quot; to fire than the latter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
