		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In situations like this it is important to be clear about the difference between adaptation in the evolutionary sense and individual responses to environmental changes.  <a href="https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_31" target="_blank">Adaptation in the scientific sense</a> involves the appearance and spread of a heritable trait that is useful in a particular environment over a period of multiple generations.  However, individual organisms also obviously have the capacity to respond to changing environments to some degree, which we call <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Phenotypic_Plasticity_Genotypes_to_Phenotypes.jpg" target="_blank">phenotypic plasticity</a>.  The distinction between these two can be confusing, since phenotypic plasticity itself can evolve too (i.e., selection can favour the <em>capacity</em> to tolerate a wider range of environments rather than adaptations to a particular environment).  Unsurprisingly, this kind of thing is most commonly expected in organisms that live in highly variable and heterogeneous environments, though the dynamics can get very complicated (e.g., <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/evl3.100" target="_blank">see King and Hadfield 2019</a>).</p>
<p>The point of this, to bring the discussion back to earthworms, is that even if we do see worms apparently responding in different ways to different types of waste, it's hard to know for sure without careful study whether this is due to actual evolution or phenotypic plasticity.  One way to prove that evolution has actually happened, would be to do something like a <a href="http://www.ecoevolab.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Exp-design.jpg" target="_blank">reciprocal transplant experiment</a>.  Take worms from environment A and worms from environment B, and measure their success in both environments (after giving them sufficient time to get used to their surroundings, perhaps over a few generations).  If both worms are able to do just as well in both environments, then they are likely just phenotypically plastic.  But if A worms do better in environment A, and B worms do better in environment B, then this implies that they have in fact experienced evolutionary changes in response to their environments.</p>
<p>An interesting study of this sort was done by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5680423/" target="_blank">Dutilleul et al. 2017</a> in nematodes (which despite often being called worms, are not related to earthworms at all really).  They tested the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Morgan_Dutilleul/publication/324683200/figure/fig11/AS:618034297311236@1524362267032/Reciprocal-transplant-experiment-design-and-potential-responses-In-A-Schematic.png" target="_blank">response of nematodes to different environments</a> featuring high levels of uranium, salt, or both based on different environmental backgrounds (note: that figure is actually from a different paper by the same authors, but it demonstrates the general principle well enough).  I can't really find much work on earthworms in the context of composting specifically, but there has been some research on responses to pollutants, especially heavy metal pollution of the sort that is commonly found near mines.  For example, <a href="https://nerc.ukri.org/planetearth/stories/761/" target="_blank">this article</a> describes the work of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0038071710002026" target="_blank">Andre et al. 2010</a> in studying earthworm responses to lead and zinc.  While they didn't do a reciprocal transplant experiment exactly, the researchers here did find clear differences in how worms deal with metal based on their environment of origin.  Earthworms from contaminated sites were able to tolerate much higher levels of metal ions, and also seem to have developed an improved ability to sequester metals within specific organelles in their cells to prevent damage.  This was also corroborated by the detection of significant genetic differences between worms from the different environments.  Altogether, this implies that these worms have indeed experienced actual evolution in response to metal pollution, rather than just plastic responses, though I'm not sure how many generations these changes might have taken.</p>
<p>So to wrap up, it's definitely feasible that earthworms could show evolutionary adaptations to differing environments (e.g., large amounts of coffee grounds), but it's not guaranteed either.  If you're only exposing them to types of waste that they already have the capacity to deal with, it's likely they will just respond through individual plastic changes rather than evolution per se.  I suppose if you keep them in a specific constant environment for long enough, they might actually lose some of their ability to survive well in <em>other</em> environments, but I suspect this might require a longer time frame than 100 generations to become noticeable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think we can talk in terms of psychology when it comes to earthworms. Psychology is the study of the human mind. Plus, there are no higher brain functions in earthworms, no self awareness, nothing we can really call a &quot;mind&quot;.  Behavioral changes are the only thing anyone will be able to speak to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
