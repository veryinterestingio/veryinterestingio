		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two types of regular (AA for example) batteries.</p>
<p>Non rechargeable batteries have two chemicals that send energy from one to another through a device.  Once all the energy has moved from one end to the other or been used by the device, the battery is dead and must be disposed of.</p>
<p>Rechargeable batteries have two different chemicals.  When plugged in to a battery-operated device, they work the same way as a non-rechargeable battery.  But when plugged into a device with something else on it providing the energy, like your wall power outlet, the energy can be pushed backward and refill energy in the first chemical.  </p>
<p>When you try to recharge a non-rechargeable battery, the energy isn't moved back, and instead turns into heat.  This makes the chemicals really hot, until they explode out of the battery and make a really dangerous mess.  That's why you shouldn't try to recharge non-rechargeable batteries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Batteries are just a chemical reaction happening. Specificly an REDuction/OXidation reaction (Redox), which involves the exchange of charge, ie electrons.  Thru clever design and an intermediary we can make the electrions travel down a path we choose, namy thru our electornic devices.   So they are not &quot;charged&quot; in the first place.  They are built with a charge in them.</p>
<p>How they are recharged is you apply a reverse voltage to the battery.  This drives the reaction in reverse causing the chemicals to go back to their initial state.  This process is not perfect, which is why batteries get less and less powerful as they charge and discharge.</p>
<p>&quot;Non&quot;-rechargeable batteries can't be properly charged as the chemical reaction doesn't reverse properly when the reverse charge is applied.  So the chemicals do NOT go back to their starting state.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Batteries have 2 different substances in them. One  is slightly more attractive to electrons than the other. When those 2 substances are attached to each other via a circuit that attractive force causes electrons to flow. When you charge a battery the more electro attractive substance is made less electro attractive and the process is reversed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When it comes to rechargeable batteries, not all batteries are created equal. NiCd batteries were among the first widely available secondary cells, but they suffered from an inconvenient problem known as theÂ memory effect. Basically, if these batteries weren't fully discharged every time they were used, they would quickly lose capacity. NiCd batteries were largely phased out in favor of NiMH batteries. These secondary cells boast a higher capacity and are only minimally affected by the memory effect, but they don't have a very good shelf life. Like NiMH batteries, LiOn batteries have a long life, but they hold a charge better, operate at higher voltages, and come in a much smaller and lighter package. Essentially all high-quality portable technology manufactured these days takes advantage of this technology. However, LiOn batteries are not currently available in standard sizes such as AAA, AA, C or D, and they're considerably more expensive than their older counterparts.</p>
<p>With NiCd and NiMH batteries, charging can be tricky. You must be careful not to overcharge them, as this could lead to decreased capacity. To prevent this from happening, some chargers switch to a trickle charge or simply shut off when charging is complete. NiCd and NiMH batteries also must be reconditioned, meaning you should completely discharge and recharge them again every once in a while to minimize any loss in capacity. LiOn batteries, on the other hand, have sophisticated chargers that prevent overcharging and never need to be reconditioned.</p>
<p>Even rechargeable batteries will eventually die, though it may take hundreds of charges before that happens. When they finally do give out, be sure to dispose of them at a recycling facility.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
