		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Is the ocean getting less salty?</strong> Melting land-based glaciers and ice sheets are adding fresh water to the oceans (which would tend to decrease salinity as you hypothesize) but this is not the only effect of climate change. For example, increasing air temperatures mean that on average more evaporation is happening, so in some locations, increased evaporation can drive increases in sea surface salinity. Similarly, changes in precipitation patterns, both over the ocean and on land which in turn is translate into river discharge, mean that some areas of the ocean are experiencing increased fresh water input (decreasing salinity) while others experience decreased fresh water input (increasing salinity). Other oceanographic changes (e.g., changes to large scale currents, etc) can also influence salinity both on seasonal and longer term timescales. Thus, if we look at estimates of salinity changes by different ocean basins (e.g., Figure 5 of <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/33/23/jcliD200366.xml" target="_blank">Cheng et al., 2020</a>) we can find some where surface salinity is decreasing on average (e.g., Pacific, Southern, and Southern Indian) and others were salinity is increasing on average (e.g., the Atlantic and Northern Indian). Putting that all together, on a global scale this leads to a pattern where surface salinity was decreasing between 1960-2000, but has been increasing since 2000. However, even within those ocean basins, there is variability, for example in Figure 6 of that same paper showing maps of changes in salinity, you can see that much of the salinity is increasing in the majority of the Atlantic, but decreasing in the northern and southern Atlantic.</p>
<p>Considering these in the context of climate change reveals some obvious connections and other more subtle influences (that still may be related to climate change). For example, there is decent evidence that the freshening of the Southern Ocean is driven by changes in freshwater influx from increased northward transport and melting of sea ice (e.g., <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature19101" target="_blank">Haumann et al., 2016</a>). For the Atlantic, things are more complicated where some of the increased salinity is attributed to outflow of increasing saline Mediterranean waters (e.g., <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00382-014-2131-7.pdf" target="_blank">Skilris et al., 2014</a>) or changes in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o%E2%80%93Southern_Oscillation" target="_blank">ENSO</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic_oscillation" target="_blank">NAO</a> (e.g., <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661107000821" target="_blank">Reverdin et al., 2007</a>). That last point highlights another challenge in that salinity of oceans vary seasonally and on multi-year timescales (through changes in things like ENSO) even in the absence of climate change, so one must always be careful in thinking about attributing a change in something like salinity specifically to climate change (and things get more complicated as we consider the effect of climate change on multi-year cycles like ENSO, etc). Also very important to consider, the patterns I've discussed above are for the surface (top 2000 meters) and are the average patterns, but looking at Figure 6 of Cheng highlights that those averages can reflect a lot of diversity, e.g., localized pockets of increasing / decreasing salinity and different patterns between the top few hundred meters and deeper levels, etc. On that last point, it's been argued that one of the hallmarks of climate change and a warming ocean is increased stratification, i.e., increased contrast in salinity between the surface and deeper layers (e.g., <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/336/6080/455.abstract" target="_blank">Durack et al., 2012</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Are the changes in salinity related to climate change?</strong> Taking all of the above into account, it becomes clear we need to consider salinity changes regionally and think about changes at different levels of the ocean. If we try to boil this down though and assess how much of the observed changes (whether those changes reflect an increase or a decrease in salinity) are related to climate change, Cheng provides a nice summary. Basically, comparing the expected sea surface salinities of a global climate model forced by observations (i.e., one that includes the anthropogenic contributions) and runs of the same model where this anthropogenic contributions are removed reveals that the observed salinity changes are reproduced in the anthropogenic model, but not in the natural model. This suggests that much of the observed salinity changes are related to anthropogenic climate change, though many nuances remain.</p>
<p><strong>What effect does that have?</strong> For this, we need to step back and consider some vary basic oceanography, specifically that the major ocean currents that exchange shallow and deep water are driven by both temperature and salinity, i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermohaline_circulation" target="_blank">Thermohaline circulation</a>. This also means that it's a bit tricky to disentangle changes in ocean temperatures and salinity in terms of potential effects (though in some cases we can). Ocean warming is usually discussed as kind of the primary forcing on resulting changes in currents and/or water cycle, with changes in salinity being related, but more used to track some of these changes in the water cycle (e.g., <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aace42/meta" target="_blank">Zika et al., 2018</a>). </p>
<p>That being said, it's been argued that major changes in surface salinity can influence some of these major ocean currents, e.g., decreasing salinity in the North Atlantic may weaken <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_meridional_overturning_circulation" target="_blank">AMOC</a> (e.g., <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00382-014-2395-y.pdf" target="_blank">Huang et al., 2015</a>), and in another feedback, slowdown of AMOC has been attributed to exacerbating increasing salinity in the Central Atlantic (e.g., <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0897-7" target="_blank">Zhu &amp; Liu, 2020</a>). There has been a lot of concern with regards to whether this increased freshening could substantially slow or fully collapse the AMOC, which would have a variety of pretty large regional to global climate implications, none of them particularly pleasant (e.g., <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms6752?hc_location=ufi" target="_blank">Boulton et al., 2014</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-015-2540-2" target="_blank">Jackson et al., 2015</a>, <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/1/e1601666.short" target="_blank">Liu et al., 2017</a>). However, the extent to which the AMOC might fully collapse, the magnitude of the effects of slowdown vs collapse of the AMOC, and the timescales of slowdown or recoveries of the AMOC are all things that are still a topic of a lot of discussion (e.g., <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018GL080442" target="_blank">Thomas &amp; Federov, 2019</a>, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018GL078104" target="_blank">Jackson &amp; Wood, 2018</a>, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016GL070457" target="_blank">Bakker et al., 2016</a>). This is just one example of the changes in salinity might have, but it's one of the ones that also receives a decent amount of attention. I'm sure more oceanographic focused panelists/users could add more to this and other aspects of this answer.</p>
<p><strong>In short,</strong> climate change has complicated impacts on ocean salinity leading to both increases and decreases depending on location. These changes in salinity can have serious implications, which along with changes in ocean temperature, etc, can feedback into additional changes in climate at the regional to global scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The ocean's volume is approximately 1.35x10^9 km^3. Its area is 361x10^6 km^2. </p>
<p>If you were to increase the ocean's level by 4 metres, say, you would be adding 4/1000km x 361x10^6 km^2 = 1.444x10^6 km^3. So you increased the volume of the ocean by </p>
<p>1.444x10^6 km^3/ 1.35x10^9km^3 = 0.001. </p>
<p>So, not considering other factors,  the salinity would roughly decrease by 0.1% i.e., 1/1000.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is yes. Read up on the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation(AMOC), which is the current that circulates warm and cold water through the North Atlantic, and is responsible for warming Northern Europe. This circulation relies on salinity contents, and if more fresh water is added it can dilute the salinity content which can change the way warm water circulates along the coast of Europe, which in turn can affect temperatures. It’s basically what “the day after tomorrow” was about, except for the timeline would be much much slower than depicted in the movie.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
