		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because outside you have multiple things that affects the way the temperature feels. A slight breeze or moment in the shade will feel cooler. Humidity or the sun shining on you will make it feel warmer. Inside you don’t feel these variables nearly as often.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you're inside and have things at what you think is a comfortable temperature, you're normally not wearing very many clothes, usually aren't very active, and there usually isn't much air moving around. So your body becomes used to a very small temperature range and you really notice it when it drifts outside of that small range. This awareness of change gets boosted by your home being your almost-entirely-controllable &quot;area of comfort&quot; where you learn to expect a lot of control over the temperature you're in.</p>
<p>When you go outside, often you have a lot more clothes on and are moving around in a much more active way, and the temperature has a tendency to shift up and down. So between the extra insulation you're wearing that protects you from temperature change, the &quot;wind chill factor&quot; that contributes to robbing your body of heat or adding more heat to it when it's really hot out, and your own activity level generating and removing heat from your body, you don't really notice a few degrees of change as much. And because it's not entirely under your control, you get used to not really controlling it and so become a little less aware of how it changes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In order to be efficient the thermostat actually has an upper and lower temperature threshold for when it turns on and shuts off. When you raise the temperature 3 degrees, you're actually shifting those threshholds up by 3 degrees.</p>
<p>So lets so you set the temperature to 70 degrees. Hypothetically your thermostat turns on as soon as the temperature gets to 68, and runs until it gets to 72. These 5 degrees in total, constitute it's range. When you change it to 73 degrees, your new range is 71-75. So on average it should be 3 degrees warmer, but you will get differences of up to 5 degrees warmer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of it is the temperature of the air coming out of the vents. When cooling, that air will be around 55°F; when heating it's around 80°F. This is so that the unit doesn't have to constantly run to get your home to the desired temperature</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
