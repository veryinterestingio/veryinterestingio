		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a dumb question at all. After all, putting your hands on $2 trillion sounds a little crazy.</p>
<p>The answer, however, is pretty simple: debt. Just like someone buying on credit cards, governments usually spend more cash than they have available. However, unlike your average person with a huge credit card bill, countries operate under somewhat different rules.</p>
<p>A nation's debt (called <em>sovereign debt</em>) is held by a variety of entities. The public holds about a third of it in the form of bonds and similar debt instruments. (When you buy a savings bond, you're buying a little bit of national debt!) Another nearly third is held by foreign entities like governments and investment firms. About 10% is held by the Federal Reserve. And about a quarter is held by the government itself. </p>
<p>Simply printing money is <em>incredibly</em> dangerous for an economy. It sounds like a solid idea - we need more money, so just print it! - but it can destabilize and even completely crash an economy through <em>inflation</em>. Basically, you can think of a nation's currency as having a (relatively) fixed value. That value is divided up by the number of units (dollars, pounds, etc.) in circulation. Simply printing more dollars makes each individual dollar less valuable since you haven't increased the total value. In 2007, Zimbabwe took the &quot;print more money&quot; approach to solving an economic problem - by 2009, the Zimbabwean dollar had devalued so badly that one US dollar was equivalent to over two <em>billion</em> Zimbabwean dollars. </p>
<p>The safest, simplest solution for a government, therefore, is to just add to the debt. Basically, the US will ring up another $2 trillion on a credit card that already has a $21 trillion balance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eventually it will come in some form of taxes. But for this round it is likely to be a combination of bonds (or more generally Treasury Securities) and (more or less) creating money through quantitative easing (QE). </p>
<p>1) Treasury securities. The government essentially borrows money. Those people with cash and don't want to put all their money in real estate or equity or corporate bonds will also be willing to lend the government money ie purchase notes and bonds. </p>
<p>2) QE. The Fed (central bank) will certain assets (financial instruments like mortgage backed securities and, in some cases, shares) in exchange for cash. </p>
<p>3) The other method to inject liquidity is for the Fed to lend cash to banks and certain companies in exchange for certain collateral. This is, in effect, the opposite of borrowing by issuing bonds. The companies usually have to use very high quality but illiquid assets such as long term mortgages etc as collateral for the loans. </p>
<p>Method 2 and 3 are essentially &quot;creating money&quot; because the Fed simply credits the accounts of the participating companies with the sum lent or purchased. Because the Fed doesn't have any constraints like reserve requirements etc - it can, in theory, do this indefinitely. Of course it doesn't do so because the main job of the Fed is to manage inflation and creating too much money results in inflation.</p>
<p>In the current situation, where there is loss of confidence in the economy and a fairly big slump in demand and general lack of liquidity - there is almost no fear of inflation but rather the &quot;opposite&quot; - deflation and recession. These are much more damaging to people's lives and the economy and risking some long term inflation in the future is much more preferable than a present recession/depression.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s not a dumb question. The U.S., like other sovereign nations, issues currency - the U.S. dollar - that is essentially a promise to pay its bills. It can print as much currency as it wants, as long as people still believe its promises. Over history, the U.S. has earned great credibility as a safe, reliable borrower, and borrowers, bankers, and investors around the world have believed in us. So ... they continue to invest in our markets, buy our bonds, and otherwise support our often spendthrift ways. So ... to answer your question directly, the government essentially “prints” the money ... not on paper, but that’s another story for another night. Sleep tight!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
