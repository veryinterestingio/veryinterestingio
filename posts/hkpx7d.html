He’ll start working on them, then the orchestra will have 2-4 rehearsals before performances start. Everyone needs to take copious notes, because the conductor will put his own spin on things: “Violins, play louder at 85. Trombones, slow down at 157.”</p>
<p>Then they perform twice, he gets a week off, and another 4 pieces of new sheet music arrive in the mail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nearly all professional-level classical musicians can sight read. They often play a wide range of music, sometimes of considerable complexity, without the benefit of much rehearsal. They usually &quot;know&quot; the piece, but not necessarily note-for-note. And classical players are expected to play very, very accurately. So reading the score allows them to play music without committing all of it to memory. Some classical players do play some pieces from memory, however.  Soloists playing concertos, for example, often play from memory. </p>
<p>Jazz players often do read during performance. If you're playing standards by request, for example, you can rely on a fake book for the changes and head, which are basically an outline of the song, giving you a structure to improvise a part. Rock is usually simpler, more repetitious, and looser than classical. The chords and riffs might be all you need to know. And rock musicians often can't read in any case.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Speaking as a former orchestral trumpet player - here are a few points:</p>
<p>1) Counting goddamn rests - you barely play until the glory shot.  Until then - it’s a virtual art form to keep track of where the fuck you are.<br />
2) Transposition:  most orchestral pieces are written in whatever key the composer wrote them - however for fixed key instruments this often means transposition.  Most often done by sight.  Now - i guess you could memorize this too, but the added layer of complexity is such that it’s a nice backstop to have the page in front of you
3) Notes - often a ton of cumulative chicken scratch reminding you of specific cues and notes from months of rehearsals</p>
<p>Hope that contributes to the discussion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rock bands etc. only play their own music, and the same songs over and over and over again for the most part. So not only did they probably help write the song, they've played it thousands of times and know it by heart. Plus, unless we're talking 70s Yes here, the songs aren't 20 minutes long where you can easily get lost. Plus, how your part fits in with the other 4-5 members of your band is easier to keep in your head. </p>
<p>A professional orchestra musician however typically has to deal with several 20 minute pieces, in conjunction with up to 100 other musicians and a conductor, and they most likely do NOT know the piece by heart. I mean yeah, after a while there are some pieces that you will learn by heart. Julia Fischer, German violinist probably knows Vivaldi's Four Seasons by now, its one of her signature pieces... and every cellist probably knows <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIge2mYdTtM" target="_blank">Bach's G major prelude</a> (doesn't hurt that its short).... but you have to play 3-4 long pieces every concert and the setlist changes every few weeks so...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
