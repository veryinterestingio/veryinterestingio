		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how they died.  I'm cobbling this together from a forensics minor and nursing school (I'm not an ME or anything so this could definitely be more accurate), but you tend to look at things like organs and what major arteries might have been compromised.  It's unlikely that a gunshot wound (GSW) in a leg is the one that killed somebody if they have 5 with a few in the chest, but if it clipped the femoral artery and the other GSWs are in muscle/bone without compromising an artery or hitting an organ, and the person exsanguinated, that's it's the one in the leg that killed you, not the ones in the chest.  If you have a GSW in the leg and one through the heart, then you likely died when your heart stopped, not when you eventually bled out through the leg.</p>
<p>If you're asking how do you know if the person has multiple stab wounds that all punctured organs or arteries and you want to know which one killed someone, it's cumulative.  If you're losing blood from 6 areas, then it's all of them that killed you, not just one.  Your system can only lose so much blood before it goes into shock, so while one wound might have bled more than another, it's the cumulative effect that kills you.</p>
<p>If you have multiple different issues going on (say, you've been poisoned and stabbed and you have cancer), then your body can survive without some things longer than it can without others.  The nursing priority is airway-&gt; breathing -&gt; circulation because no air is going to kill you faster than pretty much anything else.  If the poison has paralyzed your lungs and you can't get air, then unless you're gushing blood at such a rate that you die before you run out of air, it's the poison that killed you, even though you have two other potentially fatal things going on.</p>
<p>So you look at the current state of the body (dead) and where the likely causes of death came from (Blue lips/extremeties?  Likely had an oxygen issue.  Extremely pale and riddled with holes?  Likely a bleeding issue, etc).  Once you have a list of possible causes, then you can work backwards to see what scenarios line up with existing evidence.</p>
<p>If all you have is a skeleton (which is what my thesis was on), you tend to look at hard tissue injuries and you can often see where, say, a knife or bullet grazed a rib on the way in, and you can track that angle to see if it's going towards the heart or lungs, or is near an artery.</p>
<p>I'm not sure that answers the question you were asking, but I hope it's helpful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not an exact science, but there are clues. In the case of multiple stab wounds, the medical examiner may say a few of them were potentially fatal. A stab wound would almost always cause death by bleeding, so if it didn't injure a major vessel or the heart, it wasn't the fatal wound. Where the blood is provides a clue. If someone had stab wounds in the carotid (neck) and aorta (chest and belly), but there's no blood in the belly, then that stab wound happened after death. Like any other doctor, they will have info about the circumstances as well. Witnesses or details from the crime scene might also provide a clue as to what happened.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the time it doesn't really matter.  If six people are all stabbing someone, they can all be guilty of murder, no matter which wound was actually fatal.</p>
<p>If it does matter (or just to learn more about wounds), they'll examine each wound, and the crime scene, to see the blood spatter patterns, how different wounds interact with each other, and whether each wound, on its own, could have been fatal.  Usually a fatal wound will bleed quite a lot, and later wounds will bleed less, because blood pressure will be lower.  For example, if someone was stabbed in the heart and also had his throat slit, blood on the ceiling would indicate that the throat was cut first, and that was the wound that killed him.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
