How did they manage to carry enough food and water (but especially water) to make those crossings?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You want to read The Kon Tiki Expedition by Thor Heyerdahl.   </p>
<p>Kon-Tiki carried 1,040 litres (275 US gal) of drinking water in 56 water cans, as well as a number of sealed bamboo rods. The purpose stated by Heyerdahl for carrying modern and ancient containers was to test the effectiveness of ancient water storage. For food Kon-Tiki carried 200 coconuts, sweet potatoes, bottle gourds and other assorted fruit and roots.   </p>
<p>And the answer in the book - the traditional containers and coconuts preserved liquid better than modern tins. The rafts themselves were plenty big enough to carry large quantities of food and water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>For reference, this is comparable or slightly longer than the Nina and Pinta.  </p>
<p>Polynesians stored water in gourds and bamboo segments, drank from coconuts, and captured rainwater.  In a pinch, fish and sea turtle blood is also drinkable.  </p>

<p>In fact, though, their voyages were actually more impressive because colonization voyages brought not only people and the food they needed, but also an entire agricultural suite, including a wide array of domesticated plants as well as pigs, dogs, and chickens.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They had some versions of their boats that were enormous. These could carry a lot. They commonly kept chickens on-board for eggs, and kept water in jars and other containers. They also did a lot of their early colonizing when sea levels were lower and there were more islands to go to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
