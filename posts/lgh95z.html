	<title>ELI5: Humans have spent countless years domesticating and selectively breeding crops in order to get the best possible produce, such as bananas and watermelons. So why is there still a giant ass pit in avocados even though basically every other crop is selectively bred for the best attributes?</title>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing to note that no one has mentioned is that all commercial Hass avacados are grafts from a tree from 1926. They aren’t grown from seeds,  they are clones, and clones of clones, so we can’t choose to plant the seeds from fruit that are smaller. (well we can, we just dont)</p>
<p>So the answer to your question is that we haven’t actually selectively bred hass avacados for the last 100 years.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is that it can take hundreds or even thousands of years of selective breeding to make a change like that naturally. With todays tech we can make that happen in a few years probably.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It takes time to breed plants for the traits you want, especially when avocado trees don't bear fruit for 5 to 13 years. That's a long time to wait. Avocados until recently had giant pits that took up most of the fruit. So the smaller pits we see now are a big advance on what they used to look like. Over time, the pits will get smaller and smaller and the edible part will get bigger and bigger. Sometimes you still get avocados in the store with ginormous pits, and other times with quite small pits. Check out this video that shows (near the end) wild avocados. Some are tiny like olives, others are larger but mostly pit, just a small layer of edible stuff. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUrB4EiJmhE" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUrB4EiJmhE" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUrB4EiJmhE</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As other people have mentioned, it takes time to be able to achieve the genetic modification you're after.</p>
<p>The history of the avocado is quite interesting and I suggest you look into it. In essence - the avocado is really old. It's from the time that the Earth was covered with megafauna and megaflora (large plants and animals). The avocado tree relies on big animals to eat it and pass on the pit away from the tree, someplace new. 13000 years ago around 60-80% of the megafauna went extinct and so did the chances of the avocado to survive.</p>
<p>Animals don't peel and eat just the fleshy part, they eat it whole and pass only the undigested pit. Not much animals were left capable of swallowing it whole and we can thank a select few for keeping it alive, at least until humans saw the potential and started growing it themselves.</p>
<p>It's part of mexican culture for at least 2000 years, but it didn't really come close until the 19th century where it gained popularity, and the first half or the 20th century when people started creating varieties and mass producing it.</p>
<p>But in the mind of the avocado pit it still relies on the big animals, so it may have been 200 years for us cultivating it, but it's gonna be hard for the avocado pit to get the memo that the thing it relied on for millennia to survive is no longer needed.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of interesting posts about the history of the avocado:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the #1 trait they breed for is matketability. Thats why the hass is standard in the us. Americans were willing to pay for the dark skin that hides damage during trasport and storage. Next are color, texture, and flavor. Size is one of the last. If you're interested, the California Cooperative Extension's avocado variety testing program documents from the 50s-70s are available online <a href="https://calisphere.org/collections/27013/?rq=Avocado%20" target="_blank">https://calisphere.org/collections/27013/?rq=Avocado%20</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Seedless avacados are not actually uncommon but are just small and are discarded by farmers typically. Due to the long time it takes seedlings to mature its difficult to breed new cultivars and most new varieties are accidental mutations. I buy pinkerton avacados and the seed to flesh ratio is great but it goes bad quickly off the tree and is bad for mass market. Hass avacadoes are the ones most people are familiar with I think. They produce a lot of fruits with seeds of varying size (but typically at least a third of the fruit is seed)and have a decent shelf life (for an avocado) I imagine the fruit is also resistant to mutations that affect seed size due to its evolutionary niche as food for megafauna which is why the pit is so large and the fruit so calorie dense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
