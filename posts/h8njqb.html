		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is the most relevant answer I've found. Not an expert but I can quote one lol</p>
<p>&quot;We talked with expert Dr. Dave Tilley, DPT, gymnastics coach, and founder of Shift Movement Science and Gymnastics Education, to better understand why it’s common to experience shaking in a deep stretch:</p>
<p><strong>There isn’t a ton of clear research or evidence in relation to shaking with flexibility, but most people agree that it tends to do with the muscles being forced to move or contract in larger than normal motions.</strong></p>
<p>'There is one line of thought that as a muscle and tendon or ligament get stretched to the perceived end range of motion, the nervous system tends to put the brakes on due to threat detection. It could be possible that the shaking is a protective mechanism to help prevent tissue damage.</p>
<p><strong>There is another line of thought that because the body isn’t used to those ranges of motion, the nervous system can’t control the muscle well and starts to freak out a bit.</strong></p>
<p>Again, lots of theory but based on some solid neuroscience on muscle function. The scientific term for the theory of muscles contracting when exposed to a wider than normal range of motion is called the myotatic reflex, or the 'stretch reflex'! The stretch reflex is a contraction triggered by stretching within the muscle. When the nerve activity of the targeted area increases, it puts into play “alpha motor neuron activity, causing the muscle fibers to contract and thus resist the stretching.1'”</p>

<p>Edit: so since some people are pointing out this is a bit over a layman's (or a 5 year old's) level of understanding. I'll just bold the relevant parts that even a 5 year old can understand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am having a hard time remembering the name, but this shaking is commonly used for muscle relaxation in a lot of dance and acting schools. </p>
<p>You basically find the point where your body starts to shake and you kinda “encourage” it to shake as much as possible. After a minute or two, you stop and relax. It’s a very helpful way to find deep relaxation in the body and better mind/body connection. </p>
<p>I will try to find the name of this technique. I’ve definitely used it in the past and it really helps in finding better alignment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While this post is on front page, can anyone explain why your legs will start spasming and continuously shaking when only the balls of the soles are on the ground and you’re leaning forward or crouching down? It’s hard to explain but it started happening a few years ago. When attempting to crouch to work on something or bending to pick something up, the legs will start shaking profusely, like the kind of shake you might do when you’re in a chair with your ankles lifted from the floor. It’s like an up and down motion with the entire leg while the toes stay down. Is it just muscle weakness from having not exercised for so long? Will it go away after working out?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
