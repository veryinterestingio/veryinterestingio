		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thirst and quenching your thirst aren't factors in hydration. Thirst is merely a sensation you get after you are dehydrated to encourage you to drink.</p>
<p>Your body measures your &quot;hydration” status by receptors in your brain. It comes down to how much water is in your blood (basically speaking). To be more accurate it is also measuring the salt in your blood because the amount of salt in your blood is a reflection of how much water will be in there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other explanations are super succinct but to satisfy any super curious eli5 subscribers here’s an extended version.</p>
<p>It comes down to blood pressure, really. Its hydration levels and salt content.
For hydration levels, you have receptors that can detect how much your blood vessels are stretched (called baroreceptors). They sit around a few different blood vessels (carotid artery, aorta and one in your kidneys) and can detect dilation. When your blood pressure is low (low dilation caused by excretion of water by sweat etc) it’s harder for your heart to pump blood in your body so they send information to your brain to stimulate your thirst reflex. Bing bang boom, you drink water, which goes into your blood stream and increases blood pressure.</p>
<p>Another instance is when you eat something salty or do heaps of exercise and loose A LOT of water and drastically increase salt concentration (or other methods, like just not drinking water). This comes back to blood pressure again. You also often swell up (noticeable around your knuckles) because the salt is spread out in all the cells around your body, the water comes out of your capillaries (very stretchy and hold most of your blood) and go into your cells to help balance out the concentration.  Your body (kidneys to be specific) can sense the change in blood volume. Your kidneys (incredibly efficient organs, and frankly mind blowing piece of machinery) then hold onto more water (by becoming less permeable to water and not allowing it to be excreted via urine, which is caused by the release of a hormone called antidiuretic hormone (thanks u/dietus for reminding me) (ADH, also known as vasopressin and also acts on your blood vessels causing them to constrict and raise blood pressure). The same process as before happens: blood pressure drops due to decrease in volume from water exiting your blood stream, and your body seeks to correct it. Really, water and salt concentrations are essentially yin and yang- one affects the other.</p>
<p>I don’t know much around the neurological response i.e. thirst centre in the brain but that’s how the physical mechanism works. The signal is carried from the stretch detecting receptor (baroreceptor) via the vagus nerve to the brain. Brain interprets the signal then tells your mouth to feel dry/that thirst feel you get. </p>
<p>Thanks u/dietus, the brain has receptors that can detect salt content (osmoreceptors), and will send out signals to stimulate thirst.</p>
<p>How much you feel you need to drink comes down to your blood pressure. Hella low = hella thirsty. Other things that can affect thirst levels are stress and diabetes so if you’re thirsty all the time you should consult a doctor.</p>
<p>Source: human biology major. (Edit one: forgot it was ELI5, explained baroreceptor, arteries. Edit two: add note about thirst signals and brain response,. Edit three: thanks r/dietus, also added ADH and osmoreceptors.  Edit four (sorry, aiming for accuracy here): corrected kidney’s role from salt detection via water concentrations to more accurate blood volume detection, thanks u/optrode!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I saw a TV show before about people surviving, probably called Against All Odds or some shit. A guy was adrift at sea in a life raft. Had a basic survival kit that comes with the raft. One of the tools was a basic fishing line. Guy was adrift for a long time, can't remember exactly. He was catching fish daily and eating pretty well considering his situation.</p>
<p>Problem was that after a few days of eating salty fish he was getting extremely dehydrated. Couldn't do much about it so continued eating the fish hoping it would sustain him. Then he said every fish he caught he was looking at the eyeballs and couldn't figure out why they were so attractive. Then he ate one, said it tasted delicious, then he was obsessed with eating the eyeballs. Turns out the eyes contain fresh water (or less salty than sea water anyway). Amazing that without him having any conscious knowledge of that, his brain directed him to eat the eyes for the water. We think we control our bodies but really our body just lets us live there and do basic maintenance for free rent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
