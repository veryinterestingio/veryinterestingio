		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A while ago a read about a zoo that had installed a small air jet just outside of the monkey enclosure, with the button to trigger a short burst inside the enclosure. The monkeys would wait until an unsuspecting human approached, then startle them with the air jet. The monkeys would erupt in hoots and shrieks when they saw the person get flustered.</p>
<p>If that's not comedy, I don't know what is. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>One of (maybe <em>the</em>) earliest forms of &quot;laughter at humor&quot; is that chimps will engage in a &quot;danger call&quot; if they see rustling in the jungle that suggests to them there's a predator nearby (a tiger for example). If it is revealed that actually, say, a small rodent caused the rustling and the danger call, the chimps will laugh and it reduces their tension.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked at a marine sanctuary for a summer.  There was a dolphin pen that was open to the ocean and the dolphins could come and go as they pleased. The dolphin scientists told us that if you’re swimming in the dolphin pen and they charge you with their teeth bared, they are just messing with you for fun.</p>
<p>I didn’t really believe it until I was in there with them.  Several of them in a row would swim at me with their mouths open and sharp teeth visible, like they were going to attack. Then, at the last second they would close their mouth, shake their head like they were giggling and make a bunch of little clicks, like the “nyuck nyuck nyuck” from the Three Stooges. It certainly felt like they got a kick out of it.</p>
<p>They would do other stuff too like come up behind you and poke you in the back with their nose when you weren’t paying attention and then swim off clicking when you turned around in surprise.  They would pull me around on their back while I held their dorsal fin and sometimes they would suddenly dive deep. Again, when I would let go and frantically swim towards the surface they would do their giggle routine of shaking their heads and clicking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a study done back in the late 90s, early aughts, I forget where, where they asked people to come in and play fetch with their dogs while they observed. I forget the exact numbers, but it was something like 60% of the people would pretend to throw the ball for the dog, but hold it. Most of them smiled or made a similar reaction while the dog frantically searched for the ball that he never saw land.  </p>
<p>Over 90% of the dogs would pretend like they were about to drop the ball or give it to the human, only to continue to hold it in their mouth. Often they would walk around in a circle or wag their tail after the human unsuccessfully reached for the ball.  </p>
<p>The study was said to show that both people and dogs get a sense of satisfaction from executing a successful deception (dogs more than people), but I think it shows a certain sense of humor as well</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
