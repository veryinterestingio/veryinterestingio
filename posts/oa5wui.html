		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An increased demand for something doesn’t automatically raise prices.  Generally it leads to increased production.  However it can lead to higher prices when production caps out.</p>
<p>Let’s say that you run a donut shop in town.  Every day you make 100 donuts, and you sell them for $1 each.  And every day, Bob comes in at 2 in the afternoon (Bob sleeps late) and buys your very last donut.  You made 100 donuts, you sold 100 donuts.  </p>
<p>Then one day you notice construction workers in the big empty field across the street from your donut shop.  They are building a new apartment complex.  Six months later it is done, and a bunch of people move in.  The first day it is open, a bunch of new people come in to try your donuts.  You sell all of your donuts by 9 am.  The rest of the day, your normal customers come in and are upset that you have no donuts for them.  Poor Bob.</p>
<p>So the next day, you make 200 donuts instead of 100.  The big crowd comes over and today you sell out by 11:00.  Poor Bob still doesn’t get a donut.  The day after you make 250 donuts, and finally everyone gets a donut.  Bob buys your last one at his usual time, and he is happy.  And you are happy because you just sold two and a half times as many donuts.  Great!</p>
<p>But then you notice that they are building <em>another</em> new apartment complex next door to the first one.  This is a problem, because your donut shop is small.  You are working your butt off to make 250 donuts in that cramped space.  You had to wake up at 3 in the morning to make all those donuts, and you don’t have room in your display case for more.  If more people come in, you are going to need to hire somebody to help you.  Unfortunately your shop is too small and the new employee wouldn’t have enough room to work.  He would always be bumping into you.</p>
<p>So six months go by and the second apartment building opens up.  Today you sell out by 9:00 again.  A whole bunch of people don’t get any donuts.  Poor Bob doesn’t get his 2:00 donut.  What are you going to do?  You can’t expand production any more without buying a bigger space and hiring more employees.  That’s expensive, and you don’t know if this increased demand is going to last.  What happens if you spend a bunch of money for a bigger space and some of those people decide they don’t want donuts anymore?  So what do you do?</p>
<p>The answer is, you increase your prices.  Donuts are now $1.50.  Some customers are upset.  They come in and say “I’m not paying a buck and a half for a donut!” And they leave.  That’s good, as long as you still sell all your donuts. As long as 250 people come in and buy a donut at your new, higher price, you made more money.  Bob comes in at 2:00 and you’ve got one last donut for him.  “Sorry Bob, I had to raise my prices.  They kept selling out and I wanted to make sure you could get one.  That’ll be a buck and a half.”  Bob grudgingly hands over an extra 50 cents and he gets his donut.</p>
<p>When demand gets really high, it’s generally better to just make more of the product.  But eventually you can’t make any more (or making more requires a lot of lead time, or carries risks, or needs a lot of up front investment).  So you either raise your prices or there it becomes first come first served and there is a shortage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s a law of economics.</p>
<p>It stems from resource scarcity. If people want something, but there’s not enough of that thing to go around, the people who want it the most will pay more money for it, which will set the price at a higher level.</p>
<p>A business will know this, they will also know that if the cost of manufacturing a product goes up, they will have to charge a higher price to cover the cost of production, and they may be unable to produce as much of it.</p>
<p>Basically scarcity affects both supply and demand. If there’s less of a product on the market, but the number of people who want that product hasn’t changed, or increased, the price will naturally go up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say you sell bottles of water. Typically you have 100 bottles of water and you regularly sell 100 bottles and you're the only supplier. One day, you only end up with 70 bottles of water, but still have 100 dollars. Since there's a shortage of supply, but you still want to make maximum profit, you can up that price because those 100 people will compete with higher prices for that water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most answers seem to be talking about the decision making behind this, but I don’t see a lot of coverage of the way this just naturally happens in a market.</p>
<p>Let’s say there are two people who know how to make product X. They can each make 100 units a month, but one of them charges $100 per unit and the other charges $110. Naturally, all business is going to go to the person charging the cheaper rate. But if demand for a given month outstrips the supply of 100 units that person can produce, anyone else who wants one will have to turn to the more expensive supplier and pay $110 instead. The price has effectively gone up.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, there will be people providing a product at a variety of prices. Low priced product gets snapped up first, moving up the price tiers until you either satisfy everyone’s needs or hit a price where no one is willing to pay it any longer. The price naturally rises when demand outstrips supply and people snatch up the lowest price items. The price naturally falls when supply outstrips demand and lower priced sellers wind up with extra stock.</p>
<p>Then, likewise, sellers will generally try to tune their prices to the individual demand they are experiencing. If I can make 5 of something, but isn’t he same timeframe I only sell two, then I may need to lower my price in order to generate more overall income, since I have unused capacity. If I can sell out by lowering my price to anything more than 2/5ths of my current price, I make more money at the lower price.</p>
<p>Likewise, if I can only make 5 units of something, but during the same timeframe I receive 10 requests for my product at my current price, then I would make more money if I raised prices until only 5 people were interested at the new price, since I can’t sell more than 5 units anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
