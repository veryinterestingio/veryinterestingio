		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe asking another question might answer your question. Can you feel the constant motion of the earth spinning on it's axis? Or the motion of the earth around the sun?</p>
<p>Yes, as someone already mentioned; there is still some air resistance up there and astronauts sometimes hear very small micro meteorites hitting the station. But in no way it might compare to the vibration of a train/plane or any other means of transportation we have on Earth.</p>
<p>The ride is smoother than a cloud-like, oil-frozen smoothest ride. ISS travel something around 7.7 km/s or 4.8 miles per second, that's at least 7 times faster than the fastest bullets, any &quot;bump&quot; in the road would be completely catastrophic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others seem to have answered your original question fairly well, but the reason trains shudder is because they are moving along rails and through air.  The ISS is beyond much of a noticeable atmosphere (at least for any day to day effects) and isn't in contact with anything.</p>
<p>But your question hints at what I think is more interesting:  Why doesn't the ISS feel like it's hurtling round the earth every 90mins?
This question is really the essence of Einstein's theories of relativity, and in part goes back to Galileo.
Galileo imagined being below deck on a ship, and essentially concluded that there was no way for you to tell if the ship was sailing or just floating without looking outside, so long as the ship wasn't speeding up or turning.  Similarly, on a train, you have no way of knowing if your speed is 0mph, 30mph, or 250mph without looking outside (or, you know, the shudder).  If you can juggle standing still, you can juggle on a train.  The same goes for a plane.  These are special cases of what are called inertial reference frames, and are the focus of Einstein's Special Relativity.  The problems arise when the train or plane is accelerating - either speeding up, slowing down, or changing direction - which is why you feel the force of a plane taking off or landing.
Now, in General Relativity, we change to focusing on free fall.  If you were in a sealed box falling through the sky, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between that and being in the middle of outer space.  You also wouldn't be able to tell what speed you were falling at, or even which direction was up.  The ISS is in orbit, which really just means it's falling towards the earth but it keeps missing.  As far as the astronauts are concerned, they could be lost in outer space, or hurtling towards the planet!  Thankfully, they are somewhere in between! :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
