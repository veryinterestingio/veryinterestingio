		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The TRPV1 is the receptor that capsaicin (spicy) binds to. It exists all over your digestive tract and nervous system. Your rectum and anus are included in this. These receptors are designed to detect “heat” to keep you safe. But they can get confused with foods that taste “hot.” They cause a reaction to cool you down, and you have a response that says, “No, this is dangerous.” </p>
<p>So you sweat, and blood flow increases, causing redness. These receptors exist in all of your digestive tract, which is why you may experience stomach pains or some cramps after eating this. Not all of it digested and so the response is activated again at the anus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no specific receptor for &quot;spicy stuff&quot;. At least that is not the intended purpose of it. The nerve endings that get activated by the capsaicin molecule are the same that transmit signals about heat/pain. So as long as there are those nerve endings, and they can be hit by the molecule, which works best on mucosa, then you can feel the spicy stuff. As for the reason why those nerve endings in the anus exist in the first place, this is more difficult to answer. I do not agree with the other answer that it does not serve any purpose. But I must admit that I can not see an obvious one either. It may just be for protection. This is the main reason why pain receptors exist. So damage is avoided.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not just your anus - it's your entire skin too. And this receptor isn't really for detecting spicy stuff - it's actually to detect heat (i.e. high temperature). Your skin has heat receptors to prevent damage, so that you can quickly move away from something hot (e.g. pull away your hand) before it burns you (too badly). For some reason, these heat receptors (at least some of them) are also chemically sensitive to a molecule that's present in spicy foods like chili peppers (specifically the <em>capsaicin</em> molecule). </p>
<p>So the reason the anus has these receptors is because your entire skin has them. Only, your anus isn't protected by an outer, tougher layer, like say the skin on your arms, and so your anus is generally more sensitive. But if you rub a hot chili pepper on your arm you'll feel it burning too.</p>
<p>In addition to being more sensitive, the reason the anus may stand out as &quot;uniquely&quot; sensitive to spicy food (or the remains thereof) is that these receptors don't exist in your intestines. So you don't feel that extra spicy Thai Curry going through your guts, but only when you poop it out as it suddenly hits those pesky receptors again, making it seem like your anus is the culprit, when arguably it's more the absence of these receptors in your gut that is causing this surprising sensation (basically, just be happy it doesn't burn the whole time).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its just heat receptors but the skin around the anus is not skin, its membrane, it absorbs chemicals easily, the remaining spice is absorbed and the capsaicin does its trick, fooling you into thinking its hot when its not. </p>
<p>If anything i can feel spice in my intestines as its very uncomfortable and i get diarrhea from it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
