		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a Netflix movie called &quot;Snowden&quot; if you want to dive deeper. It explains the events relatively well and stays close to the original events.</p>
<p>He worked for the NSA and noticed that they are collecting much more data than they were allowed. So he made copies of everything he could get his hands on, that the NSA had collected or information about. These copies he then passed on to big newspapers that went through them and then published stories about what the NSA did.</p>
<p>A lot of people think he is a hero for that as he exposed the NSA. Especially them spying on US citizens, which they first denied and was actually illegal for them to do. Other people say he is a traitor since he gave away secret information to people outside the government. One thing especially is that if some of the documents he gave to the journalists were to be revealed is that this could cause exposed agents to die through being captured.</p>
<p>This prediction has not come through and after eight years there are still many documents that haven't been released that would expose legitimate surveillance programs, private information, or secret agents.</p>
<p>There also has been criticism about him choosing to be a whistleblower instead of using proper channels to report the illegal spying. He himself said that he reported the issue to over 10 officials that never reacted and since he wasn't military or NSA personnel, but only a contractor, that there was no official avenue for him to pursue anymore.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>On the question of what the NSA is. Their main task is to collect and decrypt communication worldwide, with a focus on digital. This information is then collected, analyzed, and distributed to other US agencies like the CIA to help them with their operations or warn them of threats. To reach that they have some of the world's best hackers, install backdoors in security systems of US-based software and tap communication cables all over the world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The DNI (Director of National Intelligence) testified before Congress due to rumours that the nsa was collecting phone data. </p>
<p>Clapper, the dni, <em>before congress and under oath</em>  flatly said 'no we are not collecting such data'.</p>
<p>Snowden, an nsa worker, with access to obscene amount of personal info on all Americans, literally and metaphorically, saw this and knew he had to speak up.</p>
<p>He escaped to Russia after releasing it to Wikileaks and the Guardian. </p>
<p>Hes a hero. The US would've thrown him in the jail like they did Chelsea Manning, John Kiriakou, Reality Winner and Julian Assange figuratively. </p>
<p>These heroes leaked crimes of the government and they are the ones persecuted.</p>
<p>edit: name spelling and added location of clapper lies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
