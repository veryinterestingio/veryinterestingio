		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ocean currents.</p>
<p>The Gulf Stream, a warm water current that goes up the East Coast of the US bounces off of Cape Cod, Mass, and goes straight across to Europe.</p>
<p>To test this, try swimming in the ocean south of Cape Cod - let's say in Rhode Island, for example.  Then, drive to New Hampshire and try to swim in the ocean.  You will be able to feel the water temperature difference, especially in the summer.  </p>
<p>Then you have the Appalachian mountain range reflecting, redirecting, and funnelling cold air coming from the north.  The &quot;worst weather in the world&quot; has been recorded in New Hampshire at the peak of Mt. Washington, which isn't a &quot;big&quot; mountain on the global scale, but just happens to be in the right place to influence the weather patterns in New England and surrounding regions.  </p>
<p>Can't forget that New York is riiiiiight next to the Great Lakes, which also influence weather, especially with the cold air coming from the north and mixing with the air current known as the Jet Stream that flows across the entire North American Continent.  </p>
<p>TLDR:  Warm water in the ocean gets deflected to Spain, while the air currents from the rest of the North American continent interact with geographical features that makes NY colder.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The temperature of the atmosphere is pretty complex - hence why weather services still aren't particularly accurate. It's influenced not just by the amount of sunlight, but also by how that sunlight is absorbed and reflected by the land and sea, and by how it's absorbed by regions close to the area in question, and by how these temperature differences influence the formation of water and air currents, which can themselves alter the temperature of the area, and by the shape of the coastline and the rotation of Earth on its axis in the normal day cycle and even by the moon. Temperature is the result of a pretty chaotic combination of factors.</p>
<p>The reason New York is colder than you would expect is because the combination of factors that happen to be in place there aren't very favourable. A particularly large influence on this is the fact that the ocean is warm (due to the way ocean currents circulate temperature). This warms up the air above it which begins to spiral according to the way Earth's rotation demands - counterclockwise - creating a low pressure over New York that sucks frigid air from the north down over the state. The eastern coast of the Atlantic meanwhile has colder than normal water, which means no sucking of cold air from the north and relatively warmer climate. The same thing happens with North-east Asia (particularly Japan) and the Pacific North-west, with Asia, on the west coast of the pacific being much colder than normal and America, on the eastern coast, being much warmer than normal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe not super ELI5:</p>
<ol>
<li>Warm air rises, cold air sinks.</li>
<li>The Equator is much warmer than higher latitudes.</li>
<li>Air rises at the equator and sinks at higher latitudes (think hot air balloon).</li>
<li>Sea-level air gets &quot;sucked in&quot; towards the Equator to replace the &quot;missing&quot; rising hot air.</li>
<li>The Earth spins faster at the Equator and slower at the Poles (spin a toy globe on an axis to see why that is).</li>
<li>The air that &quot;sucks&quot; towards the Equator goes from a slower spinning area to a faster spinning area, and is deflected towards the left as a result (Coriolis effect).</li>
<li>This creates the right-to-left trade winds found across the globe.</li>
<li>These trade winds creates right-to-left ocean currents around the Equator.</li>
<li>These right-to-left ocean currents hit continents and are deflected towards the Poles on the Eastern side of continents (e.g. the U.S. coastline).</li>
<li>The Gulf Stream is created, which is composed of warm, Equatorial waters.</li>
<li>At higher latitude, the dominant winds are inverted and flow from west-to-east.</li>
<li>The Gulf Stream is pushed towards the East (Europe) and the west-to-east winds blow the Gulf-Stream heated air all over Europe.</li>
</ol>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tl;dr to sum up all the answers: latitude actually has much less to do with temperature averages than it feels like it should.  There are other factors like weather currents that have a lot more effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
