		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those that are applied by injection are inactivated flu viruses, so they don't have the ability to actually infect cells. They serve as a &quot;sample&quot; for the immune system to develop defenses against the pathogen. So, symptoms-wise, you may develop fever, headaches, fatigue, etc <em>due to the immune response</em> but nothing specifically in the airway dept because the virus is not reproducing. (The immune response is not localized in the usual tissue)</p>
<p>If it's the nasal spray vaccine, in that case it uses attenuated viruses (meaning live ones, but a strain that doesn't cause disease). Some people get a runny nose, but that's the closest to the flu-like symptoms you mention.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people do, it's just the vaccine triggered symptoms are much weaker in most cases. The severity of symptoms not only depends on the person, it also depends on the type of flu vaccine the person gets. </p>
<p>There are two main types of flu vaccines: </p>
<ol>
<li>vaccine containing weakened live virus</li>
<li>vaccine containing deactivated / split virus</li>
</ol>
<p>The split virus is &quot;dead&quot; virus with no infection capability. They are just fragments of the virus. This type of vaccine usually triggers less symptom.
Infants should only get split virus vaccine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You actually can feel the symptoms sometimes. It depends on who you are. Everyone is different. I always get really sick for about a day or two whenever I get the flu shot. My body treats it as an infection at first, but I am very sensitive to stuff like that. I think this may be the basis for some antivaxx logic that the vaccine makes you sick.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually some people do experience mild flu like symptoms after a shot, fatigue and light fever.  It's just mild because there is no actual live flu present and continuing the attack.  THey also suggest you take it easy that day after your shot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
