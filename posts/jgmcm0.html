		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A well fit men's bike should never really get in the way of their balls when standing over it. Stunt bikes tend to be very short, and mountain bikes need to be as strong as possible, which a top bar is. BMX bikes actually are made with a slanted top bar, specifically to avoid &quot;racking&quot; your nuts.</p>
<p>The lower top bar (or missing top bar) was put in place mostly for women's fashion. Originally it allowed biking while wearing a dress. Later, tight pants. The low bar allows mounting without having to lift your leg really high. This actually makes women's bikes really popular with older women, who are (at a younger age than men) more likely to have hip mobility issues. </p>
<p>The downside of a lower (or missing) top bar is that you lose a lot of the strength a traditional top bar adds to the bike. You're left with either a less resilient bike, a heavier bike, or a much more expensive build. When women still had to wear dresses, they were also expected to ride in a much more reserved manner, so the weaker frame wouldn't have been as much of an issue.  </p>
<p>You can still find modern bikes made with this lower or missing top bar, but if you look at top of the line women's road or mountain bikes, you'll find they look very much like a men's bikes. Giant's women's road bikes actually have a slight nod to the dropped top bar, with a slightly downward slanting top bar - which is more aesthetic than functional. Most of the changes have to do with the parts on the bike (special saddles, smaller gap between handle and brake or handle and shifters, and the frame usually accounts for a shorter torso. Generally, more ergonomic choices (though some cosmentic) and less... well sexist. </p>
<p>For a casual bike to ride around town, where weight doesn't matter, a dropped or non existent top tube is going to be easier to get on and off, and more easily set to a variety of riders. In fact, many bike share companies choose this set up for that reason. However, once something is labeled as &quot;women's&quot; it is really hard to convince men to get over that trend en masse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The top tube provides a lot of rigidity and strength to the bicycle frame. It's possible to design frames that are stiff and strong enough to use without one, or with a much lower top tube, but it requires much stronger structure at the down tube and seat tube joint in particular and that means more weight and/or costlier materials. And in the long run, the frame will be subject to more flexing and have a shorter lifetime. These disadvantages are fine if you literally can't ride a bicycle with a top tube, because a bike is still superior to walking in many ways even if it's heavier than it could be, but if you're interested in better performance and you can accommodate the top tube, it's a much better design.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I belelieve that the crossbar was there for strength? But then they had stronger materials so they could build bikes without those. So they started making &quot;dress friendly&quot; bikes for women. And the crossbar bikes stayed for men. But i dont believe there is another reason.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To be honest,  the Western world gets this wrong. </p>
<p>A bike without an upper frame tube is known as a &quot;step through&quot; , not specifically designed for females. </p>
<p>Much handier for delivery riders,  shorter riders, and riders that frequently dismount for various reasons, and yes, anyone wearing a dress.</p>
<p>When's the last time you saw someone wearing a dress on a bike?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The traditional 'twin triangle' shape of a bike is intended to provide the most strength at the lightest weight.</p>
<p>Triangles structurally are great shapes - so by sticking to these where possible you can make a bike stronger with tubes that are less likely to bend or fail.</p>
<p>This is especially important with bikes like mountain bikes (that need to be strong), or road bikes (which need to be very lightweight).</p>
<p>The ladies bike is an adaptation of the traditional bike design to sort fashion over performance - by dropping the top tube you make it much easier to step over the bike and mount it gracefully, and allow for skirts and dresses to be worn without getting hung up over the top tube.
When a bike is being designed for grace and dresses, out is also fair to assume it is not going to be a high performance bike, as dresses don't really make the most practical of cycling attire. So while dropping the top tube does weaken the bike, it won't take anywhere near the same abuse as a typical mountain bike will off road, and can also be built more heavily to compensate.</p>
<p>This design of bike is often known as a ladies model, but they are also fairly common for city use by males too - for example public rental bikes like London's Boris bikes use this frame style for practicality for everyone.</p>
<p>For the average male (or female wearing shorts/trousers), the higher top tube also won't typically be too much of an issue - on a properly fitted bike it should be comfortably below crotch height so the rider can easily stand over the bike. And it shouldn't be too much of a danger (unless things have gone very wrong, at which point even a lowered top tube probably isn't going to save you from getting hurt).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
