		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the eastern USA the most prominent example of a tree that is extinct (or functionally so) is the American Chestnut (<em>Castanea dentata</em>)which was killed off due to the Chestnut blight, there are continuing efforts to breed resistance into the handful of surviving trees and their offspring, with varying success. </p>
<p>We're currently losing all of the Ash trees in the USA today due to the Emerald Ash Borer. Growing up they were all through our woods and we had a half dozen or so throughout our yard, including one giant tree. Now they're all dead or dying. </p>
<p>The American Elm (<em>Ulmus americana</em>) has been suffering from Dutch Elm disease for decades and as a result mature, healthy American Elm trees are also quite rare today. </p>
<p>Those are the 3 that I am most familiar with from my part of the world (Ohio), though I'm sure there are plenty of other examples from around the world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, absolutely there are endangered trees! And they go extinct very similarly to animals, but not exactly the same since trees generally live a lot longer and are less... Hidden. Like, if you spot a tree in the wild, you know exactly where it is always going to be. But beyond that, its almost exactly the same.</p>
<p>Especially in the sense that some cultivation programs keep certain trees alive even as they're extinct or almost-extinct in the wild.  </p>
<p><a href="http://nzpcn.org.nz/flora_images_large/Pennantia-baylisiana-2.jpg" target="_blank">This tree</a> for example is the last wild tree of its kind. And its been the last one since at least the 1940s. It grows on an island off the coast of New Zealand. The rest of them went extinct when goats or sheep were introduced to the island and the little buggars ate them all. </p>
<p>There are more of those trees being cultivated in nurseries, but they haven't been introduced because researchers are concerned about potential contamination. The trees grew in complete isolation naturally; they don't want to introduce disease and pathogens to the island by planting a bunch of trees from nurseries, especially at the expense of the last one.</p>

<p>&quot; The giant sequoias are having difficulty reproducing in their original  habitat (and very rarely reproduce in cultivation) due to the seeds only  being able to grow successfully in full sun and in mineral-rich soils,  free from competing vegetation.  &quot;  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A perspective that really hasn't been addressed yet is for tropical trees. There is a MASSIVE number of species in the tropics (look up tropical biodiversity gradient for maps, papers, etc.). So much, that we really have no idea how many there are. This is especially so for trees, which are difficult to study and identify (often needing to have flowers and fruit to &quot;prove&quot; they are new species). A cool paper by ter Steege et al (link below) tried to estimate the likely number of species in the Amazon based on current records and estimate that there are likely around 16,000 species of trees in the Amazon. Of those, only ~5,000 are described. Of the undescribed species, 6,000 are expected to have numbers less than a thousand individuals, and therefore vulnerable to extinction. We cut down tropical forests at astounding rates, and studies of insects show that entire species can have small local distributions, and this pattern and the rate of deforestation is what leads to estimates that ~75 species go extinct every day (this # varies A LOT author to author, but it is practically guaranteed, as far as probability goes, that some species go extinct every day given the rate we are destroying this planet and deforestation in the tropics in particular). It is difficult to determine how many of the 11,000 undescribed tree species have gone extinct and how many are close to extinction. It depends on their distribution patterns. Deforestation is NOT randomly distributed, and most plant and animal distributions are NOT random. There are likely many tree species (a few? a dozen? dozens? who knows) going extinct in the tropics each year. They could have massive ecological value that we are unaware of (not enough research in tropics), and if you want a more utilitarian view, most of the most important medicines in the history of human society are discovered from natural organisms. These trees could have huge potential for medicine or other value to human society. But they are going extinct all the time without us even knowing they were there. </p>
