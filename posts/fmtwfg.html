		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There were a few ways to do it, but one common way was to get one or two long pieces of thin string or rope across, then use that to pull a larger rope across. </p>
<p>One method was to tie two pieces of light rope to an arrow and shoot the arrow over the river. One of the ropes would be tied taught at each end. Then, from the side opposite the archer a ring was put around the taught rope. Then the end of the other light rope was tied around the ring, and a thicker rope was also tied around the ring. Then the archer would pull on the light rope, and it would drag the thick rope back to the archerâ€™s side of the river. From there, the archer could tie an even thicker rope and have it sent back over. </p>
<p>When they built the first bridge over Niagara Falls, a similar method was used. But instead of archers, a boy flew a kite over the falls.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>That's one method, but I guess they'd typically take a smaller string that only needed to be strong enough to carry the load-bearing rope across later.</p>
<p>This may have even been done in several stages with progressively stronger/heavier ropes.</p>
<p>Firing an arrow with a string tied to it would also be an effective method to get started ;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually an arrow was tied to a string, and shot across the gap.  That string was tied to a bigger rope, and the bigger rope would be pulled across the gap.  Eventually one could work one's way up to a rope of sufficient thickness.  Once you have two of those ropes in parallel, you can begin adding planks from one of the sides.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
