<p>There are historical reasons:
Back in the day, analogue television had limited bandwidth. They used that bandwidth as well as they could and came up with a standard to transmit luminace and chrominance plus audio in that limited bandwidth. Later, when color TV was invented, they had to retrofit more chrominance information into the same bandwidth. The number of lines per second they had to transmit was also constrained by further historical reasons: electricity frequency, which goes back all the way to Tesla, the beginnings of AC, and electric motors. So, NTSC (used in the US) settled for using their 6mhz of bandwidth to transmit a 720x480 image at 29.97FPS. Other standards, PAL and SECAM, for instance, used a higher resolution at a lower framerate (720x576 @25FPS). Again, this was constrained by the fact the US uses 60hz AC, while PAL/SECAM countries (Europe, South America) used 50hz. This where interlaced signals (each frame is actually split in two and transmitted odd / even), that's why framerate is half the electricity frequency.
With the advent of digital, this same resolutions where used as a starting point. VGA was based on NTSC (640x480). As LCD screens became the norm, progressive video replaced interlaced, and 480p became the standard. Since video needs to keep its aspect ratio, both width and heigh will grow proportionally.
So, 720p is simply 1.5 times 480p, and 1080p is simply 1.5 times 720.
480 <em> 1.5 = 720 720 </em> 1.5 = 1080</p>

<p>CREDIT: /u/gnualmafuerte who answered a similar question 6 years ago. I thought it was an interesting question. I had an idea of an answer that was wrong. It is not because of binary or hexadecimal numbers. In the course of fact checking myself I came across this answer which is muy fuerte. He is quoted in full above.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Old CRTs in TVs or monitors had displays had a ratio of 4 wide by 3 high. Most numbers for displays come from simple relationships from that. For instance 16:9 in a wide screen TV is 4^2 by 3^2. The original 1987 VGA standard for computer displays was 640x480, as was PAL TV.  1920 by 1080 is 3 times 640 wide in a 16 by 9 aspect ratio.There are only a few occasions where both numbers in those relationships come out to round numbers (800:600 is one)</p>
<p>Here is a graphic of display resolution standards going back to old CGA 320x200 pixels. You can follow the aspect ratio lines to follow the relationships.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other users have already explained the historical context. On top of that, powers of two work better for computers for various reasons. If you factor all those numbers, you'll see they have a ton of 2 factors. For example, 1920 is 2^7 <em> 3 </em> 5.</p>
<p>This is how we wound up with 320x240 and 640x480. NTSC has 525 lines in the signal, and how many are visible is actually kind of variable, because back in the days of CRT TVs it just depended on exactly how the image was aligned (CRTs don't have nice perfect rectangular screens). 483 was about right. Then when computers started getting into the picture, that got rounded down to 480 (or 240 in progressive / double strike mode). That's how we wound up with a number that has a lot of 2 factors, because it got rounded like that for computers.</p>
<p>Same reason you have 16GB of RAM, not 15GB.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
