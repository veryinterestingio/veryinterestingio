		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have two things going on here.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The label can round down. So if there are 0.499 Calories in a serving it can list 0. Bonus: Serving sizes for a lot of items are arbitrary so they adjust the serving size to hit the 0 Calorie rounding sweet spot </p>
</li>
<li>Artificial sweeteners are in there in very small amounts. I forget the numbers but an easy way to explain it is that the artificial sweeteners are thousands of times sweeter than regular sugar, so you only need very tiny amounts to make something very sweet.</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously number two has a lot of nuances and complicated things going on, but that doesn't belong on ELI5.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is why in the EU and other places the amount of calories, carbs and sugars, proteins, salt, fat and saturated fat, and fibre <strong>MUST</strong> be reported per 100g.  And the net weight must also be present.</p>
<p>They may also give these values per &quot;serving&quot;, but only alongside the 100g values.</p>
<p>I was eating some chocolate today that listed the serving size as 3 squares of chocolate.  The bar is made in rows of 4 squares...</p>
<p>But the bar was 85g (and yes I ate the whole thing).</p>
<p>I thought something similar had recently been brought in in the US too, residually in light of stuff like Tic Tacs have &quot;zero&quot; Calories per services despite being almost 100% sugar.  Please tell me I didn't imagine that ruling from several months ago...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If a product is below like 15 calories per serving, it can be labeled as 0 calories. Coffee is famous for having zero calories when it’s actually 5-10 calories a serving.</p>
<p>Tic Tacs infamously list a single mint as the serving size, so despite being little sugar pills, they’re printed as 0 calories.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
