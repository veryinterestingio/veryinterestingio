		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to StatNews (<a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/10/tracking-the-fda-advisory-panel-meeting-on-the-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine/" target="_blank">FDA advisory panel endorses Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine</a>) the main issue was approval for 16 and 17 year olds. None of the panel had concerns about the 18-plus age group, but some thought Pfizer hadn’t fully proven safety in the 16 and 17 year olds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Several members of the committee expressed serious concerns about including 16- and 17-year-olds in the EUA, saying Pfizer has very little data on the vaccine’s safety in this group. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s not to say that there’s any sign that it’s <em>not</em> safe in those ages, but just that it hasn’t been fully proven yet, in the opinion of those four panelists. At least some of them said they would have voted to approve 18-plus. </p>
<p>Other panelists pointed out that there <em>is</em> evidence of benefit, and there’s no evidence of danger, and that in general 16 and 17 year olds tend to react (immunologically) like 18-plus rather than like children.</p>
<p>Note that this is an advisory committee to the FDA, not the FDA itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>[<strong>Dr. Cody Meissner</strong>]: Yes.
