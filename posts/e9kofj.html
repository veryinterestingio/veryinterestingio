		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>This one got a bit long, but it's my attempt to do three things. 1) Actually write in an ELI5 style. 2) Provide some history and context. 3) Clear up misconceptions and point out that we're not 100% sure.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Enjoy:</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Did you know that orchestras didn't always have double basses in them? They're one of the newest instruments in the orchestra. Even so, we're not exactly sure where the name comes from. People have two main ideas, so I'll tell you both of them, but first I'll tell you about the history. </p>
<p>Before the double bass was a part of the orchestra, the lowest instrument was the cello. The cello goes pretty low (almost as low as a double bass, actually), and plays in about the same range as the lowest human voices. We call those voices &quot;bass voices.&quot; In fact, the cello reads music in what is called the &quot;bass clef.&quot; If we really think about it, it would be totally fine to call the cello a &quot;bass violin!&quot; It kinda acts like one! </p>
<p>But then orchestras wanted an even lower sound. They added this new, even bigger string instrument into their orchestras. Because it was new, none of the old sheet music had parts for this new instrument. So what did orchestras do? They gave the &quot;cello&quot; part to these new basses, and asked them to play it one octave lower. These new basses were &quot;doubling&quot; the part on the bass clef. </p>
<p>That's one idea of where the name &quot;double bass&quot; comes from.</p>
<p>But if that were true, why don't other languages call it the double bass? Around that time, Italy was the musical center of the world, so why don't they call it a &quot;doble basso?&quot; Wait, what do Italians call the instrument? They call it <em>contrabbasso.</em> In Germany it's <em>kontrabass</em>, in France it's <em>contrebasse</em>, and in Spain it's <em>contrabajo</em>. </p>
<p>So the other idea is it's just the English language translation of &quot;contrabbasso.&quot; <em>Contra</em> usually means &quot;opposite&quot; but in this word it means &quot;extra.&quot; It's like, &quot;yeah, you've already got a bass, but this one is <em>extra</em> bass.&quot; You can imagine the English speaking musicians translating the phrase &quot;contrabass&quot; into &quot;double bass&quot; in order to say &quot;it plays an even lower range than a normal bass instrument. It's extra bass. It's double the bass.&quot;</p>
<p>So where does the name &quot;contrabass&quot; come from?</p>
<p>When orchestras wanted to add a new, low instrument, they didn't invent one from scratch, they looked around to see if something already existed. One family of instruments were the &quot;viols.&quot; These ranged in size from small to big, just like violins, violas, and cellos. There was a viol that was pretty close to the size of a cello, called the &quot;bass viol,&quot; but there was an even bigger one called a &quot;contrabass viol.&quot; Orchestras grabbed this already existing instrument, and asked them to play the cello parts down an octave. </p>
<p>After a while &quot;contrabass viol&quot; got shortened to &quot;contrabass.&quot; </p>
<p>Nowadays, in English, there are a lot of names for the instrument. As a professional player, the term I use is &quot;upright bass.&quot; You could also say double bass, contrabass, string bass, stand-up bass, acoustic bass, bass fiddle, or bull fiddle!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In four part harmony, you have soprano, alto, tenor, and bass in choral music. These names transfer to other voicings of music because they have functional meaning to musicians. The soprano is the melody 80-90% of the time, and likewise the alto and tenor are supportive harmonic notes. The bass is the fundamental of a chord, defines what key you're in as well as the measurement for all of the other notes to tune from.  </p>
<p>In string music, you have Violin I, Violin II, Viola, and Cello respectively. The string bass would play the same notes as the cellos in early string music well into the classical period. So they were literally doubling the bass, sounding an octave lower, to give more harmonic weight to the important bass notes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple competing answers here, with people going &quot;THIS IS THE REAL ANSWER&quot; in the replies.</p>
<p>The REAL real answer is that nobody knows. The two leading hypotheses are that it's an octave lower (we see this nomenclature with tuba as well, which is sometimes said to be in &quot;double&quot; B-flat), or that it originally &quot;doubled&quot; the cellos.</p>
<p>But nobody knows for sure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
