		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, everyone, I'm leading habits expert Dr. BJ Fogg. I am a behavior scientist, with deep experience in innovation and teaching. I run the Behavior Design Lab at Stanford University, and I also teach my models and methods in graduate seminars. Over 25 years ago I was reading Aristotle's Rhetoric when I realized that someday computers would be designed to influence humans. Being a natural optimist, I imagined many benefits of combining persuasion and technology. I decided to explore this area scientifically. As a doctoral student at Stanford in the 1990s, I ran the first-ever series of experiments to discover how computers could change people's attitudes and behaviors. I named this new area &quot;persuasive technology.&quot; My research won Stanford's Maccoby Prize and spawned an international academic conference, going on 10 years now.</p>
<p>After graduation I started working in Silicon Valley, but I also devoted about half my time to Stanford. I founded a new Stanford lab in 1998. And each year since then, I've created a new course on a topic that interests me. I no longer do industry consulting. Instead, these days I focus on teaching innovators about human behavior--my models and methods in Behavior Design--so they can create products to help people be healthier and happier. The focus areas include health, financial wellbeing, learning, productivity, and more. My current projects include the Good Habit Project, out of my design lab at Stanford; designing for behavior change; and, of course, my new book, Tiny Habits: The Small Changes that Change Everything. It was an instant New York Times bestseller for a reason: it keeps its promise to change your life with actionable tools to transform your behavior quickly and easily. There's a reason resolutions, repetition, and willpower don't work when it comes to forming lasting habits.</p>
<p>I'm here to share expertise gained from decades of my own original research and personal experience coaching thousands of others about what it takes to wire in a new habit, and what (tiny) steps you can take today to start your own life-changing transformation. My book cracks the code on a fundamental part of how human behavior works when it comes to forming new habits, framed in terms of my Fogg Behavior Model, which states that behavior happens when three elements come together at the same moment: motivation, ability, and a prompt. I write it like this: B = MAP. This model is easy to learn and apply to everyday life. When something is easy to do, we don't need much motivation to do it. There are no tricks here, no weird fads. It's basic science, and it can be applied to any behavior--so don't hesitate to ask me anything! I'm so looking forward to answering all of your habit questions with specific tools, recipes, and advice. See you at 3 (ET, 20 UT), AMA!</p></div></div>
