<p>I just fell asleep in class with the camera off and when the professor called my name to make sure my group was ready to present I immediately woke up to say that I was in the lecture and almost had a heart attack because missing this specific lecture is an automatic fail. I wanted to ask anyone as to why we wake up if someone calls our name even when we've been asleep for 10+ minutes, but don't wake up when hearing other people's names or the lecture content.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain does still process sounds from your environment even while you're sleeping. Obviously it would be detrimental to your sleep to awaken for every sound, so you're able to &quot;tune out&quot; a lot of unnecessary stimuli. You're able to recognize important sounds, though, like your own name or one of your children or pets in distress. How much you're able to process and how fast you wake up will depend on the stage of sleep that you're in. </p>
<p>There's even some research that shows that when you're sleeping in an unfamiliar environment, you &quot;sleep with one eye open&quot; by sleeping lighter and remaining more alert to more potential threats.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain stores different words in different ways depending on their meaning and importance. For example, swear words are stored in a totally different way and that’s part of what gives them their power in our speech. One such word that has extra importance is our name. Our brains are constantly on the lookout for our name because hearing it means we’re needed. </p>
<p>Also, when we’re asleep, our bodies are silently processing stuff still and absorbing information. That’s why you might wake up to a loud noise or someone nudging you. </p>
<p>Combine these two things and now you have a brain that will wake you up when your name is called.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cocktail Party Phenomenon. Most people are conditioned early in life to respond to their own name through positive reinforcement (e.g. parents cooing an infant's name, then being especially tender when the child reacts).</p>
<p>Your name might very well be the first word you ever truly understand, and is important simply because it is how you identify yourself. This wasn't always the case. Prior to germ theory, infant mortality rates were so high that it was not uncommon for a child to be 4-5 years old before  being christened with a name. My own great grandfather named himself Abraham Lincoln McKenzie, after the Great Emancipator when his family emigrated to the USA in the mid-19th century. He was five at the time and (correctly) thought Lincoln was the cat's pajamas. </p>
<p>At any rate, our platonic senses are at all times bombarded by stimuli that is largely irrelevant b-roll stock information. Our conscious mind tends to tune almost all of it out, but it does not go unnoticed by our subconscious mind (apologies if I am using outdated nomenclature). But certain stimuli sponsor greater alertness, because they hold a greater position of importance (like seeing a spider in your periphery).</p>
<p>In a cocktail party setting, the din of voices becomes background to the conversation you are engaged in. But hearing your name from across the room immediately heightens your awareness, because it is the most primitive and important word you know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a doctor but I believe it's due to the Reticular Activating System (RAS). Its a bundle of nerves in your brain that is responsible for filtering information. A typical example of its function is hearing someone say your name in a noisy crowd. I believe it's also like a watchdog when you sleep so you dont sleep through someone breaking into your house.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
