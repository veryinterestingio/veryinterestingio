		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're correct, the answer is they inhibit reuptake, not the receptors. But what does that mean?</p>
<p>The two communicating cells are next to each other with a physical gap between them. Neurotransmitters are chemicals that act as little &quot;signal balls&quot;. The sending-cell shoots out the neurotransmitter molecules into this gap between cells, they cross the gap, and then bind to receptors on the receiving cell. However there needs to be a way for that signal to &quot;end&quot;, for 2 reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>If the message is &quot;hey I'm firing and you should fire too&quot;, you don't want the receiving cell just firing constantly forever, so the sending-cell needs to turn off the effect of the neurotransmitters it just released into the gap.</li>
<li>The next time the sending cell wants to send a message, it would be great to reuse some of those signal balls rather than having to make completely new ones each time.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a result of those 2 things, there is <em>reuptake</em>. Basically, the sending-cell then starts absorbing the neurotransmitter it previously released out of the gap and back into itself. This turns off the message it was sending, and allows it to re-use those neurotransmitters later.</p>
<p>Now, depression etc can have many physical causes. Cells not producing or releasing enough neurotransmitters as they should be, receiving cells not having as many receptors as they should have, or having defective receptors, etc. Turns out you can improve all of those different problems by blocking or slowing down the reuptake! It lets whatever neurotransmitter is managing to be released into the gap hang out there longer and build up to higher levels. That way, it can at least partly overcome slow release rates, few receptors etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some good responses here, I'll just throw my analogy into the mix.</p>
<p>Imagine your brain as a traffic grid. Serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and other molecules like these (called neurotransmitters) are like green lights, red lights, yield signs, or so on. </p>
<p>Happiness (or any subjective component of human experience) isn't a function of a single intersection, it's a function of the entire traffic grid. All the cars and trucks need to be getting to their destinations for your brain to be happy and healthy. For the sake of the analogy, let's say traffic not having long enough yellow lights is causing numerous traffic accidents. A single accident doesn't matter so much in the grand scheme of the traffic grid, but if across the board you are getting many fender benders all over the grid because of these too-short yellow lights, then applying a software patch to all the traffic lights in your traffic brain to lengthen those yellow lights will give your traffic a chance to not get into so many accidents. </p>
<p>A drug that blocks serotonin reuptake would be like that software patch: a way to get a certain signal to fire a little longer than it would otherwise. </p>
<p>It isn't that yellow lights make the traffic run better; it's that the yellow lights are now letting the cars get to their destination in a way we prefer. Similarly, it isn't that serotonin is a happy molecule; it's that having more of it stay in the synaptic cleft for a bit longer is letting your brain have a greater likelihood of giving you a non-depressed state of being. </p>
<p>In other words, the molecules are signals. SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclics, etc. can be thought (in the brain, at least), as dampening or amplifying certain characters of certain signals. Having more of the signal does not necessarily solve anything, but having more of the signal in the right time and place gives your brain a fighting chance of wiring things differently than it did before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to what others have said, SSRIs don’t always work and if they do take some time to work rather than immediately. </p>
<p>So it’s not as simple as just increasing serotonin levels in the brain and you instantly feel better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that, at least when this class of antidepressants was introduced, it was very well understood HOW they worked, but not why.  E.g., if blocking the reuptake of serotonin was all it took to fix depression, patients should experience results in hours, not the weeks it often takes.  Maybe the rest of the cause/effect relationship is understood now; my data is at least a decade old.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
