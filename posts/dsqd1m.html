		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the gas in space really is quite hot. Most of the volume of the &quot;interstellar medium&quot; - the gas distributed within a galaxy - is an ionised plasma at around 10,000 K. In intergalactic space, the gas is a hot blob of plasma that has largely been ejected from galaxies through supernova explosions, so it's at ~1,000,000 K. It's only really in dense cool molecular clouds that you get to room temperature or below.</p>
<p><em>But</em> this is an extremely thin gas, and it doesn't transfer heat to solid objects very efficiently, because the rate of collisions is so low. On a human scale, it doesn't feel like a gas/plasma at all, but more like an insulating vacuum. How much a probe heats up or cools down comes down to: how much heat does it produce, how much heat is lost through radiation, and how much heat is gained from radiation. You get heated up by nearby stars and your own internal power source, and cooled down by thermal radiation.</p>
<p>Once you are far away from the Sun, you really don't get don't get much heat at all from the background of Milky Way stars. So the general tendency is to cool down - you emit more radiation than you receive. This is quite a slow process: for a human in a space-suit it's slowed down by your body converting food &amp; air into heat. A human in a space-suit without heating might die of hypothermia, but it'll be over days - they won't be snap frozen like in Mission to Mars. For a probe or satellite, you can even get the opposite problem - the power source might be producing too much heat, and you need to think about how to design it to make sure it cools down.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> interstellar space is full of hot gas that feels cold, but not <em>that</em> cold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the same reason as why you can put your hand inside a hot oven without feeling anything but a vague drying sensation, but if you grab a hot tray, you'll be burned. The heat that is conducted to an object depends on both the temperature of the surrounding matter, and the amount of matter the object comes into contact with. In space, while the matter is very very hot, there's hardly any of it, so Voyager just doesn't receive much heat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A 4,000K hot spark won't do you much damage.</p>
<p>I would be extremely hesitant to grab a 600K hot rod, despite it being 3,400K cooler.</p>
<p>Each individual particle is moving very quickly, but are very small and don't have a lot of energy. There aren't a lot of particles, so any given volume has very little energy. As space is a hard, hard vacuum, the number of particles hitting the Voyager probe is very low, so they have, collectively, no significant energy to impart on the probe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is associating temperature with mean free path and velocity which gives weird results like this. Space is very empty so what few particles remain can move very far very fast, which implies a high temperature.</p>
<p>But because the density is so low, the heat capacity ( how much heat it can store ) of the interstellar medium is very very low as well and so very little heat is actually there that can be transferred to anything that enters it.</p>
<p>Its like if you stick your hand in boiling water you instantly get burns. But that same hand can spend several seconds in a 450 degree oven holding a pizza paddle because hot air and radiant heating aren't as good as transferring heat to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As noted, big difference between heat and temperature.</p>
<p>A burning match has a very high temperature.  In round figures, 1,000C.</p>
<p>Boiling water is only 100C, downright chilly by comparison.</p>
<p>You could clap the match between you hands until it was cold with little expectation of injury.   Don't try cooling off the boiling water using your hands.  Too much heat, and too fast at transferring it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
