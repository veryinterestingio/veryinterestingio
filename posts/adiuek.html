Is there a similar, standardized system used for describing the position/direction of travel of spacecraft and celestial bodies? I'm not sure if I've phrased this as well as I could, but I hope the gist of the question is clear enough.</p>
<p>Edit: thanks for your replies everybody! I've learned a lot today, but most importantly I have learned that the enemy's gate is down.</p>
<p>Edit the second:
Boy howdy, this really got a lot of attention! A few people have expressed interest in learning more about the book I'm writing (I made this post for research purposes) so I'm thinking I'll put together some sort of webpage to keep those who are interested up to date. </p>
<p>It may take a day or two, but I'll post an update when I have something! </p></div></div>

So we extended that idea to the solar system, and to the universe as a whole. There’s a north and south, but it’s completely arbitrary which way is north. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On a slightly unrelated note that OP may find interesting. NASA and others have been looking into the feasibility of a &quot;GPS&quot; or Galactic Positioning System which would use pulsars as semi-fixed navigation beacons. The original theory suggested that you'd be able to fix your position down anywhere in the galaxy (and quite a bit outside it as well) to within a few inches just by seeing any six catalogued pulsars.</p>
<p>Unfortunately as our understanding of pulsars has grown we've learned that this system isn't terribly likely to be immediately useful beyond a few light years from Earth. The reason being that pulsar emissions are a lot narrower than we'd originally assumed. So shifting your position by several light years is enough to no longer receive the pulses from some of the pulsars and you have no guarantee that you'd start seeing new ones to pick up the slack.</p>
<p>In theory if pulsars are as common as we think they might be, then you SHOULD always be able to see at least a few and you'd just have to do a bit of catalogue logging such that as you leave the view of some stars you know which ones you are entering the view of.</p>
<p>If true then it is mostly a matter of building out that catalogue as we expand into the universe. That said, if for some reason you should lose your logging data there is the strong possibility you may not be able to refix your position. Partly this is because one of the ideas behind pulsars is that they all seemed to be unique in terms of things like frequency and strength, however this is not perfect for two reasons. The first being that strength is partly dependent on how close/far you are to the pulsar in question. The second being that as we slowly lock down an idea of just how many pulsars there are in the galaxy it is looking ever more likely that there will be overlap on frequencies.</p>
<p>Ideally you should still be able to run a pattern match and ask the catalogue &quot;I see the following sets of frequencies/strengths at the following angles from my position. What set of known pulsars would have to exist for this to be the case?&quot;, however this is an extremely open ended problem and there's no guarantee that you'd be able to actually solve it to any degree of satisfaction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is going to sound like a joke response, but it might actually add some &quot;perspective.&quot; </p>
<p>In the book &quot;Ender's Game&quot; they discuss the fact that in space there is no spacial orientation. To help explain how to battle in zero-G, the main character Ender explains that &quot;the enemy's gate is down.&quot; </p>
<p>The perspective is useful because it helps to visualize falling toward an object in any direction instead of traveling like a car or airplane. Most systems of &quot;north,&quot; &quot;south,&quot; &quot;up,&quot; or &quot;down&quot; normally have earth as their reference point, but truthfully in space these are arbitrary. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are additional directions to describe relative position for objects in orbit, most of which are drawn from maritime and aviation terminology, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nadir- This is the direction towards the center of the planet, straight down. Opposite to Nadir is the Zenith.</li>
<li>Velocity Vector- Direction of movement, Prograde/retrograde are common, Prograde is the direction of orbit, retrograde opposite</li>
<li>Normal direction to plane of orbit. This is often referred to as the angular momentum vector.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a million different coordinate systems you can use depending on what you want to do.</p>
<p>You can use the Earth and its orientation as a coordinate system (ECEF)-- most useful for things on Earth and aircraft, etc.</p>
<p>You can use coordinates centered on the Earth but with absolute axes-- Northward, and two axes perpendicular to that protruding from the equator.</p>
<p>You can use the Sun as the center of a coordinate system (heliocentric coordinates)-- useful for things in orbit around the sun or neighboring stars.</p>
<p>There's various galactic coordinate systems and observable-universe base coordinate systems, too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
