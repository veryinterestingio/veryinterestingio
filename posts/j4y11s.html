		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oat fiber can adsorb <em>some</em> of the cholesterol in your gut so that you don't absorb it into your blood stream. This would only effect  the cholesterol that you eat which is a small fraction of the total cholesterol in your body and blood. Serum cholesterol levels are more strongly influenced by the overall calorigenicity of your diet, refined carbs and sugars, than the animal products that contain cholesterol.</p>
<p>Your liver can manufacture more cholesterol in a day than you can possibly cram into your face in a month. &quot;Oat bran can lower blood cholesterol levels&quot; is largely marketing bullshit. Relying on your Honey Nut Cheerios to alter your serum cholesterol levels is a fool's game.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lastest body of research point to a completely different mechanism for the cholesterol lowering effect of dietary fibers. because the impact of fibers is so big, it can't be explained only by the cholesterol absorption in the gut.</p>
<p>Cholesterol is a scavenger for toxins produced by bacteria in the gut. cholesterol can bind to a large variety of toxic byproducts thus is a sort of cleaning agent. (unfortunately in high quantities can also stick to blood vessels and clog them...)</p>
<p>more fibers mean:</p>
<p>1)your intestine is less permeable to toxic byproducts of bacteria  2) shifts the balance towards a healthier (more friendly) microbial population.</p>
<p>so your liver need to produce less cholesterol to scavenge bacterial byproducts from your gut blood vessels.</p>
<p>this is also coherent to the main evidence, that a lower cholesterol diet is not very effective in reducing blood cholesterol levels, so it must come from our body. while a high fiber diet is very effective in reducing cholesterol. it would not make sense otherwise.</p>
<p>edit: formatting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s a whole class of medications call Bile Acid sequestrants.
What happens is this, bile that is produced in the liver and stored in the gal bladder is made from cholesterol. Fiber binds to bile during digestion which prevents it from being reabsorbed in the small intestine. Bile acts to break down fats, kinda like how dish soap breaks it down in your sink, which allows your body to absorb it. More over, if bile is sequestered and not reabsorbed your liver will have to make more, which requires cholesterol. Your liver then takes cholesterol from your blood stream and manufactures more bile from it. Doing the daily definitely increases bile production which in turn uses more and more cholesterol from the blood. </p>
<p>Hope that helps. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a modest explanation from two home medical sources. Hope it helps! ☺️ Interestingly enough, Weetbix now come in a cholesterol lowering variant (which contain added phytosterols). </p>
<p>&quot;Oatmeal contains soluble fiber, which reduces your low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, the &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol. Soluble fiber is also found in such foods as kidney beans, Brussels sprouts, apples and pears. Soluble fiber can reduce the absorption of cholesterol into your bloodstream. Five to 10 grams or more of soluble fiber a day decreases your LDL cholesterol.&quot;</p>
<p>Source:l (<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/cholesterol/art-20045192#:~:text=Oatmeal%20contains%20soluble%20fiber%2C%20which,of%20cholesterol%20into%20your%20bloodstream" target="_blank">https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/cholesterol/art-20045192#:~:text=Oatmeal%20contains%20soluble%20fiber%2C%20which,of%20cholesterol%20into%20your%20bloodstream</a>.)</p>
<p>Phytosterols (plant sterol and stanol esters) are compounds found in small amounts in foods such as whole grains as well as in many vegetables, fruits, and vegetable oils. They decrease LDL cholesterol, mostly by interfering with the intestinal absorption of cholesterol.</p>
