		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ideally the terminal settlement speed of a particle is directly proportional to the centrifugal force acting on it. So, ideally yes. Practically, you'll have diffusion counteracting it more noticeably the slower you spin. So you probably can spin a sample in a benchtop centrifuge until the cows come home and still not get an effect comparable to a fast run in a preparative ultracentrifuge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No,  </p>
<ul>
<li>As other post already mentioned, diffusion can 'mix' phases of a product faster than a weak force gradient separate them.</li>
<li>Independently, I'd expect that separation is not linear with the time: if in, say, 1h (at fixed 'g') you can separate half of the (pure enough) product that interest you, in 3h you would not separate 3/2 of all the desired product (that make no sense). i'd expect the evolution of successfully separated matter to be invert-exponential like.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So many convoluted answers here. It's more simple actually:</p>
<p>If you centrifugate for infinite time, distributions of your particles by radius r (measured from centrifuge's axis) will be given by Boltzmann distribution
c(r) ~ exp( (M-m)ω^2 r^2 )/(kT) )
where c(r) is the particle concentration at radius r, M is the mass of sedimenting particle, m is how much liquid it displaced (i.e. density of liquid multiplied by particle's volume), ω is the angular velocity of the centrifuge. k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature. In this formula the gravitational acceleration is assumed to be negligible in comparison to the centrifugal acceleration. Symbol &quot;~&quot; means proportional; it means you should put there appropriate prefactor constant so that the net amount of particles in the flask (integral of concentration by the volume) is equal to it's initial value.</p>
<p>When centrifugation begins, the system gradually transitions from initial state (e.g. uniform concentration) to the ultimate state with Boltzmann's distribution (previous paragraph). How gradually? To first approximation, particle's sedimentation velocity v would be proportional to centrifugal acceleration r·ω^2 . The proportionality factor s = v/(r·ω^2 ) is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedimentation_coefficient" target="_blank">sedimentation coefficient</a> and only depends on the sedimenting particle itself (mainly size and mass) and on the liquid (mainly on liquid's dynamic viscosity), but not on centrifugal acceleration (except for some unusual cases when the Reynolds number is high, i.e. for huge particles in low-viscosity medium, think bowling ball in water).</p>
<p>So, even looking at the Boltzmann's distribution (limit at infinite centrifugation time), you can conclude that the answer to your question is &quot;no&quot;. Furthermore, looking at the sedimentation velocity relation, you can see that velocity is proportional to ω^2 , not to ω (as assumed in your question), so the answer is also &quot;no&quot;.</p>
<p>TL;DR: No.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends.</p>
<p>In a rotation your centrifugal force is equal to mass times the square of velocity over the radius. </p>
<p>Your sediment velocity of separation is equal to the square of your centrifuges diameter multiplied by the difference between particle density and medium density over the medium’s viscosity all multiplied by the relative centrifugal force (RCF). The RCF your particles feel doesn’t match the the actual centrifugal force. This is because the fluid will apply a buoyancy force in opposition (which is dependent on the viscosity, surface area of particles, and temperature of the fluid).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
