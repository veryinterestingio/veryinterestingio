<p>Perhaps the Earth's rotations is too slow for something to travel the same speed <em>and</em> remain in orbit. </p>
<p>But I was curious to know if there was a point in Earth's orbit where you could plant a big anchor or something and it would basically follow the Earth's rotation.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is what geostationary orbit is. The orbital period is as fast as Earth rotation so that satellite will stay above a fixed point over the ground.  For Earth this is around 36000km altitude and is in heavy use.</p>
<p>This is useful for a few reasons. First it lets you park a spacecraft over a region of interest and it stays there. You don't need tons of spacecraft to provide the service you want. Secondly the spacecraft appears stationary from the ground too. It's always at the same place in the sky. That way it's easy to point an antenna at it and you don't need to have complex electronics or mechanical systems to move the antenna or track where the spacecraft is.</p>
<p>In practice geostationary spacecraft are use a lot for things like satellite TV (the dish people have on their roof) and communication.</p>
<p>There are a few limitations to geostationary satellites tho. They are pretty far away from the ground so signal takes time to reach them. This means that at best you have a 0.25s lag from just the speed of light alone. You also need them to be above the equator if you want them to be truly stationary. This means that it can get a bit crowded on that orbit (and there are strict rules on its use). It's also less practical for regions nearer to the poles where you have a harder time seeing the spacecraft  (this is why Russia sometime uses Molniya orbits).</p>
<p>The fact that the axis of rotation of the Earth is tilted relative to the Moon and the Sun also means that their gravitational pull will disturb spacecraft in geostationary orbit over time and they need some propulsion to stay in place otherwise they will slowly drift over time.</p>
<p>Edit: since I see a lot of people mentioning GPS. GPS (and international equivalents) do not use geostationary orbits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People are mentioning geostationary, which is correct for your question. But, there are two other very interesting &quot;orbits&quot; that you might want to read about. </p>
<p>Geosynchronous orbits match the orbital period but will fluctuate in position WRT the ground throughout the day. These can be useful for higher latitude locations.</p>
<p>Lagrange points are a cool phenomenon. Basically an inflection point between two large bodies like the earth and the moon, where the gravitational forces are balanced. An object can &quot;park&quot; there and use no fuel to maintain position. There are only a few of these points per system.</p>
<p>Take a look!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Geostationary orbit. Yes.</p>
<p>There are things that use this.</p>
<p>But the object is still (in most cases, depending on your reference point) moving 'faster' than the person standing on the ground below. (Assuming your reference point is the earth's rotational axis, and you are measuring 'speed' as 'how fast is it moving along the circumference of it's orbit?')</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Thats where you point your satellite dish at.</p>
<p>Off topic, starlink is different because they are much lower. They keep moving being at the “wrong” altitude. You wont point a dish at them because they keep moving. The basics of the starlink deaign is launch enough, spread out, that there is always one close enough for a not aimed antenna.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
