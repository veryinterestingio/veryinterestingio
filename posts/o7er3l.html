		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apologies in advance if the question begs anti-science supposition about current events. </p>
<p>The recent collapse of a condominium happened <del>after 3 days of the highest tides of the month in Miami. What's more, it happened 15 minutes prior the lowest tide.</del> after two days of tides in excess of 3 feet (highest of the month), about an hour before the low tide. Naturally, I'm wondering if there has been any observed co-occurrence of tides and subsidence.</p>
<p>Edit: And naturally I have misconjugated the question. <em>Do tide levels...</em>, <em>Does tide level...</em></p>
<p>Second edit: facts corrected.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't directly address sinkhole formation, but I can speak about the tides. First, the max tide range was today (Thursday, 6/24) with a high of 3.1 and a low of -0.8 (ft MLLW), not 3 days ago. Low tide was about 50 minutes after the collapse(01:30), at 02:20. That low tide was only -0.1 ft, however....the low tide in the afternoon was -0.8 ft. A low of around -0.1 ft is only 0.1 ft lower than the <strong>mean daily lowest tide</strong> height. In other words, the low tide just after the collapse happens <em>all the time</em>. </p>
<p>Second, tides vary on a fortnightly (14 day) cycle. The &quot;highest tides of the month&quot; actually occur twice a month (sure, one is usually a bit higher, but they're about equal...) so it doesn't really mean much. It's called the spring-neap cycle where spring tides have the greatest range (difference between high and low) and neap tides have the smallest range. It's 7 days between the spring and neap tides.  If it really was &quot;3 days after the highest tides&quot;  (which it wasn't) that would mean it was right in the middle between the spring and neap tides and hence about a mean tidal range. There is some variation in spring tidal range throughout the year (see King Tides) but this is usually smaller than the difference between the spring and neap range.</p>
<p>Tides can be observed in groundwater wells, but the effects are small, on the order of 10 cm from my quick Google search. In the Miami area, it's probably even smaller as the tidal range there is relatively small (about 3.9 ft during the current spring tide). It is small enough that it could be confused with/obscured by daily patterns of well drawdown. Also, recharge from precipitation probably provides way more total variability than the tides.</p>
<p>Overall, while observable in groundwater, tides are pretty unlikely to be related to sinkhole formation. If they play a role in sinkhole formation at all, it's likely due to the constant cycling of the tide causing long-term stress on the soil/rock (similar to the  frost-heave cycle) rather than any single tidal cycle. Florida has highly soluble bedrock too (see Karst Terrain) which naturally leads to sinkholes. This doesn't require tides, only a &quot;normal&quot; aquifer to dissolve the rock and generate sinkholes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Differences in pressure (higher at surface/lower underground) can trigger a sinkhole to collapse.  This article cites heavy rainfall or groundwater drawdown as potential mechanisms.  Maybe low tide could draw the water level down if you are close enough to the coast but I do not know much about that. <a href="https://www.sjrwmd.com/education/sinkholes/" target="_blank">https://www.sjrwmd.com/education/sinkholes/</a></p>
<p>Sinkhole formation is a chemical process though, there needs to be limestone dissolution underground for there to be a hole to collapse in the first place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
