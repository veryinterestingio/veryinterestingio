		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, you don't fly off into space.  You can barely jump like maybe the height of your body and then you &quot;fall back to the Earth&quot; pretty damn fast.  So in a way the Earth's gravity is strong enough to keep you on Earth, and weak enough to merely keep the Moon in orbit.</p>
<p>The force of gravity itself increases with mass, but decreases with the SQUARE of the distance, and the Moon, while &quot;immense&quot;, is also quite some distance away, compared to how close you are to the Earth.</p>
<p>But ultimately, tie a rock to a rope and see what force is required to &quot;keep the rock from breaking the rope and flying away&quot;.  If you put the rock and the rope on the ground, the force required is 0.  If you pick it up and start spinning it around above your head, you'll have to hold the rope with some force.  You'd have to spin very fast to actually have the rock break that rope, beyond what you can do with just your muscles.</p>
<p>So bottom line, the Moon doesn't spin around the Earth all that fast.  Gravity is enough to keep it there, like a rope would.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I really want to try to explain this in a bit more complex way that really made it all click on my head. Hopefully everyone can follow along.</p>
<p>So to start with, we should note that  there are two forces that act on you: gravity pulling you down, and Earth under you, refusing to let you in and therefore pushing you up. A net result is, you stay roughly still.</p>
<p>So, to understand gravity better, lets erase Earth with its upward pulling, space-taking, ball-resembling properties and just leave the gravitational field. Basically, we make it so that you can freely fall through Earth unaffected by anything other than its gravity, to better understand gravity.</p>
<p>Now, for you this would mean you start falling. But once you are at or near the center of Earth, it's not like you stop. Your momentum now keeps carrying you away from Earths core, and you emerge from the other side at about the same height as you started with, before gravity finally wins and manages to turn you around and make you fall back towards Earths core.</p>
<p>So when you think about path you trace, you notice it would resemble a line, or perhaps an ellipse if you started with sideways motion. And now to high school physics part of this, you notice that all you're doing is exchange gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy and back. Your total energy stays the same always.</p>
<p>And this means, without using energy to change your trajectory, you could not reduce this total energy you have and stay, on average, closer to Earths core. You make flybys but cannot stop going away again. </p>
<p>And you notice, for Moon these scenarios, with fall-through Earth and real Earth, are identical. Moon just keeps falling but has enough sideways motion that instead of huge yoyo motion, it does something more resembling circular orbit.</p>
<p>And to go back to the example of you jumping, that can be seen as you adding a tiny extra bit of energy to your orbit. But on real Earth, this orbit again ends right as you smash back onto Earths surface.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The strength of gravity depends on the mass of both gravitating objects. You are presumably much, much lighter than the Moon, so it's not impossible for you to overcome the much weaker force of gravity with your legs and jump.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similarly, why does The Moon's gravity affect the tides but won't, for example, cause a paperclip to slide across a desk?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It does cause a paperclip to move towards it. However, it also makes the desk, and the building you're in, to move towards it by approximately the same amount, so they stay fixed relative to each other. The displacement distance technically depends on how close the object is to the Moon, but on the small scale that you're talking about the difference between the desk and the paperclip would be minuscule and unnoticeable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are thinking of gravity like it's a giant muscular arm pulling at something. If that was the case, pulling a massive object would have less of an impact than pulling something light. If that's how gravity worked, the force to keep the moon in orbit would flatten everyone in Earth. </p>
<p>In reality, Gravity is just a constant speed change. It accelerates all objects who are the same distance from the center at the exact same rate. If you shoot a bullet straight up in the air, it might leave the barrel at a speed of 700 meters per second. It's speed relative to you will decelerate to 690 meters per second by the second second. 10 seconds in, that's 600 meters per second now. In reality, the bullet slows down a lot faster because of air resistance, but, in a vacuum, a 5 ton boulder and a a bullet weighing a fraction of an ounce would decelerate at the same speed. </p>
<p>The reason for this is that Gravity isn't necessarily a force. We calculate it as such because it behaves like one, but that's just a short cut. Gravity alters space time so that the path of the object is altered. This is why the mass of the object is irrelevant (I mean it matters because the object also has gravity which also alters space time, but those are overcomplications).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
