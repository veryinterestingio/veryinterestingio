		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some stuff does separate a bit, like Yoohoo. Things that don't separate are because the ingredients are either completely in solution (like sugar dissolved in milk or water) or because the ingredients make a stable suspension when you get them evenly mixed (homogenized milk is stable because they stir the crap out of it).</p>
<p>Dissolving works because it's energetically favorable. Things like sugar and salt have parts of their molecules that have a slight charge imbalance. Water does too, so they like to stick to each other, kind of like little bar magnets. They'd rather hang out with the water than clump together on their own.</p>
<p>In the case of suspensions (colloids) you have things that don't want to mix, but you get them to because the thorough mixing breaks clumps. For the fat in milk, you stir until the fat ends up in tiny little spheres with water around them. The little clumps of fat want to stay together, and the water wants to stay together. To get the clumps of fat near to each other and start combining back into bigger clumps is a higher energy state, and in general, things want to stay at the lowest energy. It basically takes more energy to get the water (like little sticky magnets) out of the way that's keeping the fat separate.</p>
<p>EDIT: Someone mentioned emulsifiers, which I totally spaced on. That's another thing that may keep a mixture together. Emulsifiers are ingredients that allows mixtures of polar and non-polar ingredients to stay together. An example would be water (polar) and oil (non-polar). Emulsifiers have one end that sticks to polar molecules and another end that sticks to non-polar molecules, so they sort of play matchmaker. Common examples for foods and beverages are egg yolk, mustard, soy lecithin, and various esters.</p>
<p>EDIT2: In my enthusiam for ELI5'ing it I described homogenization as just 'stirring'. While some stuff can remain pretty stable by stirring hard (with like a blender or something), in practice, it works better if you go super saiyan on breaking up the clumps you want to remain in suspension with a more specialized device. As other commentors pointed out, milk is homogenized by forcing it through a small opening under high pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the seperation between oil and water is due to differing polarity of the molecules: water is very polar, oil is quite non-polar and thus they seek to minimize contact ergo seperation. Soda and coffee drinks usually contain stuff like sugar and caffeine and other small organic molecules contained lots of Oxygens and Nitrogens that will make them fairly polar as well, meaning they will stay in solution in water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most drinks are a mixture of things. Some things are really small, like a sugar molecule. Those things are usual &quot;dissolved&quot; or &quot;in solution&quot;, meaning that sugar likes to hang out with water molecules more than other sugar molecules.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Other things are bigger, like milk proteins, bits of chocolate, or tiny balls of fat. Then it'ss called a &quot;suspension&quot;. These can settle over time, but you shake it up, it's usually a good mix. Suspensions are stable for different reasons than above, but the idea is the same. Somethings we need to add things that are called &quot;surfactants&quot; to make a suspension stable. Think of these as special molecules with one end suited to your suspended particle, and other end compatible with water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
