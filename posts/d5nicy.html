		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Services like Spotify, Tidal, Deezer, YouTube Music, Apple Music, etc. seem to have overlapping catalogues (for the most part) while video streaming services like Netflix, HBO Now, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, etc. seem to have a lot less overlap and much more exclusive content. To the point where having exclusive access to certain shows becomes a selling point for the service. Why is that? Is the copyright law different for music and video?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Historical reasons. Video streaming services inherited the TV model, where services/channels would compete for exclusive rights to broadcast a series, or invest in producing their own. Whereas audio streaming services have inherited the radio model, where every station acquires rights to a wide catalogue of songs (sometimes focused on specific genres, time periods, popularity etc depending on the station).</p>
<p>As for why this has historically been the case, I couldn't say for sure, but I suspect it's something to do with the fact that songs are only a few minutes long and listened to in isolation, whereas TV series are 20-40 minute episodes and require a long-term investment from the viewer.</p>
<p>Copyright laws aren't different for music and video, but certainly the business models built around licensing out those media have evolved differently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All of these answers are sort of correct. It’s actually all about who holds the rights for performance (which is what streaming is considered under the law).</p>
<p>For video, production companies - basically whoever made the originals- own the rights.</p>
<p>For music it’s more complicated. </p>
<p>Video performance is a showing - a movie theater or a tv airing, or a stream. If I’m on a stage acting out a movie, that’s not a performance of that video (I may be performing the script, but I’m not performing the MOVIE).</p>
<p>For music, if I cover a song in a bar with my guitar, that’s a performance, just like a stream or a playing in a tv show, etc. </p>
<p>And to deal with that, the music industry has organized rights clearinghouses. These are organizations that offer the rights to big catalogs of songs to all types of buyers - music venues pay for rights, as do streaming services. It’s a flat fee for the whole catalog for most uses, not a per song fee in most cases.</p>
<p>The two big clearinghouses are called ASCAP and BMI, and the nearly all songs are licensed through them. There are some exceptions, like that Taylor swift album for which she withheld the rights, but for most artists that’s not really an option (for several reasons that aren’t worth explaining here).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This might get deleted because it's a partial answer but here is what i know.  The big difference is that musicians get paid on a per play basis by the music streaming services.  Whereas video streaming services pay for the content up front.... </p>
<p>Part of the reason for that is that they are competing against the cable networks who've been buying their content like that for many years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rights holders charge more for exclusive rights. Streaming services need to decide if they want to pay extra for exclusivity. That decision depends on people’s habits. While people might decide whether or not to get Netflix based on a few series or certain movies they probably won’t let a certain musician change their streaming service. </p>
<p>Music is often in the back ground. If you really want a certain song or album you probably buy it from iTunes. Even if you don’t buy it you probably hear the song on the radio or YouTube. You at least know the song. On the other hand buying a tv show is much more expensive and if you don’t have access you won’t see it at all so you may actually subscribe for access.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’d say because the rights to the master recordings are pretty much owned by the same three companies- UMG, Sony, and Warner, the ‘major labels.’  So there isn’t much diversity in content available. With television, my understanding is there is more variety in ownership, more complexity. Also, music streaming companies aren’t producing music, they are just a platform, while Netflix etc produce their own shows.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
