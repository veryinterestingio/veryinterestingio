		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's two parts to this.  Well, probably a lot more than two, but we're ELI5ish here.</p>
<p>First, you eat the pill.  It gets broken down in your stomach and intestine, just like regular food.  Food has nutrients that get broken down into base chemicals, and absorbed into the bloodstream.  Ibuprophen, and similar drugs, break down into base chemicals just like food.  But these chemicals are special.  Let's call our chemical Mac.  Mac likes to bind to other enzymes in your bloodstream, including one we'll call Charlie.  Charlie likes to hang out with a special enzyme named Frank.  Frank and Charlie together are bad news, and cause inflammation.  But if Charlie is hanging out with Mac, Frank can't join the fun.   </p>
<p>Now, side track, what is inflammation?  It's when things swell up.  That doesn't necessarily hurt on it's own, but if there is nowhere for the swelling to go, because say, you've got a bone or some skin there, we get pain.</p>
<p>Back to the Charlie and Mac.  Now that they are hanging out, and Frank can't join the party, we don't get inflammation.  Without the inflammation, we don't have pain.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is an incredibly high level and basic description, but the gist is, ibuprofen and other similar over-the-counter painkillers block the production of a chemical that ultimately leads to pain.  Less of the chemcial, less of the pain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 2 basic kinds of pain killers. Anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen and analgesics such as morphine. They relieve pain in different ways.</p>
<p>Anti-inflammatories,  as the name suggests, reduces inflammation. They attack the pain at the source. You have a swollen knee, take ibuprofen, it reduces swelling, pain is relieved.</p>
<p>Analgesics work on the nervous system to reduce the feeling of pain. It basically comes in and tells your brain not to worry about the pain. The pain doesn’t actually go anywhere, but your brain doesn’t really care. It’s like going to sleep when you are hungry; you are still hungry but you are asleep so you don’t notice it. </p>
<p>There are also things such as nerve blocks which are much more localized. They block a specific nerve / set of nerves in a specific location. As such, you wouldn’t feel any pain past the block. Epidurals/ spinal blocks would fit in here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Should you still take anti-inflammatories when you can handle the pain?</p>
<p>Does inflammation cause other problems? </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ibuprofen is an anti inflammatory that works by reducing swelling and inflammation in tissues like muscle. It doesn't deaden your response to pain so much as it helps remove the cause of the pain. The pressure from swollen tissue triggers pain receptors and is the cause of much of the soreness and pain from soft tissue injuries like sprains, bruises, or even tooth aches. </p>
<p>Contrast that with an analgesic painkiller like acetaminophen which doesn't do much to stop the cause of the pain, but instead reduces the activation and signalling of pain through the nerves. IE it doesn't fix the problem, it masks the pain of it. </p>
<p>Which pain killer class works best, greatly depends on the source of the pain. </p>
<p>I am not a doctor and this isn't medical advice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
