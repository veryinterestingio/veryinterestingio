		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer? You don't. </p>
<p>Your body can store some vitamins, and synthesize others.</p>
<p>Most food, especially those in the &quot;healthy&quot; category, have a variety of vitamins, usually more than you need.</p>
<p>Even foods that are &quot;unhealthy&quot; contain small amounts of nutrients. </p>
<p>If you have ever eaten a food that contains a large amount of a vitamin, your body can do without it for a surprising long time. </p>
<p>Sailors that have zero fresh fruit intake survive for months before getting scurvy, even though vitamin C can't be made by humans, and isn't stored in the body for long.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you live in an industrialized society, basic foods are fortified with necessary vitamins. You’re right to wonder how we get them all - people didn’t for a long time and developed diseases like goiters in result. Now things like salt, flour, cornmeal, baby formula, etc. have these vitamins artificially added to keep us healthy without changing our diets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Starting in the 1920s when iodine was added to salt, various essential nutrients have been added to common foodstuffs over the twentieth century that have virtually eliminated nutrient deficiencies in the United States.

<p>To keep it short and simple, chances are you won't be meeting your needs for all vitamins and minerals on a daily basis. That said, having a balanced diet that consists of a wide variety of different foods from different food groups ensures that you get a little bit of everything during meals. On top of that, foods are also fortified with nutrients to prevent any vitamin deficiencies, so most people don't really have to worry about it unless you have some sort of underlying medical condition that might put them at risk for developing a deficiency.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
