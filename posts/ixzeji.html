		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>i have 2 points to make,</p>
<p>1) In general, a cold feels shit, because of mucus, inflamed throat and bacteria/virus causing damage there</p>
<p>in the morning, you slept, and you usually have more dry throat than normal, something that resolves as the day goes on.</p>
<p>same with mucus, etc that accumulates during night: you flush it with food, drinks, swallowing.</p>
<p>2)
In general, i am always BETTER in the morning, and WORSE in the night. Now this is interesting;
Cortisol is a stress hormone that inhibits your immune system, which is acually for the.most part, the sole CAUSE of your symptoms. An active immune system in your airways will release mediators such as leukotrienes, prostaglandins, which stimulates nerve endings to cause</p>
<ul>
<li>Pain</li>
<li>Swelling</li>
<li>Hot sensation</li>
</ul>
<p>So, cortisol as a hormone will prevent this from happening.
this is why you can get cortisol injection in joints to reduce arthritis.</p>
<p>now:
Cortisol as a stress hormone, reaches its highest levels in the morning, thus inhibiting your immune system in a bigger fashion, leading to fewer symptoms.
Cortisol levels go down throughout the day and is lowest in the night, which gives your immune systen more room to play and cause inflammation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, mornings are due to mucus shifting about when you sleep.  During the day, you blow your nose or sniff to move stuff.  And night, gravity does what it does best!
This can cause your nasal cavities to fill up and become blocked.  This forces you to breathe through your mouth, which dries out your throat and makes it irritated.*  Another thing that can happen is that the nasal dripping can lead to mucus, or phlegm, settling on your vocal folds, giving you a horribly gravelly voice!</p>
<p>As for night time, I suspect it's just because you're worn out by that point.  You usually feel tired, and the cold just makes it worse.  Plus, your diaphragm has been working all day to cough, sneeze, sniff and blow.  It needs a rest!</p>
<p>I say this, speaking from both past and present experience.  I'm about to go take a nasal spray, then drink some honey and lemon.  It's a bit early here for me to add whisky!</p>
<p>*This is one of the main reasons we breathe through our noses.  They help to moisten the air, which is better for our throats and lungs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit: I read the question wrong. Here's a better answer</p>
<p>You've been up all day. Staying awake drains much of your body. You use more energy, your brain acquires more toxins that need to be flushed, your immune system takes a toll, you have a higher heart rate, your body uses more chemical reactions for ATP production and transport and DNA repair.</p>
<p>All that. All that on top of being sick. It's no wonder you're tired by nighttime.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
