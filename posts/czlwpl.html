		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain is composed of different parts that operate differently and respond to different stimuli, but can often control the same things.  The part that does the thinking, the prefrontal cortex, is considered one piece of evolutionary development that has given humans an edge over many others species.  It is however built upon and added to older and more primitive parts of the brain that control more base/essential functions.  </p>
<p>One black and white example of this is the breathing reflex.  You don’t typically think about breathing because a different part of your brain (the medulla oblongata) is primarily responsible for it.  However, if you do think about it you can hold your breath.  This is your prefrontal cortex temporarily usurping control from the medulla oblongata.  However, after an extended period of time you’ll find that despite your best efforts you cannot make yourself continue to hold your breath.  This is because as CO2 levels rise in your blood the medulla oblongata is even more motivated to make you breath.  As a more primitive and evolutionarily older part of the brain it can essentially usurp control of your lungs from the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>Facial expressions are similar.  Body language, of which facial expressions are a large part, evolved far before oral and written language.   You seldom make a conscious effort to control your facial expressions during a conversation because other parts of your brain are doing this for you.  Though I can’t claim to know exactly which parts of the brain are responsible for body language and facial expressions it is a comparatively primitive brain function that came into being before the prefrontal cortex in humans became so prominent.  The end result being that the prefrontal cortex may often share control over facial expressions and responses such as laughing with these other parts of the brain.  These other parts of the brain can make your face do things without you thinking about it, and regularly do.</p>
<p>TL;DR:   When you think about making/not making certain facial expressions, that is happening in your prefrontal cortex, where your thoughts occur.  Other parts of your brain however will often have some degree of control over you facial muscles as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
