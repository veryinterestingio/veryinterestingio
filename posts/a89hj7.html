		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So this is a project I saw in a conference today, and with my limited knowledge of high school physics I thought this felt completely bullshit.
The Idea was a backpack with magnets that carry the stuff inside it so you don't have to.
But according to Newton's first law, isn't the person carrying the backpack still feeling the weight of what's inside + the weight of the magnets?</p>
<p>Edit: So this blew up way more than I expected, I was just asking a regular question so let's clarify some points:</p>
<p>1- The goal of the course was not marketing a product, but creating an innovating and realisable product, and hopefully, encourage the winners to pursue the idea by starting a business later.
2- As many have pointed out this could have the good effect of diminishing pressure on the back by acting like a suspension when books are kinda moving when you are walking, but this wasn't what they wanted it to be, not that it really matters, but just to make it clear for people that are asking.</p></div></div>

<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lightningpacks/hoverglide-worlds-first-floating-backpack" target="_blank">Kickstarter - Floating Backpack</a></p>
<p>While you will always feel the <em>static load</em> of any suspended weight through the supporting base, it's relatively easy to eliminate most or all of the <em>dynamic loads</em> generated while it's in motion through the use of floating or flexible designs. </p>
<p>Basically, you have to carry the total pack weight but you <em>don't</em> have to feel it jerking up and down on your back while walking or running. The idea is very similar to how cars rely on shocks (large springs) to reduce the impact of hitting bumps in the road, or how guns can reduce the recoil from firing a bullet using internal springs and weights.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think I've read something about this before. You won't feel the weight any less with this magic backpack, but, it is supposed to reduce the dynamic load every time you take a step.</p>
<p>When you take a step, you lift the load in the backpack ever so slightly. When you swing forward to step onto the foot you just placed, the load drops back down. In a normal backpack, that dropped weight adds a little extra downward kinetic force, which you have to compensate for. With the magic backpack, the magnetically suspended load in the backpack is supposed to compress like a shock absorber and be repelled back up by the magnetic repulsion.</p>
<p>Since the magnetic block would also be pushed down by some fraction of the force, the reduction is limited, but, as I understand it, magnets don't retain their magnetic magic forever, so, some tiny bit of the downward kinetic energy is re-emitted as entropic loss of magnetic magic, thus reducing the amount of kinetic energy your legs have to absorb.</p>
<p>Or so I understand it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The only thing the magnets could ACTUALLY achieve in terms of &quot;reduced weight&quot; is the reduced perception of load because they keep the load magnetically suspended, therefore acting as shock absorbers. For the rest, it's gonna weigh just the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Of course you'd feel combined weight. Magnetism isnt anti gravity. However this idea is good for reducing the jerks in a backpack. It would be really good for military personnel who carry large loads in their backpacks and would need to sprint from time to time. Something like this magnetic suspension can reduces the unbalanced forces from cramping up their shoulders and back muscles. Iirc there's already a <a href="https://youtu.be/jqzbU6OTVUg" target="_blank">floating backpack</a> design that has been developed but not yet commercially available.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
