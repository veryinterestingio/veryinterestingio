		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The exact effect of alcohol in the brain to cause drunkenness is not fully known, but it is known that alcohol interacts with brain receptors (most strongly called the ones called GABA receptors) and when these GABA receptors fire there are certain regions in the brain that get 'slowed down' and their activity gets decreased. Some of these areas are the frontal lobes when (among other things) control socially-appropriate behaviors which is why people are prone to acting like idiots when drunk, as well as the cerebellum which controls coordination, which is why you should never drive when drunk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Along with the chemical explanations others have mentioned, in layman’s terms, The effects of alcohol prevent your brain from functioning at full speed and strength. Your brain interprets the world around you using all of your senses to create one view of the world you interact with, but with alcohol it has trouble. For example your balance is affected when you can’t interpret your surroundings, your ability to control the muscles you use to speak and use your fine motor skills causes slurred speech and clumsiness, you see double because your brain is seeing from both eyes without interpreting the images into one view for us like it would sober.</p>
<p>Additionally, this can cause massive brain damage to alcoholics who try to quit cold turkey after many years of intense drinking. The brain can’t handle the sudden increase in productivity that it was previously denied. I’ve been sober for 2.5 years now and I experienced mild hallucinations during my first night of withdrawals.</p>
<p>Your brain when tipsy will also interpret any dizziness as having been poisoned which causes the brain to initiate vomiting to expel whatever was ingested. It’s the same reaction your body has to anything you consume that may affect you this way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Layman's explanation... Your nervous system has an accelerator and a brake. Alcohol tends to crudely hit the brake through GABA receptors (senses slow down, there a calming effect, later you piss/poop, pass out). While hitting the brake you are less inhibited and sometimes emotions will come out that would otherwise be better controlled. Aggressivenes can occur as blood alcohol level decease after a high spike and the calming brake effect is dimishing. </p>
<p>In people that are chronic alcoholics their nervous system is always operating with that brake on and they may function normally by compensating and adapting physiologically. When they suddenly stop drinking their nervous system accelerates and they withdraw with everything headed towards excitation (fast heart rate, tremors, racing thoughts, seizures and possibly death). </p>
<p>It should be said that alcohol is neurotoxic. It's a poison and the only safety is that we limit the amount we are exposed to it. It's effects on aging the brain is understated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Idk about drunkness but i know why everything spins when you’re drunk. The vestibular system in your inner ears controls balance and vision and how it works is simple. There’s a gel with tiny crystals inside it and hair cells. When your head moves the inertia of those crystals causes the hair cells to move, signaling motion. Alcohol makes that gel more liquidy so the crystals move more, thus you get dizzy and everything is turning. Fascinating</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
