		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm very much a clueless layman, but I'm learning about genetics for the first time. I don't mean this in any sort of combative way–the Human Genome Project had countless benefits that we can't possibly track, and I'd imagine $2.7 billion is a trifle compared to its broader impact. </p>
<p>My question is just narrowly about the way that genome sequencing has dropped rapidly in cost. Was it fundamentally necessary to first use these exorbitantly pricey methods, which provided the foundation for the future research which would make it affordable? Or are the two questions inherently separate: the Human Genome Project gave us a first, initial glimpse at our mapped out genome, and then a decade later separate technological developments would make that same task much cheaper (as is commonly the case in science and technology).</p>
<p>The &quot;could we have waited&quot; in the title is probably misleading–I really don't mean any sort of  value judgment (the project sounds enormously important), I purely mean &quot;could&quot; in a narrow hypothetical (not, &quot;would it have been a good idea to wait&quot;, which I highly doubt).</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cost of gene sequencing has dropped dramatically, but these two numbers are apples and oranges. The Human Genome Project &quot;mapped the genome&quot;. Meaning it created a &quot;reference genome&quot; that is roughly accurate for every human being on earth. It's like a scaffold upon which you can place any individual sequence you might read. </p>
<p>Today, you can take short reads of roughly a human genome-worth of DNA for less than $1000. That sequencing can tell you if the person has any small mutations. But without the reference genome, all that information would be worthless because you couldn't place all the little fragments of DNA where they sit on the larger genome.</p>
<p>Think of it like having a big jumble of small phrases that you know belong in a big epic novel. Your job is to tell us what page the phrase belongs on. HGP pieced together the whole novel for the first time, so now your job is much easier because you can just do a CRTL+F. </p>
<p>Today, people continue to assemble new reference genomes (e.g., new species) and reassemble the human genome to look for larger variations that don't agree with the original reference genomes created by the HGP and others. You typically can't do that for &lt;$1000. It could cost you tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars, depending on what tools you use and what accuracy you desire. </p>
<p>Tl;Dr: creating a new reference genome is much cheaper than it used to be and has certainly enabled by technology created in the course of the HGP and others. But still very very expensive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>100% we needed to do the expensive work to get to this stage. The publicly funded human genome project did two things. It made a map of where all the genes are and how they're arranged vs each other, and it got the sequences that made up those genes. </p>
<p>Craig Venter and his buddies ran a privately funded genome project at the same time that used a method called shotgun sequencing. Shotgun sequencing got lots of similar bits of sequence data (&quot;reads&quot;) from everywhere in the genome at once, but that data needed to be stitched together by computers for it to make any sense. They needed the mapping and sequencing data  from the publicly funded human genome project to be able to do that. It wouldn't have worked without it. </p>
<p>Fast forward to today, and &quot;Next Generation Sequencing&quot; (NGS). NGS was a huge step forward in efficiency and it's the main thing that makes whole genome sequencing so much cheaper than it used to be. It can get you a full genome of sequence data very quickly, but it again only gets short sequence &quot;reads&quot;, so it relies on having the full sequence of the human genome plus map to compare the short sequence to and see where they fit. </p>
<p>Basically the human genome project put a million piece (total guess) jigsaw puzzle together without the picture on the front of the box. That was slow and expensive to do. Now that we know what the puzzle should look like, a computer can solve the puzzle in basically no time at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer is no. Basically the people working on the Human genome project developed and advanced the technology while also proving that it was even possible! </p>
<p>A good analogy would be that it cost about $2.27 Billion for the Sputnik mission to get the first person into space and SpaceX rockets cost about 57 million to get into space. But without the basis for going to space SpaceX would seem impossible. </p>
<p>Basically, it’s always going to be more expensive to do something the first time because, well it’s the first time. But all the subsequent attempts get better as things get more mainstream. And things likely will only get cheaper, we can now analyze thousands of genes at once for extremely cheap using MicroArrays, look those up on YouTube they’re very good.</p>
<p>Random story about DNA sequencing (not sure how accurate this is but one of my college professors told me this). Evidently the guy who developed a way to speed up PCR (what let’s us sequence DNA really fast) did it while he was high looking at the 2 yellow lines in the middle of the road. And in his brain they were going together and separating and so he had the idea to, rather than have 1 copy of a sequence of DNA and trying to read it, just make a ton of copies so it’s easier to analyze.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What’s funny about this question is that the first sequencing of the human genome, even as expensive as it was, <em>was an absolute technological marvel</em>. The cost disparity makes it seem like we just brute-forced our way through it by throwing money at the problem, but not even two decades before it was completed it was seen as utterly impossible. It is a scientific accomplishment on the level of the moon landing.</p>
<p>The invention of PCR, without which genome sequencing most likely would not have been possible, was a revolutionary technique and nothing short of a stroke of bio-engineering genius. Its inventor, Kary Mullis, won a Nobel prize for it. He’s also a great case study in bat-shit crazy people sometimes having revolutionary ideas. </p>
<p>The cost savings just came with refinement along with economy of scale. Sequencing a human genome is only one small part of the DNA sequencing industry - it’s become a many-billion dollar endeavor that is used for all kinds of stuff, from human disease research to agricultural pollution assessments to even weird shit like tracking high-altitude inter-continent wind patterns. The increased scale is really what has allowed for economical high-throughout methods to be developed, in turn greatly reducing prices and allowing its entry into consumer markets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
