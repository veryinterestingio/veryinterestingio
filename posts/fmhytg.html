		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally, probably not very much, particularly for influenza A. </p>
<p>A lot of people think of influenza as a human virus. It kind of isn't. It's very much an animal virus. In humans, influenza tends to produce a rapid-onset, debilitating illness that tends to have the effect of reducing the spread as compared to if the virus behaved more like most cold viruses (rhinoviruses, non-SARS coronaviruses, etc.) Flu does mutate rapidly, but not fast enough to overcome the diverse and profound immunity across the human population to produce an epidemic every single year, as flu does. </p>
<p>As such there is (and must be for this pattern) a very large animal reservoir of &quot;experimental&quot; influenza that makes the actual spread among the human population less important than you would expect in the context of a mass quarantine. In particular, the human to swine route is a major source of ongoing seasonal influenza, and occasionally pandemic influenza. We pass our flu to swine, they mix it up and serve as a depot, then they pass it back to us. </p>
<p>There's a good chance this particular flu season could taper off, but we wouldn't necessarily expect next year to be very different. Until humans stop interacting closely with millions of flu-harboring animals, we will continue to have relatively severe seasonal flu.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Of course it will cause influenza cases to reduce. It all depends where in the world you are as well, here in the UK our winter is just over, so influenza cases were decreasing anyway. The number of flu cases will be seen in similar patterns each year as the virus mutates - the severity of the flu season is dependant on the specific strain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
