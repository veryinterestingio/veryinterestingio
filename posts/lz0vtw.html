		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has more to do with how they're raised. Ducks and chicks will often follow their mother at a young age, and being a bright color makes  it easier for their mother to find them. Wild birds, especially those that fly, usually stay in their nest until they're old enough to be on their own. Plus, yellow colors appear more often in domesticated birds. Wild chicks, especially ducks, are more drab colored.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The bright yellow chicks are mainly a thing for domestic birds. Most of their wild relatives are a lot more drab and cryptically colored. Googling wild ducklings or the chicks of wild Hawaiian chickens shows  a lot of brown, splotchy patterns.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Note: not an ornithologist but a former poultry farmer. There's a surprising amount of color use in raising poultry, from the use of red to stimulate feeding, reproduction, etc. So take this with a grain of salt - I did a bit of Googling and it appears to be in order. Willing to be corrected, of course. </p>
<p>Recall that we see &quot;walking yellow highlighters&quot; but humans have an astonishing diversity of color distinction in our vision. Primates have 3 (color) photoreceptors (red, yellow &amp; blue), so we lucked out in that regard. </p>
<p>Wild canids, for example are generally scent hunters. They don't have the visual color range we do. More like a yellow, greenish, blue range. </p>
<p>Birds have the same three receptors we have, but also see a much broader spectrum - into the ultraviolet range.  Some raptors have six photoreceptors that allow them to be active in dim light, double <strong>cones</strong> that <strong>are</strong> thought to mediate achromatic discrimination, and four types of single <strong>cones</strong> mediating color vision.</p>
<p>So what does this mean? Bright yellow isn't so bright to different species in the Animal Kingdom. Bright yellow is actually pretty drab to many predators and can be nearly indistinct from red and similar to green for many others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
