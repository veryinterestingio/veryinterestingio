		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Knots are actually caused by the fascia, basically a lining of fibers over all your muscles and organs etc. When you have a knot the fibers can get kinda bunched up on themselves, which is what you feel when you touch one. Massaging serves to relax and stretch out those bunches and flatten the fascia again, which also means it won't be pulling on your muscles in a funny way and will help your muscles feel better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Muscles can change in many ways (lengthen, shorten, contract, relax, grow, atrophy) according to Davis' Law of Soft Tissue Adaption, which states that muscles change based on what happens to them. If you use a muscle too much, it can get &quot;stuck&quot; in a partially contracted state all the time and refuse to let go.</p>
<p>Muscles are kind of weird as far as having knots versus the entire muscle. For instance, some muscles cross multiple joints and therefore have multiple actions (biceps crosses both the shoulder and elbow joint) and because of that, contracting across the shoulder and elbow will affect those different parts of the muscle differently. Knots happen when only a small part of the muscle gets stuck instead of the whole thing.</p>
<p>Massage is a very specific and localized stretch for the muscle. By stretching the muscle (or knotty part of the muscle) long enough, the muscle adapts to the tension placed on it (Davis' Law) and stops contracting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry that this is not a &quot;like you're 5&quot; explanation, but this issue (like most things having to do with pain, injury, or physiology) is complicated and I can't give that simple of an explanation personally.  But I'm seeing lots of people produce answers that are blatantly incorrect.  </p>
<p>Instead of going and asking them for evidence about fascia, or muscle tightness, or whatever this week's unproven explanation that's used as justification for unvalidated physical therapy interventions (like acupuncture, massage therapy, foam rolling, myofascial release etc. ), I thought I'd just provide an article that gives some insight into this issue from an expert.  You may find his experience interesting, or it may be more than you care to read, which would be fair.  Not everyone cares about this stuff as much as I do.  But suffice it to say, the human body is very complicated and there is not always a clear physiological or biological explanation for phenomena that are influenced by psychology and environment.  This is why the current research has embraced the &quot;Bio-psycho-social&quot; perspective on pain, and has all but abandoned a pure biomedical approach.</p>
<p>Here's the article: <a href="https://www.painscience.com/articles/trigger-point-doubts.php" target="_blank">https://www.painscience.com/articles/trigger-point-doubts.php</a></p>
<p>This website has lots of good articles about many things having to do with pain and injury.  If you find yourself intrigued I'd recommend browsing it when you have a question about something in particular.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
