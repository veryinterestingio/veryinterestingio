		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At least for Blue whales they lunge feed and their mouth expands as it gets filled with water. Once their mouth is full they try to filter away as much water as possible by expelling it out back out of their mouth. Blue whale have baleen plates which kinda works like a sieve, keeping the food inside while letting the water pass through. They try to swallow as little water as possible so their kidneys have to work less dealing with the salt water. </p>
<p>For breathing they have a completely separate system that doesn't really share anything with how they eat so they can breath independently from eating. However because they live underwater whales have evolved a different way of  controlling their breathing. Humans have a central respiratory rhythm which controls our breathing, we can voluntarily choose to breath manually by suppressing the signal but if we don't breathe for a long time we have a primitive neural circuit that ignores higher brain areas and just tells your muscles to breathe even though you don't want to. This is why a person drowning will always end up swallowing water. </p>
<p>Whales don't work this way. Whales are basically always breathing manually. They will swim to the surface and then decide they want to take a breath. I think it's technically possible for whales to inhale water if they forcefully inhale underwater. It's extremely rare because it's similar to a person choosing to drink bleach, it's not something someone would ever actually do on their own. Many whales have just suffocated underwater without even having tried to take a breath. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Note the trachea (air tube) lies underneath the esophagous (food tube) and opens into it through the larynx.  Then, at the roof of the mouth, behind the soft palate, there's another opening connecting to the nasal sinuses and from there to the nostrils.  Because of this, the paths of air and water cross through a region known as the pharynx..however in most animals this area is pretty small and the epiglottis is right next to the soft palate.  Normally, food is prevented from going down the trachea by the epiglottis.  But if this system fails, it's possible to choke on food going &quot;down the wrong pipe.&quot;  Now, this is actually quite rare in most mammals, not just dolphins and whales.  Humans are much more likely to choke on their food than other species...why?  Our larynx is <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/h5MUV.jpg" target="_blank">much lower</a> in our throat than most <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1088793/" target="_blank">but not all</a> other mammals.   In other mammals, the top of the larynx actually projects up toward the soft palate. All this can be moved around of course, it's not a solid or permanent connection (which is why the air can also be directed through the mouth) but it makes it much harder for animals to choke as opposed to people, who have the opening to the larynx way down in the throat where food can more easily fall down into it.  Why do we have such a low larynx?  <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(08\)00371-0.pdf" target="_blank">It lets us talk</a>. </p>
<p>So what about dolphins?  Well, they take things further, making a semi-permanent connection between larynx and nasal cavity through a structure called a goosebeak <a href="http://medicalart.johnshopkins.edu/wp-content/uploads/BK_Dolphin.jpg" target="_blank">good diagram here</a> and another <a href="https://ai2-s2-public.s3.amazonaws.com/figures/2017-08-08/030fc1231a2a1ab62c4bad53b9fbfb0d2f9e9c7e/8-Figure3-1.png" target="_blank">here</a>.  Instead of just being located high in the pharynx, like in most mammals, the structure actually sticks all the way up into the nasal cavity through the opening in the back of the soft palate, which seals around it with a sphincter.  This basically seals off the air tube from the food tube, making it nigh impossible for water to go down the wrong pipe.</p>
<p>But of course there are exceptions, like <a href="https://www.hakaimagazine.com/news/scientists-discover-mouth-breathing-dolphin/" target="_blank">this mouth breathing dolphin</a>.  Humpback whales also seem to be able to move this structure and emit air into the mouth, allowing them to produce their famous bubblenets  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17516445" target="_blank">link</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In humans, your &quot;air tube&quot; and your &quot;food tube&quot; are next to each other and there's a little flap (the epiglottis) that opens or closes depending on if we're breathing/talking or eating/drinking. Sometimes we mess it up a little and we either swallow some air, or inhale some food/liquid. </p>
<p>In whales and dolphins, their esophagus is connected to their mouth, but they breathe through their blowholes on top of their heads (they can't breathe through their mouths like humans). There would literally be no way for them to accidentally inhale water/food and choke like humans can. </p>
<p>IIRC, there's a reflex that prevents the blowhole from opening while underwater, and this makes it extremely difficult for dolphins/whales to choke or drown. I suppose there might be a chance that while the blowhole is open, a drop of water might accidentally get inhaled, but I'm not sure that this has ever been explicitly observed, or if there's an adaptation that makes it a non-issue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dolphin tour guide here.   Yes, absolutely.   Happens all the time.  It is called “chuffing”.     If you get the chuff most on you, you will smell like fish for a week and nothing will get it off.  Had to shave my beard off a couple of time because we were down wind and one started chuffing.   Couldn’t get out of the way in time.  </p>
<p>I’ve got tons of videos of dolphin doing cool stuff.  I’ll see if I can find a chuffing video.  Stand by.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bd7zhy" target="_blank">scientist studying the human voice on a Brian Cox podcast</a> (Proff Sophie Scott, Cognitive Neurobiology, University College London), the organ we use for speech originally evolved in mammals to prevent things going down the wrong pipe, and it was a cost of our voice that we can choke. For that reason, I would say that only animals with speech (obviously not operationally comparable to us, just the articulated muscle structures that enable it at all, like chimps) can have that happen. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
