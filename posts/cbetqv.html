		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most drugs that cause cardiovascular stress are vasoconstrictors. Simply put, this means they tighten your blood vessels causing your heart to work harder to deliver a normal amount of blood.
Your body sees your heart working harder and secretes hormones to help (which causes part of the &quot;high&quot; associated with the drug).
But it's the equivalent of blowing through a tiny straw. It puts unnecessary stress on the heart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Exercise is good if done correctly. You can over exercise which can be detrimental to your system. You exercise and then let your body recover by providing it with nutrition and rest. If you are a smoker, you are constantly stressing your CV system which may lead to sustained high blood pressure and/or hardening of the arteries. Your body never gets a break.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding to what others have said already:</p>
<p>Chemically induced stress is still a stress. Stresshormones are produced when you are in a stress situation, along with other such signaling chemicals that produce the high. But our body is not affected overall, vital organs and functions can be turned down while some are turned up. While excercising, our bodies go into a mode where stress hormones are beneficial, adrenaline is needed and used, muscles are working, metabolism changes everywhere. Lactic acid and other metabolic byproducts are handled more efficiently, gut changes the way it works. When you sit stressed, your body is not in a mode where it will take care of those byproducts. You most likely are not drawing breath efficiently enough; most of your body works just fine with normal breathing (another extreme is hyperventilating for hours, which is not good either), our body will measure blood CO2 and regulate breathing that way.</p>
<p>Someone here used an analogy of revving the engine while in neutral. This is very good comparison, if we make heat to be metabolic byproducts: your engine is overheating, no air flow goes thru the radiators. We have some electric fans that make sure our engine doesn't blow up but it'll be overtasked, engine will still be too hot.</p>
<p>Combine this with another top comment: smaller pipes for the engine coolant so the pumps have to work harder too, getting hot in the process themselves.</p>
<p>This is, imho, the reason why people die from stress.. In my anecdotal experience being an old speed junkie: very high stress is exactly the same... I've used to work in high stress, in live broadcast and live events in general that are timed by +-1s accuracy. The adrenaline rush before and during the show feels about the same, except that there are no hallucinations. Body almost shuts down of digesting anything, you can go hours with just adrenaline coursing thru the veins (i've now quit working in that field, i developed some kind of sensitivity to adrenaline, so now i eat beta blockers so i don't get a heart attack from reaching for a coffee mug and hitting the rim, almost splashing some coffee on the table. By body doesn't know how to regulate that response anymore and treats that as the same as i was being mugged. Makes interesting life when slight stupid scares are like Freddie Krueger appears in the mirror..).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you damage your arteries Your heart pumps harder to overcome higher pressures. This makes the heart muscle grow so much that the ventricles get smaller and the muscle stops being supplied properly with blood When you do excersize your total peripheral resistance <em>decreases</em>. Your heart does more work but in a more balanced environment. Your heart gets bigger, but in a way that doesn't constrict ventricles.</p>
<p>This is based on the formula:
pressure * radius/ 2 thickness = tension.<br />
The heart reduces tension by increasing thickness. Sports do not cause as much Pressure change, this less tension than drugs do. Bigger heart, yes, but equally more efficient.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
