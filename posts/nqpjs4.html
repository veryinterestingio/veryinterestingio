Debt doesn’t get passed on to next of kin. The only exception is stuff that you may have co-signed for them as it’s technically your debt too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on jurisdiction and the nature of the debt.</p>
<p>Any secured debts (eg loans secured on the house or car) will see the creditors come and claim their security during probate (the process of administering the estate). Any heirs can settle the debts if they want to keep the car/house/farm/whatever.</p>
<p>If there is money left over once secured creditors get their cut then unsecured creditors might make claims on the remaining estate - this is stuff like credit card debt. Same as above - if any heirs want to take possession of the asset (house/car/whatever) they can settle the debts.</p>
<p>If the debt exceeds the value of the estate then it <strong>should</strong> get written off by the creditors as a loss. This is a risk they take. But they, or a collections agency they’ve sold the debt to, might try to get heirs to take on this debt.</p>
<p><strong>NEVER</strong> agree to pay a single cent of your own money to settle a deceased relatives debt that isn’t settled by the estate. In a lot of places agreeing to make even a single payment of a single cent can be taken as acceptance of responsibility for the debt and you’ll be on the hook for the entire balance.</p>
<p>Collection agencies know this and will often try to guilt family members into making a “token payment” because that’ll reactivate the debt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When a person dies, all of their property gets accounted for and becomes the deceased person's estate.  Any outstanding debt then becomes claims against the estate.  The process for figuring out the contents and value of the deceased's estate, instructions in any will, collecting any insurance payouts, and paying off outstanding debts is called probate.</p>
<p>The simple answer is that outstanding debt gets paid out of the estate, and anything leftover gets passed down to the deceased's heirs.  If the debt is more than the value of the estate, the debtors get as much as the estate has and then any remaining debt is voided.  Heirs and/or descendants aren't responsible for any remaining debt.</p>
<p>There may be circumstances in which it makes sense for descendants to assume the debt; mostly when they wish to keep a piece of property such as assuming the mortgage payments on a house because the descendants want to keep the house.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
