		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>True ELI5: In order for something to move from hot to cold, there has to be something for the hot to move TO.</p>
<p>Have you ever touched a big piece of metal on a cold day and felt how cold it is compared to the air? That's because the metal has a lot of stuff in it for the heat from your hand to move to, and the air around you doesn't have as much stuff (but it still has some, just a lot less than the metal).</p>
<p>Space, on the other hand, is very, very empty. There just isn't that much stuff for the hot to move into. So, while it may be very cold in outer space, it won't cool you down very quickly at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Terrible cold in space is mostly a myth. </p>
<p>Yes, if you were in the shadow of an object (or very far from the sun), an object with no heating would get very cold - but it would do so very slowly. The reason is that space is a perfect insulator against all forms of heat transfer except radiation - and heat radiation is a very slow process at low temperatures. </p>
<p>The heat generation of a human would alone be sufficient to counteract heat loss. </p>
<p>Bigger problem is cooling - and space suit deal with this problem by having water cooling and an active heat exchanger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way a thermos flask works is that it has a layer of vacuum inside its walls. This means that heat transfers very slowly out of the flask, because heat radiates faster when it can go through matter. </p>
<p>So when you're in space, you're surrounded by vacuum. So it's actually very hard to heat to leave, and a big issue for space travel is how to vent heat properly so as not to boil your astronauts.</p>
<p>This also means that a human can survive in space longer than most people believe. The first thing that's going to kill you is suffocation (though the lack of pressure will injure you pretty severely). If you just bring a scuba mask and oxygen tank (assuming those work in space?) you'll be able to survive for a fair old while, though you will be hospitalised once you get rescued.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are three mechanisms for heat transfer: Conduction, Convection, and Radiation.</p>
<p>In normal human experience, conduction dominates. We're used to touching the cold thing and immediately feeling that it's cold or the hot thing and feeling that it's hot. There's not enough matter outside the space suit to conduct heat in or out of the suit, so it essentially doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Next, we have convection. When you turn on the HVAC, it's because the air in the room is one temperature and you want it to be another. The HVAC plant does this by heating or cooling a lot of air and then moving the conditioned air into your room and the objectionable air out. Again, we're not gonna be moving any air into or out of our space suit, so that doesn't matter.</p>
<p>All that's left is radiation, and by that, we mean infrared light, not RF/radio radiation or ionizing radiation that causes radiation poisoning. All of the light poring onto the space suit from the sun would very handily heat that side of the suit up to hundreds of degrees, save for one crucial fact, the space suit's white. The reflected color white, as we all know, is a reflection of <em>all</em> colors, that includes IR light from the sun. This helps the suit control how hot it gets while in direct sunlight. On the other hand, an astronaut working in the space station's shadow, while not getting any excess light radiation from the sun, it is always emitting its own IR radiation, which is, in fact, cooling the suit down.</p>
<p>However, radiation is the weakest of the three forms of heat transfer, so radiating its heat away into space happens very, very slowly. It's easily offset by heaters keeping the environment inside the space suit, and the astronaut herself, warm and comfortable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
