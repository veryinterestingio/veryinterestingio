		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All the comparisons of Delta COVID to chickenpox in terms of communicability made me wonder - if almost everyone gets chickenpox as a child and is then immune, how does it keep coming back? There must be a vector for it, I mean there has to be one kid who gets it and gives it to the rest - how do they come into contact with it if adults are basically immune? Does it just, like, exist in the air forever? How has it not been eradicated by herd immunity at this point? Would love an explanation for this.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answers I read in here are responding how the virus stays in a person's body, but I feel like OP's question is slightly different.  The question isn't necessarily why any given person might have a reoccurrence of a chickenpox  outbreak but under what conditions does a person transmit chickenpox to other people. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chickenpox/about/transmission.html" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/chickenpox/about/transmission.html</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>People with shingles can spread VZV to people who have never had chickenpox or never received the chickenpox vaccine. This can happen through direct contact with fluid from shingles rash blisters or through breathing in virus particles that come from the blisters. </p>
<p>It takes about 2 weeks (from 10 to 21 days) after exposure to a person with chickenpox or shingles for someone to develop chickenpox. If a vaccinated person gets the disease, they can still spread it to others </p>
<p>A person with chickenpox is considered contagious beginning 1 to 2 days before rash onset until all the chickenpox lesions have crusted (scabbed). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The part about vaccinated people being able to spread it is interesting and might be part of the explanation for OP's question.</p>
<p>Edit: This is an important additon: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vaccinated people who get chickenpox may develop lesions that do not crust.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edit: The key thing in transmitting is developing a rash with fluid from chickenpox or shingles. </p>
<p>Edit: Ignore the next paragraph </p>
<p><del>I was trying to find sources that would say whether or not a person who has had chickenpox can later still transmit it if they come into contact with someone else with it. But I didn't find anything that addressed it.</del> </p>
<p>I will add that the vaccine has reduced cases significantly. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/varicella.html" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/varicella.html</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The incidence of varicella, as well as varicella-related hospitalizations, has decreased significantly since implementation of the national varicella vaccination program in 1996. Overall, varicella incidence declined an average of 97% from prevaccine years (from 1993–1995 to 2013–2014) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edit: I re-read some of the other answers and they do address how the reoccurrence in a person could make a person contagious again. I don't think my answer conflicts with that, but just adds more info.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've met 2 people who have had chickenpox twice; my own son, and a patient during my first summer as a doctor.</p>
<p>The patient had something that resembled chickenpox, but had already had it when younger. I had never had chicken pox, but I caught it from her (which confirmed the diagnosis 2 weeks later...). I was supposed to buy the vaccine with my first paycheck as in med school it was confirmed that I was seronegative for it, but this got me first.</p>
<p>As soon as the blisters started appearing and I developed a fever, I started antivirals and had a very mild form of it. My son caught it from me, had it very mild. A few years later, my daughter got it from somewhere, and my son got to have it again, again quite mild.</p>
<p>I have heard of many more times this has happened, so I guess it's not as rare as people think.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to point out that the virus that causes chickenpox is called Herpes Zoster. It's a herpes virus, just like the viruses that cause cold sores and genital herpes. Just like the other Herpes viruses, it doesn't fully go away after you've fought it off the first time.</p>
<p>Shingles isn't caused by a reinfection, but the virus lying dormant in your body and reemerging decades later. Just like how cold sores and genital herpes reemerge over and over again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
