		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll start by saying that we actually don't know if this is a new human species or not. The authors who found this fossil argue that it is because:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A combination of primitive and derived features in the Harbin cranium establishes a good set of diagnostic features that were used to define a new Homo species.&quot; via Shao et al: <a href="https://www.cell.com/the-innovation/fulltext/S2666-6758(21)00056-4" target="_blank">https://www.cell.com/the-innovation/fulltext/S2666-6758(21)00056-4</a>, published yesterday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, there are certain features that tend to be specifically diagnostic of species difference when we look at hominids. Things like brain size, face length, brow size, tooth differences, cheek bone size, etc. The reason we look at these things is because they tend to be variable between species, but fairly consistent within species. And, even in cases where one or more of these traits is variable (e.g., a baby born with microcephaly), all the concomitant traits probably won't change much. For example, the authors note that this fossil has a mix of features that are commonly seen in more human-like hominids, and those more common in &quot;primitive&quot; hominids:</p>
<p>Like humans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;large cranial capacity, short face, and small check bones&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More &quot;primitive:&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;low vault, strong browridges, large molars, and alveolar prognathism&quot; via Ni et al: <a href="https://www.cell.com/the-innovation/fulltext/S2666-6758(21)00055-2" target="_blank">https://www.cell.com/the-innovation/fulltext/S2666-6758(21)00055-2</a>, published yesterday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because this combination of traits isn't known in any other hominid, and because it doesn't seem to showcase signs of any known disease or deformity, it's unlikely (although never impossible) that this is just, like, some guy who looked real weird. </p>
<p>Still, the leap that this is a brand new species just from one skull is problematic. First of all, there are known species of hominid that have unknown skull structures. The article you linked to mentions Devisovans as an example of this. They are a close relative species of ours, and some people of east Asian descent have their DNA in their genomes! We only know they exist because we sequenced the DNA of some non-skull bones, so we have no idea what their heads would have looked like. That means it's possible that this is just a skull of a species we already knew about. Even if this is the case, that's still a really cool find! </p>
<p>I should also mention that even if this is a species we already knew about, it's almost certainly not <em>H. sapiens</em>, as the time and place it was found doesn't match up with human migration. Present evidence suggests that modern humans probably didn't make it to East Asia until about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_human_migrations" target="_blank">50,000 years ago</a>, and this individual lived in present day China over 146,000 years ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That article repeats the <em>claims</em> of the team that found the skull &quot;<em>It could be a new species of human</em>&quot;, but also puts it into the context of other old human remains discovered in the region.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dragon Man joins a number of early human remains uncovered in China that have proven difficult to categorise. These include remains from Dali, Jinniushan, Hualongdong and the Xiahe jawbone from the Tibetan Plateau.  </p>
<p>There has been a fierce debate about whether these remains represent primitive examples of Homo sapiens, Neanderthals, a human group called the Denisovans, or something else entirely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it's one piece of pretty interesting evidence, the hard part is determining where it fits in the human evolution story and it's offshoots, predecessors and extinct or assimilated competitors etcetera. Because yeah, it's just one skull.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I argue that this question arises from a misconception about how species are defined. they are defined by obvious differences when comparing an individual versus other known individuals that we suspect are related but separated in the family tree by huge amounts of time causing obvious differences. it is arbitrary but it works because there are a countable number of them.</p>
<p>if instead we were able to obtain every single fossil of every single ancestor for analysis, there would be none in the genealogical line where we could identify and say &quot;this is a different species&quot; because the difference from one generation to the next would be imperceptible. the word <em>species</em> would lose meaning entirely because we have the entire chain. the word species has meaning only because we do not have the whole picture but only  the snapshots and those snapshots are sufficiently unique to be called separate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assigning species level status from skeletal remains not something that is all that easy to do, but without alternative means it’s all that paleoanthropologists have to assemble our family tree.  Ideally researchers will use statistical metrics on a number of morphological features to determine if a specimen fits within the range of variation for a generally accepted species or lies outside of it (which may indicate that you have a new species). Skeletal and dental remains are actually a pretty conservative measure of speciation - basically if you go by skeletal remains alone you are likely to underestimate the number of species within a given sample.  That said, with fragmentary evidence the picture can be really murky and often remains that way until new finds are made.  For example, during the 1960s there was a lot of research grouping very fragmentary ape fossils into the genus Dryopithecus. However, with additional work a number of these were reassigned into a variety of other genera (Sivapithecus, etc.).  </p>
<p>Another thing to note is that there are also a number of philosophical debates on where to draw the line on what constitutes a new species.  Remember that species evolve through time and the morphology and variation present within a given lineage changes through time.  This can make assigning species level status to a set of fossils difficult - basically, is there enough difference to suggest a new species is present or does it just represent something a bit different than previously seen?  Overall researchers tend to be “splitters” or “lumpers” when it comes to this issue.  Splitters are likely to put a divergent find into a new taxon while lumpers are more likely to assign it to an existing taxon.  For example, among paleoanthropologists, some believe that African Homo erectus is divergent enough to be placed into its own species of Homo ergaster, leaving only Asian finds in the species Homo erectus.</p>
<p>With respect to the current Dragon man find, I haven’t read the paper yet - but it has a general Homo heidelbergensis / archaic H. sapiens  vibe to me...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
