<p>Out of respect for my new home and the host family, id like to learn a basic bit of the history, especially because i heard about 'the troubles' during the 90's. But when i tried to educate myself with Wikipedia, the tsunami of information soon got too confusing for me. Can someone please explain?</p>
<p>What happened during this time? What trauma does my host family carry?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit: I had quite a few messages through but the thread is locked so I'll get around to replying to everyone as I can but I'm not an expert, or even much of an eye-witness to this. I'd recommend a book called &quot;Making Sense of the Troubles&quot; by David McKittrick and David McVea for a broad over-view. </p>
<p>(I'm 35 and grew up in a unionist family in Ireland before leaving the country for university).  </p>
<p>The other responses are great but I'd like to emphasise the civil rights roots of the troubles. The level of discrimination against Catholics was astonishing. Unionist Protestants owned most of the land, businesses, housing - occupied positions of power and control. Trying to rent a house, or get hired at a business was much harder as a catholic. </p>
<p>The Titanic was built in northern Ireland - by protestants, because the shipbuilder hired less than 5% roman Catholics. Catholics went to schools run by the church because state schools wouldn't admit them. Social housing went preferentially to protestants etc etc. </p>
<p>A protestant landlord might have multiple votes in municipal elections whereas a catholic who rented had none.  Police, politics - all skewed in one direction. </p>
<p>The civil rights movement sought universal suffrage but as their early protests and marches were met with obstruction and eventually violence from unionist defence groups and the local police (RUC) it became more radical and militant. The hard-line stance from the British state and horrible mishandling of the situation led to a breakdown in relations between the British Army (initially sent in to protect protestors from local violence) and the civil rights movement and spiralled into a small civil war. </p>
<p>I can remember soldiers on the streets and multiple army checkpoints between home and school but by the time I was 10 the agreement had been signed and bombings became more and more sporadic. </p>
<p>Personally I don't believe brexit will lead to another such situation, recent violence is opportunistic on the part of politicians and criminal groups. Equally I don't expect to see a united Ireland in my lifetime - the level of intransigence on this issue from one half of the population cannot be overstated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a significant cultural and religious divide on the island of Ireland. Most of that island is made up of the Republic of Ireland, an independent country. The rest is Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom with (roughly) the same standing as England, Wales, or Scotland. </p>
<p>In the past, <em>all</em> of Ireland was under the control of the UK, and many historical wars and rebellions were fought over the issue. Eventually, most of Ireland broke away and formed a new country, but Northern Ireland stayed with the UK. The people in the Republic of Ireland considered themselves oppressed by an outside force, but many of the people in Northern Ireland were settlers directly from the UK and wanted to remain a part of it. On top of this, most people in the Republic of Ireland are/were Catholic, while Northern Ireland is primarily Protestant, and these two branches of Christianity don't always get along. </p>
<p>The Troubles were essentially a fight over whether Northern Ireland should leave the UK and join the Republic of Ireland. (Or, from the perspective of the Republic, whether Northern Ireland's inclusion in the UK was ever legitimate) This was an extremely complicated issue, because not even the people in Northern Ireland could agree. One of the main forces was the Irish Republican Army, a secretive paramilitary organization that engaged in domestic terrorism under the reasoning that this was the only way to get the UK to recognize Northern Ireland's right to leave the UK and/or scare out of Ireland all the Northern Irish who wanted to remain part of the UK (who the IRA saw as colonizers). The UK, in turn, took a hard line and engaged in lots of questionable tactics to neutralize the IRA - including torture of its members. </p>
<p>Ultimately, The Troubles were resolved with the Good Friday Agreement, which did recognize the right of Northern Ireland to leave the UK but also the fact that the Northern Irish generally did not want to do that at this time and shouldn't be bombed until they did. However, in the wake of Brexit (which was significantly complicated by the situation in Ireland - leaving the EU would generally require hardening the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, which the Good Friday Agreement forbids), it's seeming more likely that the Northern Irish may exercise their option to leave the UK and join the Republic/EU.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Northern Ireland has/had two cultural groups - one largely Catholic, Nationalist wanting Northern Ireland to be united with the Republic of Ireland, and one largely Protestant, Unionist wanting Northern Ireland to remain within the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>In the 60s/70s the Catholics were a small minority, fearful of the Protestant majority. And the Protestant majority were fearful of a Catholic majority in an United Ireland. </p>
<p>Discrimination against Catholics, lead to civil rights protests. Which lead to counter-protests and rioting. Which lead to paramilitary groups being created to protect their own side (and attack the other). Which lead to increasing police and military presence to keep the peace - largely to protect the Catholic minority, but on multiple occasions ended up openly attacking them. Which kept escalating to the point where innocent civilians - taxi drivers, people having a quiet drink in a pub - were murdered just because of their religion (although religion in this case implies culture/side/allegiance etc.)</p>
<p>In Northern Ireland, it's still a tense subject, for Nationalists who still want a United Ireland, and Unionists who don't and are fearful of it. In the Republic, it's less pressing of an issue. Many do want a United Ireland, but those in the Republic suffered far less during the Troubles, and the Republic is largely a wealthier nation now. (Poverty and deprivation are often the fuel in any conflict). </p>
<p>In short - in the Republic, especially away from the border areas, it's likely to be largely a non-issue for you. In Northern Ireland, it might be more of an issue; though I'd expect largely confined to certain areas and certain times of year (eg. &quot;marching season&quot; - April to August) when the cultural identities and divides come to the fore again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When Ireland gained independence in 1921 the North was &quot;partitioned&quot; (i.e. cut off from the rest of the country and kept in the UK).</p>
<p>The North was partitioned because they had a lot of citizens loyal to the UK (mostly protestants) who wanted the remain with the UK and not be a minority in the new Catholic Ireland.</p>
<p>The Northern province of Ireland is 9 counties and was approximately 50:50 Catholic and protestant in 1921. But the 4 North Eastern counties had a large Protestant majority. So the exercise carried out by the loyalists was to determine what was the largest amount of Ireland they could hive off and guarantee a permanent loyalist (read-protestant) majority. Those are the 6 counties.</p>
<p>That left northern Ireland with a sizeable Catholic minority that was systemically oppressed for the next 50 years, in housing, education and employment.</p>
<p>In the 60s a social movement for Catholic civil rights grew and was brutally suppressed by the sectarian northern Irish government.</p>
<p>This carry on reinvigorated the Irish republican army - an organisation that had gone through several incarnations since the Irish war of independence - who were skewing marxist. </p>
<p>In response to this the loyalists formed a paramilitary organisation with the tacit support of the police and army.</p>
<p>That led to an ongoing conflict (essentially tit for tat atrocities) between the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries and the crown forces. This conflict split down religious lines, with catholics sympathetic to the IRA and Irish unification and protestants supporting the loyalists and continuing union with the UK.</p>
<p>Mainstream conflict continued until the Good Friday agreement in 1998 which provided a pathway to peace. The GFA was a) a political compromise between the major political parties, both republican and loyalist, in Northern Ireland and b) a bilateral agreement between the UK and the Republic of Ireland which regularised the international status of Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Norther Ireland now exists in a sort of limbo, neither fully in the UK nor fully in Ireland and the citizens have the choice to identify as either British or Irish. Both the UK and Ireland have a statutory role in the protection of the rights of Northern Ireland.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
