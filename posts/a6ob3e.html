<p>They don't actually sit outside of it, the real periodic table looks like <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/32-column_periodic_table-a.png/650px-32-column_periodic_table-a.png" target="_blank">this</a>, but it's generally too wide to be useful so those two groups of elements are grouped below the periodic table.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's just how the periodic table is set out usually. There are various other ways of setting it out <a href="https://thumbnails-visually.netdna-ssl.com/ThePeriodicCircle_503d6c999bf9f.jpg" target="_blank">including some</a> that <a href="https://www.johnpratt.com/atomic/images/round/circular_periodic_table.jpg" target="_blank">are circular</a>.</p>
<p>The layout comes from solutions to an equation in Quantum Mechanics; as you go down the table (so allow for more electron energy levels) the possible number of electrons goes up quite a bit. It is 2 at the lowest energy level, then 8 for the next, then 18, then 32, then 50 (although I don't think anyone has managed to get something with that many electrons).</p>
<p>There's a diagram demonstrating this (kind of) <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Electron_subshels_(triangles\).png" target="_blank">here</a>; as you allow for more electron layers, you can start adding in a lot more electrons.</p>
<p>Although as with most things it is a bit more complicated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the periodic table is a bit like a pyramid. There are more elements every other row.</p>
<ul>
<li>The 1st row has only 2.</li>
<li>The 2nd and 3rd row have 8 each.</li>
<li>The 4th and 5th row have 18 each.</li>
<li>The 6th and 7th row have 32 each.</li>
</ul>
<p>If it weren't for things braking down and being to radioactive and shotlive to allow for chemistry, this trend would be expected to continue for further elements.</p>
<p>The explanation is a bit iffy, but the ELI5 version is that chemistry is determined by the way electrons are distributed around an atom. Similar distribution of electrons mean similar chemical behavior.</p>
<p>The columns in the periodic table represent electrons in a similar configuration. </p>
<p>The name of the element is determined by the number of protons it has in its core. Since protons are positively charged and electrons are negatively charged, an atom that is neither missing or has too many electrons has exactly as many electrons as it has protons.</p>
<p>The protons are all in the core and don't matter much for chemistry but the electrons surrounding the core are the important bit.</p>
<p>Electrons are arranged in rather complicated ways, but one metaphor is that they orbit the core in shells. The innermost and smaller shells get filled up first and what is left in the outermost shells does the chemistry bit.</p>
<p>The most inner shell has only room for two electrons. Which is why the first row only has room for hydrogen and helium.</p>
<p>An element with 3 or more protons and therefore three or more electrons needs to star putting them in shells further out.</p>
<p>As you can imagine from the metaphor a large shell further out has more room than a smaller inner shell, so it takes more electrons to fill it up.</p>
<p>This is why the rows in the table keep getting bigger.</p>
<p>All elements that a have a full outer shell. have no reason to borrow electrons from anywhere and thus don't really bond with anything much and are chemical unreactive. This is why all the elements on the rightmost column act more or less the same and are grouped together as noble gases.</p>
<p>All elements that are missing just one electron to be full, fall into the group right next to it. Theses halogens react in similar manner with other elements, producing salts with metal and so on.</p>
<p>Of course since each additional shell has more room the higher you go the more variation there can be.</p>
<p>This is only a very ELI5 version the real stuff is far more complicated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The modern periodic table is actually quite an amazing predictor for chemical properties of matter, but we didn't know about all of the elements as it was being conceived, and nature doesn't have a symmetric, visually-pleasing balance of elements. The rows to which you are referring actually slide up and squeeze into the main table, but drawing it that way isn't helpful. </p>
<p>It's very similar to a globe or a cartesian map, especially if you think of the United States: we often display maps of the US with both Alaska and Hawaii in the lower left corner, cut out and pasted into the Pacific Ocean so we can just fit all of the states in a nice little rectangle. If you really look into all of the families and periods, pay attention to electron cloud properties, properties of metals, etc, the table really is laid out brilliantly. </p>
<p>It does take a bit of effort to understand how to interpret it all, but if you are interested in learning chemistry, or even just taking a high-school or college-level class, it is worth studying. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
