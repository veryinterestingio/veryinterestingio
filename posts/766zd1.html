		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OH MY GOSH, some of my useless chem knowledge can come into play.</p>
<p>What other people have said is close, but not entirely correct.</p>
<p>You're not using friction per se to just &quot;rub off&quot; the graphite. What is happening is actually a solubility between two nonpolar solid substances, the rubber and the graphite. So the London dispersion forces (really weak intermolecular forces) between these molecules are attracted to each other and as you rub and create heat it increases the attraction and removes more graphite from the paper as it is attracted to the rubber. That's why you get dirty rubber dust.</p>
<p>That's also why your lead sticks to paper to begin with, those same London dispersion forces are attracting the lead to the paper. Those forces are actually a little stronger than attraction between the graphite and the rubber which is why you have to put a little energy into getting it all out. ☺</p>
<p>Edit: I was so excited I forgot to answer your question completely. Erasers are made out of rubber because it is a nonpolar solid material which attracts other nonpolar solids, like graphite. The way it is malleable and crumbles (like others mentjoned) makes it less abrasive to the paper itself. </p>
<p>Edit 2: Rubber being nonpolar is also why it is an insulator and does not conduct electricity. Wooooo! SCIENCE!</p>
<p>Edit 3: Thanks for the gold!! Can someone ELI5 to me what I do with it?! (Can't wait for all the unecessarily advanced explanations ??)</p>
<p>Edit 4: Whoa, my dudes. Did not expect my highest comment to be about sciencey wiencey erasers! This gal needs to go finish her homework and break away from the Reddit vortex, though. I need to make corrections on the rubber/conductivity (Edit 2- defo some misleading info) and will do it at some point later tonight! Thanks to all who shared their questions and knowledge! </p>
<p>Hope you guys are all off sciencing now! ☺</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because graphite is very brittile and the rubber snaps the little pieces off the paper without tearing the paper. It doesn't work for pen because ink actually soaks into the page.  </p>
<p><a href="https://worldundermicroscope.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img00220.jpg" target="_blank">Here is graphite on paper under a microscope</a> </p>
<p>The graphite sticks to the rubber because it is sharp and rubber is soft. Little spikes of graphite get stuck in the rubber, weakening the rubbers structure, causing the forces that bind the rubber to itself to be less than the force of friction. This is why hard erasers suck ass. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although erasers were originally made from rubber, it is more common today for them to be made from vinyl or plastic. Here is a video elaborating on the history of the change: (Start at 9:27) <a href="https://youtu.be/pgPxgJMW5A8" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/pgPxgJMW5A8</a></p>
<p>As everyone else has said, erasers work through friction. The rubbing transfers the graphite from the paper onto the eraser, leaving the paper relatively undamaged. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
