So your body is ready to fight *something*, and your brain isn't in a position to figure out what to fight, so you either do nothing, start attacking the closest thing, or start running until you can no longer continue to do so or the adrenaline runs out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Personal experience: I suffer from panic attacks. They suck a lot, so I hope OP isn't suffering too.</p>
<p>A panic attack is a combination of cognition and chemistry.  The start of a panic attack is usually a thought or notion that develops into a distortion, which causes intense short term fear and anxiety.  A distortion is another word for the misperception of the true reality of a situation.  For example, during a panic attack you may believe that you are in mortal danger -- even actively dying -- even if no true danger is present.</p>
<p>Chemically, adrenaline and similar neurotransmitters are responsible for much of the physical effects.  Adrenaline is a funny chemical because when you need it, you <strong>need it</strong> (outrun the bear, fight to survive, e.g.), so your adrenal gland goes from &quot;trickle&quot; to &quot;dump it all and hope I survive&quot;.  This can make it difficult or impossible to pump the brakes once your body begins the adrenaline dump.  Once your body is flooded with those chemicals, the only way through is to ride out the wave.</p>
<p>Medication can help prevent the body from reaching the fight/flight response in the first place, and cognitive therapy can help reduce the impact of fearful thoughts and prevent them from developing into distortions.  Therapy also helps patients deal with the runaway train thought process, decoupling the physical (my body is ready to GO!) and the mental (I'm not dying, this moment will soon pass).</p>
<p>It's a very difficult and unpleasant experience, but most people will only experience a true panic attack a handful of times.  Those who suffer more frequent attacks may do so because of family history, past trauma, current stressors, and other external &amp; internal factors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve posted this before but figured it was relevant in this thread:</p>
<p>I actually participated in a medical study during college that aimed to replicate the hormone released during a panic attack. I had to spend two afternoons in the hospital having my vitals monitored. One day I was given an injection of a placebo, and the other day I was injected with the synthetic hormone that invoked the symptoms of a panic attack. It was immediately clear it wasn’t the placebo. Sweaty palms, increased heart rate, lump in throat and knotted sensation in the stomach. It was exactly like the feeling you’d get when nearly avoiding a disaster. I can’t recall the name of the drug they were testing, but the end goal was to reverse engineer the chemical reaction to find a way to help people with severe anxiety and panic attacks. That was quite the experience (and it paid well for a college kid, too)!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's a cycle that feeds into itself causing big trouble.</p>
<p>It starts with a minor inconvenience, something that's bothersome and maybe a little worrisome.</p>
<p>An emotionally stable person will find a solution, or get over the problem because it's not so big.</p>
<p>An overly anxious person might instead start the process of feedback, anxiety that comes from anxiety: Oh no, now I have this problem. It could get bigger, that would be bad. I would not be able to get out of it. But maybe it's not. But what if it is. Oh no of it goes bad how am I going to do that other thing. That would be really bad...</p>
<p>And the more deep into the well you go with these thoughts, the more anxious you becomes. And anxiety brings more catastrophic thoughts.</p>
<p>Until you are so worried about the possible outcomes that you've began hyperventilating, low oxigen gets to the brain, and that brings confusion, and the problem is actually getting bigger and out of control. The worries are starting to become real. </p>
<p>Worry becomes fear. Fear for life because you can't breathe and don't have control. You feel like you're dying. </p>
<p>And in a situation in which death is a possibility the brain pumps out messages of more alertness, more fear. </p>
<p>You can see how it can spiral into something really bad and heavy to bear. </p>
<p>And it can become crippling too, because now the simple thought of the possibility of having a panic attack will spiral into one. </p>
<p>And that becomes agoraphobia and needs help in treating. But it's treatable, no worries. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll give this a shot as an actual ELI5... So when you're really, really scared, you might feel a tingling in your body which is called adrenaline, or you might start breathing really hard. These things happen to help you run away and give you energy, and since you see something scary it makes sense, and you just know you have to leave, or stand still, or hide.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you are in a normal situation, and maybe you just think something that you really don't like, or remember something, and your heart starts beating very fast and you get that tingling feeling, you might get super sweaty all of a sudden, but the problem is, there's nothing scaring you. You don't know why that's happening, and you get confused, and once you get confused, your body reacts even harder, and that makes you more confused, and the body then reacts even harder, like many waterfalls of unpleasant things coming. The more you try not to think about it, the harder it seems to come, and sometimes you might even think you're dying or going to faint.</p>
<p>And more or less your brain tricked you, making your body go into this super-scared mode, when there's no reason to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
