		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The universe appears to be infinite in size, ever since the Big Bang - although what happens during and/or before the Big Bang is still very strongly under debate. The expansion of the universe is not the expansion of the <em>edges</em> of the universe - it's just that everything within the universe is getting further from everything else, and so the <em>density</em> of matter is decreasing.</p>
<p>The <em>observable</em> universe does have a radius of 46 billion light years across. This is defined as the present-day distance to the most distant object that light could theoretically reach us from. The key phrase there is &quot;<em>present-day</em> distance&quot;. As the universe is expanding, an object is further away <em>now</em> than it was when the light was emitted. The distance the light travelled is <em>less</em> than the current distance to the object. For example, the light travels a distance of 13.8 billion light years, but the object it came from is 46 billion light years away. This means we could theoretically see an object that is <em>currently</em> 46 billion light years away, so we say 46 billion light years is the radius of the observable universe.</p>
<p>As a side note, I'm saying &quot;theoretically&quot; a lot there, because the early universe is actually quite opaque. It's so thick and dense that light doesn't actually travel through it. So we don't actually see light from the very beginning of the universe, even though it had enough time to travel here - the earliest and most distant light we see is from the moment the universe got thin enough that it became transparent. This light is actually what forms the cosmic microwave background.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When space expands, nothing is moving <em>through</em> space, and that's the only thing with a speed limit.</p>
<p>Stuff beyond our Hubble sphere is receding faster than light, in the sense that the proper distance between us and it is increasing at more than one light-year per year, but relative to the things around it, nothing there is moving any faster than we are here.</p>
<p>Basically, a lot more space gets added <em>between</em> distant things, which doesn't break the rules implied by relativity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Am I missing something, I see a lot of claims that the universe is infinite, but do we not know for sure if it is? I remember watching this physicist saying that if the space is flat then yes it is infinite, but if it's curved, then it's not (e.g. if 2 parallel lines would meet at some point), and we don't know yet what kind of universe we live in... do we not?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have the observable universe in mind, not the whole universe. The rate of expansion of the universe at far enough distances appears to exceed the speed of light. This is where the term &quot;observable universe&quot; comes from, because beyond the distance where the rate of expansion equals the speed of light, no light from there will ever reach us. Conversely, as light moves from things closer to that boundary, the distance between the light and the source that admitted it grows, so the total distance traveled by the light is greater than you would predict just based on the speed of light and the duration of travel. Hence why the observable universe is larger than just the age of the universe times the speed of light.</p>
<p>How can something be expanding at, or exceeding, the speed of light when the speed of light is the fastest anything can go? Well, the expansion of the universe doesn't actually &quot;move&quot; anything, just increases the distances between things, and the apparent faster-than-light acceleration we see is the result of our perspective. Think about drawing points on a balloon. If you designate one point as the reference point, measure the distance between that point and two points some distance away, one closer and one further. After blowing up the balloon some and measure those distances, the point further away from the reference will appear to have increased at a greater rate  than the closer one, though from the perspective of every point, they are completely stationary and it is everything else that is moving away. So things can appear to accelerate beyond the speed of light without actually breaking the limit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
