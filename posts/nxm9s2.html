		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ever watch a video of someone putting elastic bands round  a watermelon? They keep adding bands and nothing happens, until they add one more, and you have an explosion of watermelon pulp, and a lot of cleaning up to do ...   </p>
<p>When your genitals are stimulated, some neurons in the brain and spinal cord linked to those nerves shift to an excited state. If the nerves continue to be stimulated, the neurons move into a more excited state, and also start exciting their neighbors. Eventually, the region of excited neurons reaches some different neurons that link to nerves that trigger an orgasm - a set of cascading reflexes through the muscles in the groin that trigger physical aspects of orgasm. At about the same time, all the excited neurons dump a load of neurotransmitters as they drop back into a low-excitation state - this is why orgasm makes you feel good. The neurotransmitters include oxytocin,  which helps social bonding and feeling close to people.  </p>
<p>The process then starts again - for young people, excitation may begin again in a few minutes, and they can have another orgasm soon after. For older people, the refractory period before excitation can build up may be much longer - days or weeks.  </p>
<p>The excitation phase can obviously also be influenced by other factors - visual, aural, olfactory and non-genital tactile stimulus can feed the excitation phase. Anxiety, stress and depression can dampen or suppress it.  </p>
<p>And there are more direct nerve links and reflexes in the spinal cord - these can shortcut or bypass some aspects of the excitation/release cycle. In particular, vibratory stimulus can be used to trigger orgasm and ejaculation in men who have suffered spinal injury, and who have no direct genital sensitivity. As an older man who has had issues with long refractory periods and anorgasmia, the discovery that a strong vibrator can be as effective for a man as for a woman has been a wonderful revelation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your orgasm is triggered through your brain whenever you <strong>trained it to fire</strong>.  This routine specifically takes place in the neocortex and it's the sum of all your prior life experiences.</p>
<p>For mature males, an ejection of seed can be forced through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroejaculation" target="_blank">electroejaculation</a>, so it's not a simple matter of stimulation, or chemicals, or locomotion.  Women who fake orgasms tend to train their attentive partners to almost orgasm on command, forcing a synchronization of sorts through a projection and manifestation of pleasure.  This is to say, an orgasm is something far more complicated than biology shows.</p>
<p>To understand orgasms, you have to know a bit about how the brain generally works in the abstract. The brain learns, using multiple senses and time.  But time - especially time - is key.  Your own modern orgasm is a product of your own experiential evolution, of encouragement, of repetition.  Of complexity.  Of leisure time.  And the brain keeps all understanding of the universe as 3-D models indexed to time.</p>
<p>Over the years in a person's development, the brain gradually develops a model of what pleasure and an orgasm should look like.  It starts from zero and repetition. A good sensation was repeated until something better came along or you got bored of it.  Clusters of nerves send feedback to the brain and the brain takes note.  Clockwise. Counterclockwise.  Years go by.  When you crave comfort, it leads the body to initiate and actuate the sensation.</p>
<p>As time goes on, the brain gradually integrates all senses into the experience: touch, smell, taste, sight, pressures, temperatures, and indescribable compound experiences individual to a person.  As in, your prior life experiences no one else can copy.</p>
<p>Your own model of an orgasm is both reinforced and evolves through time and repetition, and it gets a major recalibration when physical maturity is achieved and reproduction is biologically functional.  New components enter the fray, and the brain continues integrating what you'd call sexual experiences with senses.  Things change.  Brain takes note.</p>
<p>However, the truth of it is that all sensed moments integrate into the experience, not just immediate sexual ones, which is why you have outliers that add to it like foot fetish stuff, eyebrow stimulation, visual reminders you find pleasing or are attracted to.  Outfits.  Perfumes.  Important life events.  Impulses of pain.  Things that have led you to prior orgasms, or near misses.  Associations.  Discordant things.  Universe of things.</p>
<p>This is why new experiences tend to imprint on a person very strongly, especially when contrasted to a volume of prior experience. It's immediately registered.  The brain tries to fit any new thing that is sensed into a known model.  When that doesn't happen, that's literally how you get startled.  New thing could be good, or bad, and it helps move your sexuality along.</p>
<p>Our best and latest neuroscience describes a situation where for basic things, a particular neuron is half-fired - or primed - before the brain agrees to a firing solution of sorts.</p>
<p>When the eye sees something new, a parallel computation of sorts takes place in neocortex columns.  That new object that showed up?  If you've seen it before, the brain starts narrowing down possibilities of what it is and at what angle or state of existence it's in.  The neurons that are sure about it start getting primed at half voltage.  Eventually bad guesses power down and the winning vote (neuron) fires.  Signal moves through the electro-meatware and mazel tov, that was an upside-down soda can all along.  This all happens in under a milisecond.</p>
<p>That's pretty much how your orgasm is triggered: a long chain of sensations and expectations and repetitions are integrated and walked through and eventually your orgasm trigger is what you made it to be -- as you lived and grew and developed.  </p>
<p>During sex, your brain is partially primed for that one thing that sets you off in the moment: an overwhelming amount of something, a sudden new thing, a sudden new thought, a sudden new projection.  The right amount of something.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
