		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unreal Engine has more than 2 million lines of code alone, and custom code on top of that will be at least 100,000-500,000 by the time it ships. Some could easily double that figure, especially if you include associated tools for the games.</p>
<p>A modern game is probably 1.5-5 million lines of code, if written in a C-like language. Contrast with a game from the mid-90's at around 3-500,000 of mixed assembly language and higher-level code. Quake shipped with about 310,000 lines of code.</p>

<p>addition source: years of writing game code</p>
<p>EDIT: One additional note - the first games I shipped included the Operating System in it's code line count, modern games run on top of an existing operating system with substantially more lines of code than the game that runs on it. This is independent of third-party libraries used in either one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Please keep in mind when people are quoting these numbers they are including the lines of dependent libraries like Unreal Engine, Network Libs, IO, etc. Most game devs will never even delv into those libs unless things have gone sideways. I am guessing hand written code for a game including all the libs is approximately 20% of the total lines?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our FPS game Diabotical, which is coming out soon, is 350,000 lines of code after doing my best to exclude dependencies from the count, but that may still include small dependencies like liberally licensed headers that I copy-pasted into the code base.
That's  300,000 of C++, 30,000 of HLSL. JS adds about 20,000 used for UI and server stuff. (I reckon only about 250,000 are actually written by me).</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<p>Edit: Corrected some numbers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>New PC games is a very broad category and the answer will vary wildly, depending on the type, size, budget and scale of the game and depend on whether you include dependencies, such as graphics, sound and physics engines.</p>
<p>While a simple tic-tac-toe mobile game (Created using a third party game engine) could be created with a few hundreds lines of code, a first person shooter (Created using only in house components) would range in the millions of lines of code.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I developed a medium-fidelity driving simulator in Java for doing automated vehicle studies. The simulator is based on one written at the Pervasive Computing lab at Universit√§t Duisburg-Essen which the students and faculty graciously made available for at no cost some years back.  It is built on an open-source gaming engine and an open-source physics implementation. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Driving Simulator: 29,407 lines</p>
<p>Physics: 15,929 lines</p>
<p>Engine: I don't know, it crashed the plugin which counts lines in my code. It's a whole lot more than the driving simulator code. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
