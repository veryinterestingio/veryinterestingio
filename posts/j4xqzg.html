		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water is hardly compressible, so no matter how much you have, and the distance it has to travel, the pressure is nearly uniform throughout the entire system. So all you have to do is create enough pressure somewhere in the system and it will remain pretty much constant from the nearest tap to the farthest tap. One way this is done is through water towers. Water towers are generally not a water storage instrument (not their main function anyway) - they exist to provide pressure from the downward force of gravity on the water perched high above ground.  To pressurize the system, all one needs to do is pump water up into those towers, and then they'll help maintain constant pressure throughout the system. In certain water systems, there will also be pumping stations, or individual water towers on top of buildings to supplement pressure. Those mini towers work the same way as the larger towers, but their impacts are localized to the building they're sitting on top of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By something known as head pressure.<br />
Picture putting a bucket of water on top of your house with a hose connected to it leading to ground level.
If the hose is capped off and a pressure gauge is attached at the ground, due to the forces of gravity on the water, you will have pressure just due to the weight of water sitting on water.
Beings how water is non compressible, the hose will have all the force of the water up in the bucket.
For every foot above your gauge, you can plan on .43 PSI of pressure on the gauge.  So assuming your bucket is 15 foot in the air, your gauge would read somewhere around 6.45PSI.  In an ideal city, the water treatment plant (the place that prepares the water) would be located uphill of the town so that just gravity can do all the work.  But in some cases, that’s not an option. So in typical mankind fashion, we worked around it by building water towers and holding tanks that are elevated.<br />
If said tank is built say, 200 foot in the air, you will then have about 86 PSI at ground level. While that is a bit too much for most houses, it does give you a bit of wiggle room.   Large electric pumps are used to fill and keep full the water tank when needed but then afterwards, the gravity is used to push the water out for distributing to end users.   This system is far more efficient than having a dedicated pump constantly running to keep pressure up. </p>
<p>Source:I’m a dude that makes all of this happen and am responsible for keeping it running.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to the other comments which mostly discuss how the water pressure is generated an maintained, I want to point out that there is some pressure loss over that distance when the water is flowing or when the water has to go uphill. My understanding is that the piping is designed to give a reasonable flow of water despite this pressure drop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
