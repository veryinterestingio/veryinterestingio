		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Credit cards give you better protective options against fraud. You have a lot more time to report fraudulent use of the card, you're usually limited to a <em>really</em> low amount of liability (like $50), if that because many companies will waive you of responsibility if someone used your card. Debit cards have weaker forms of these protections, you oftentimes have to report the fraudulent use within a limited amount of time and the longer you go without realizing it was used without your authorization the more you could be on the hook for paying stuff.</p>
<p>The other advantage is just that credit cards offer you a lot of rewards for using them - cashback, discounts or special payment options at some businesses, points to use for purchases, travel points, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With a credit card no money leaves your bank account until it's time to repay the credit. That can be on a monthly basis so people can organise their monthly bills that way. With a debit card you can't buy anything unless you have that amount on your account at the time of purchase. </p>
<p>For many people though this is the disadvantage of a credit card; it tricks you into spending more than you can afford</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Using a credit card, you’re using the credit card issuer’ s money, not yours, until you pay it off. So if it’s lost/stolen and someone uses it fraudulently, it’s the issuer’s money at stake, not yours, while the problem is sorted out. With a debit card, you’re spending your own money, from your own bank/credit union account, so if there’s fraud it’s your money at stake while the problem is sorted out. In either case, there are legal and contractual protections that help prevent you from losing money (depending on the actual facts and circumstances), including provisions about temporarily recrediting your bank account while debit card fraud is investigated, so it’s not as though using a debit card you are completely out of luck or something. But still to me the biggest differerence is whose money the card taps into and its practical impact on your role in a fraud situation (credit card fraud: you‘re trying not to have to pay your own money for a charge you didn’t make; debit card fraud: you’re trying to get your own money back). (This is not legal advice; be sure to read and understand the terms and conditions of any card you have or are considering. ☺️)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ol>
<li>
<p>Security - Charges to credit are not charged to you until the end of the billing cycle. It is generally much easier to have fraudulent or mistaken charges removed from a credit card.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building credit - Use of credit cards helps build credit history.</p>
</li>
<li>Buying on credit - Credit cards do not require that you pay the full amount immediately. You can carry a balance on a credit card and make only interest payments if you don't have the money on hand for the full amount.</li>
