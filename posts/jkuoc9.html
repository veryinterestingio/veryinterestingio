		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a research scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and SETI Institute. My research focus is on detection, vetting and characterization of transiting exoplanets from Kepler, K2, and TESS, with the goal of understanding how these exoplanets form, evolve, and compare to the Solar System.</p>
<p>Now citizen scientists can be part of the hunt for exoplanets, too, by joining Planet Patrol.</p>
<p>The goal of Planet Patrol is twofold:</p>
<ol>
<li>Help scientists vet thousands of TESS planet candidates by visually inspecting stars seen by TESS.</li>
<li>Use the results to help train automated vetting algorithms and improve their efficiency.</li>
</ol>
<p>Automated methods of processing TESS data sometimes fail to catch imposters that look like exoplanets. The human eye is extremely good at spotting such imposters, and we need citizen scientists to help us distinguish between the look-alikes and genuine planets.</p>
<p>Some of the most exciting planet candidates are difficult to analyze. For example, Earth is a small planet with a long orbit, which means it would generate a weak signal in the data and be difficult to detect, vet and ultimately confirm. Planet Patrol volunteers will help me and my team sift through TESS images of potential exoplanets by answering a set of questions for each - like whether an image contains multiple bright sources or resembles stray light, rather than light from a star, or is simply too noisy for detailed analysis. These questions help us narrow down the list of possible planets for further follow-up study.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, thanks for doing this! Given how much information can be also understood from the lightcurves, was there an active reason to <em>not</em> show them in combination with the images themselves? Would that bias people too much towards saying something else was going on (or not going on) if they could also see dips in a lightcurve? Thanks again!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Also, I'm curious to know which was the most unexpected exoplanet you pulled out from your data: have you ever found something you really didn't expect to?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kepler was clearly an extremely successful exoplanet hunter. I get the impression that TESS has been less so, and that the initial expectations of numbers of detected exoplanets has been lower than expected, especially given the differential between the two fields of view. However, I'm not sure that my info on the TESS findings, both candidate and confirmed, are up-to-date. Do you know what the current candidate and confirmed numbers are for TESS, and the extent to which these are likely to increase? Also, am I right in thinking that TESS has a reaction wheel problem? Thanks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
