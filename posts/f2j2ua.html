		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't actually.</p>
<p>Water melts at 273K, iron at right around 1800K</p>
<p>For one gram of water  go from absolute 0 to fully melted at 273K requires around 600J to heat the ice to its melting point, and then close to another 350 to melt completely for around 950J</p>
<p>For one gram of iron to go from absolute 0 to its melting point of 1800K, it requires around 810, then another 250 to melt to liquid. 1060J to melt the iron.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about why it <strong>seems</strong> to take so much more energy. The most obvious is the fact that 1800+K temperatures are not as common as 273+K temperatures in the universe. And especially here on earth.</p>
<p>Another reason is due to a nice little thing called black body radiation. By the time iron gets to its melting point, it's throwing off so much energy as electromagnetic radiation (light) that it gets harder and harder to pour enough energy into it to overcome this loss. And of course finally there's conductive and convective cooling. Also known as environmental cooling, where it's losing energy to its much lower temperature environment via air, or maybe even worse, water. Overcoming that cooling requires MUCH more energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heat capacity and melting point are loosely related but are different material properties. Let me try to explain.</p>
<p>In solids, thermal properties are basically a measure of 'vibrations' (phonons) within the material, which is determined by the type of atoms, bond strength and the crystal structure. Together, they determine the 'density of states' which basically describes the number of energy states available that can be filled up at a given temperature. Grater density of states (at a given temperature) allows more energy to be 'absorbed' by the material, hence the heat capacity will be higher. While the bond strength is an important parameter, it is not the only parameter.</p>
<p>On the other hand, liquification (or melting) involves overcoming the lattice enthalpy that is holding the material together in a solid state. </p>
<p>Having a lower heat capacity means that there are fewer available states at a given temperature, so you need to give lesser heat to raise the temperature. As you give more heat, at some point, you will give enough energy to break apart the bonds holding the solid together, hence it will melt.</p>
<p>The key difference between metals and ice is that you hit this threshold energy (to break the lattice) faster with ice and much later with metals.</p>
<p>In short, even if a material has a higher heat capacity (which basically means more available energy states for a given temperature), the melting point could be low because of weaker lattice enthalpy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
