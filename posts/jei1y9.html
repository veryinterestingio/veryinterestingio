		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because of tannins (and pseudo-tannins), compounds that often have the same effect in red wine and tea. They bind to proteins in your saliva, and make those proteins aggregate in a way that your saliva becomes less lubricating for your mouth. This is called astringency.</p>
<p>You can make coffee less astringent by brewing it less hot/for less time.</p>
<p>Eating cheese or other fatty foods apparently also reduces astringency.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something that hasn’t been pointed out is that if you were literally “dying of thirst” a cup of coffee would hydrate you.</p>
<p>EDIT- as opposed to taking in nothing at all. A lot about digestion is just keeping the pipes working and lubricated. Once it hits your gut/stomach — different story.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Coffee has a net hydrating effect in regular caffeine consumers. It is objectively a hydrating beverage despite what it feels like. But also, 1 cup of coffee isn’t enough for us to notice this improvement. </p>
<p>Just because we transiently don’t feel like we have improved total body water balance, doesn’t  mean we haven’t.</p>
<p>Most people aren’t great at differentiating thirst from hunger or even boredom. However, why it doesn’t provide a ‘quenching’ sensation is likely because of how we usually drink it; hot, with milk, we sip instead of drink quickly which impacts stomach distention and satiety, and we don’t perceive it as a drink to consume when thirsty or dehydrated. </p>
<p>Which is all interesting because milk is very hydrating due to electrolyte and water content.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe the people claiming its not quenching because of caffeine's diuretic effect is wrong because you experience this thirst quenching the second you drink it and basically the diuretic effect doesn't kick in immediately.</p>
<p>The reason I think it is so might be more on the flavour, texture or temperature of coffee. Hear me out, imagine a hot day and you're thirsty. You take a sip of ice cold cold brew coffee (assuming well brewed, delicious, low astringency and no off flavours). I'm sure that would quench your thirst and feel pretty good. What exactly is the reason I can't comment on because I don't know and can only speculate.</p>
<p>Personally I associate thirst quenching drinks with something more watery and refreshing. So if you take coffee with milk and it becomes a creamy delicious drink, I wouldn't find creamy drinks thirst quenching but it is still delicious. Maybe that's it?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
