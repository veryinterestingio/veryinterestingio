<p>The best thing I found was this quote &quot; The <em>bottom’s</em> risk of getting HIV is very high because the lining of the rectum is thin and may allow HIV to enter the body during anal sex. &quot; <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/analsex.html#:~:text=Being%20a%20receptive%20partner%20during,getting%20HIV%20during%20anal%20sex." target="_blank"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/analsex.html#:\~:text=Being%20a%20receptive%20partner%20during,getting%20HIV%20during%20anal%20sex" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/analsex.html#:\~:text=Being%20a%20receptive%20partner%20during,getting%20HIV%20during%20anal%20sex</a>.</a></p>
<p>What is that supposed to mean though? Can someone elaborate on this?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The vagina lubricates the anus doesn't. Without that lubrication the anus tears (edit to add and the cells become traumatized and more susceptible to letting viruses pass through). When anything (in this case a virus) enters directly into your blood stream (usually through a break in the skin or an injection) <del>you're almost guaranteed to get it</del> you're at high risk of exposure, see u/earthwormjim91 's comment and /u/tehflambo 's comment for clarification.</p>
<p>You're also more at risk if you've performed oral sex on someone HIV positive and have done something to cause micro-tears in your mouth like flossing or eating potato chips.</p>
<p>Anyone who realizes after the fact that they have had such exposure should immediately go to an emergency room for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/pep.html" target="_blank">Post Exposure Prophylaxis</a>.</p>
<p>Edit: Since this comment is on top I'd like to reiterate, once an HIV+ person is medicated, risk of infection drops to nil. <a href="https://www.hiv.gov/tasp" target="_blank">Source</a>. Frequent testing in high risk groups leads to fewer infections. Get tested and support your local testing centers!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First things first.  We can't discuss hiv transmission without first discussing the impact of viral load.</p>
<p>The viral load is the amount of HIV virus particles per unit of blood. The risk of transmission (through any sex) is proportional to the viral load. When someone is on effective treatment for HIV their viral load drops to an undetectable level.  Current tests can go down to 20 virus particles per ml of blood, a viral load of 20. Research has shown that anyone with a viral load less than 200 can't transmit the virus through any sexual activity,  even unprotected activities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aidsmap.com/about-hiv/what-does-undetectable-untransmittable-uu-mean" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.aidsmap.com/about-hiv/what-does-undetectable-untransmittable-uu-mean" target="_blank">https://www.aidsmap.com/about-hiv/what-does-undetectable-untransmittable-uu-mean</a></a></p>
<p>As far as anal sex is concerned, you do not need to be bleeding to get it. The cells that line the rectum are more susceptible to infection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rectal tissue is delicate and easily damaged, which can give the virus direct access to the bloodstream. However, such tissue damage is not necessary for infection to occur: the rectal tissue itself is rich in cells which are directly susceptible to infection.</p>

<p>EDIT: Formatting. And as a disclosure, I am HIV+ and previously worked in an HIV clinic. I stand by what I said here about transmission rates but please do check out the sources yourself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with the type of cells that line each surface. </p>
<p>Epithelial cells are thin, flat, and wide cells almost like steel plates, and are designed to protect a surface from physical forces—these are the cells that line skin, your mouth, your eyeballs, and the vagina. </p>
<p>Columnar cells are tall, rectangular, and squishy. Their primary roles are to secrete secretions and absorb fluids. This is what lines your entire gastrointestinal tract from the stomach onwards and therefore is very good at absorbing nutrients. They also absorb HIV viral particles better.</p>
<p>So in short the cells that line the rectum take up HIV particles more readily than the cells that line the vagina.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
