<p>Like if you drive the same round to work everyday, all those days tend to becomes the same, and your brain doesnt really record the experience because it knows it so well.</p>
<p>You most likely still drive perfectly safely,  observing everything around you etc. Its just that your brain doesnt make a record of the memory. Then you cant recall that specific trip but you know the route like the back of your hand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You probably don’t really space out, your brain just doesn’t bother
to remember it, so once the journey is complete you have little or no recollection of paying attention during the drive.</p>
<p>This happens a lot when it’s a familiar route. The first time your brain is on full alert trying to remember the route as much as possible - it’s all new. Once you’ve made the drive enough times there’s little value to you to remember any mundane specifics so none of it makes it into your memory unless something out of the ordinary happens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The autopilot effect you're referring to is specifically just an extreme form of habit. So, basically, here's how brains work - brain cells have two parts, the parts that send signals (axons) and the parts that receive signals (dendrites). Neurons can receive many signals at once but can only send one signal at a time. When 2 brain cells talk to each other a lot the dendrites (receiving parts) physically move around and grow closer to the axons (sending parts) which makes the space between them (the synapse) shorter. When that space gets shorter the signals happen faster (we're talking milliseconds here but even small bits of time matter in brains). Every time &quot;familiar&quot; signals happen the space gets shorter and shorter and shorter until eventually those signals fire so quickly and so easily that it becomes an automatic sort of thing (habit) that is able to happen in a subconscious way. Other sorts of habits work this way as well. Idk if that's useful and feel free to ask questions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
