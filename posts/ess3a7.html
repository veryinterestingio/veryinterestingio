<p>They collect an ice core by drilling down, take a sample of the ice, carefully melt it, and then analyze the water for viral particles. </p>
<p>They also had to be extra careful to not contaminate the ice cores when they were brought up, to make sure that none of our current microbes contaminate it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Microbiologist and virologist here. Yes, we do basically take a sample of something and analyze it. But things become more complicated. There is no technology right now that can &quot;see&quot; viruses per say. Electron microscopes can visualize viruses but generally require you to enrich and know what you're looking for vaguely.</p>
<p>The way we identify viruses in environmental samples is by sequencing their DNA/RNA. To do this we have special techniques that amplify very small amounts of nucleic acid to much larger ones. (The most common method in this field is called multiple displacement amplification.) We also prep all of our reagents and other samples as well so we can determine what is truly in the sample and what is contaminant from the lab.</p>
<p>Finally we use computational tools to determine what genetic material goes with what and try to identify genes that are likely to be found in viruses. This field is very young and we're still in our infancy. A lot of what we do is &quot;best guess&quot; work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
