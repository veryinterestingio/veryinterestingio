		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The phrase &quot;I think therefore I am&quot;, or &quot;Cogito ergo sum&quot; in Latin, was made popular by the philosopher Rene Descartes. </p>
<p>In his work, he goes about destroying the assumptions that most people had in philosophy before him. Many people would say, &quot;ah well I see the sun, or I feel the grass, so therefore it exists&quot;. Descartes basically said, &quot;ok, but what if your brain is in a jar, and you are just dreaming all of this?&quot; </p>
<p>Philosophy is based on axioms. Axioms are self-evident facets of reason that allow you to construct the rest of philosophy on them. Descartes basically argued that all of the axioms that had previously been used were wrong because they were not self-evident. In the same sense that you don't know you are in a dream when you are dreaming, how do you know that anything around you is as it truly is? So he started his philosophy with doubting <strong>everything.</strong> </p>
<p>At first, he couldn't figure out where to go from there. How are you supposed to know anything if you doubt everything? Eventually, he discovers his first axiom: I think therefore I am. In order for him to doubt everything, <strong>he</strong> must exist. He can't assume anything about who or what he really is but he can safely assume that he exists, otherwise, he would not be thinking about the fact that he exists.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The philosopher Descartes wanted to find a fact that was always 100% true no matter what situation. (This is called an objective truth)</p>
<p>Since the brain constantly misinterprets sensory information (eg optical illusions), Descartes concluded that nothing a person senses can be objectively true, everything could possibly be a hallucination and not real at all.</p>
<p>The one objective truth he found was that no matter what his conscious definitely exists, because if it didn’t then obviously Descartes couldn’t be thinking anything at all.</p>
<p>Hence the phrase “I think, therefore I am.” - Even though you can’t be certain anything physically exists, you know your conscious exists in one form or another because you’re able to make thoughts in the first place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Has your brain ever lied to you? It probably has; between sensory illusions, deja vu, hallucinations, dreams, false memories, etc., our perception of what is real is very suspect; your mind plays tricks on you. Descartes basically said that the only thing you can know with any real certainty is that you exist, and you know that because you are the one thinking about existing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many people here are getting this wrong. Descartes reasoned (due to the many philosophical upheavals at the time) that many of our fundamental beliefs are in question, and desired to start from scratch to see what he could absolutely determine as true.</p>
<p>He decided start by doubting everything, even his own existence. But he reasoned that doubting is an act of thought, and that something that doesn't exist cannot think. Thus the reasoning: &quot;I doubt therefore I think, I think therefore I am&quot;.</p>
<p>The problem is that this argument only demonstrates ones own existence. I can use it to demonstrate to myself that I exist, but I cannot use it to demonstrate to you that I exist (and visa versa). This is known as the problem of &quot;Hard Solipsism&quot;, and can essentially be summed up as the idea that you can't actually prove you aren't in a simulation (like the matrix), as all external stimuli (everything your five senses tell you) could potentially be false data fed to you by the simulation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
