		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Amusingly, you have almost certainly experienced the burning sensation of a mucous membrane touching (and dissolving) a solid acid!</p>
<p>Have you ever eaten Sour Patch Kids?  Or Pixie Stix, Sweettarts, or any other sour/sweet candy?  Those all contain solid citric acid, which gives them the sour taste.</p>
<p>Sour Patch Kids (or knockoffs) are the best example because the citric acid crystals are visible on the outside.  In fact, if you suck on the candy for a few seconds instead of chewing immediately, all the crystals will dissolve and you'll find that the gummy interior is... &quot;bland&quot; is the fairest term I can use.</p>
<p>And of course this is why, if you eat too many of any of those candies, your tongue starts to hurt and eventually feel very raw; you're giving yourself acid burns.  So don't overindulge on these.  And brush your teeth, kids!  The acidic environment makes it easier for the bacteria to etch the enamel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Acid/ base reactions, both Lewis and bronstead, absolutely do occur in the solid phase, although the reaction rate is much slower than in solution, due to the diffusion rate being slower. As a matter of fact, these solid phase reactions are quite common and have major industrial applications, such as manufacturing the microchips used in the cell phone I'm typing this on, and  a myriad of other industrial applications. Acids can even be polymers!  Basically, in photolithography, we use a solid matrix including a photo acid, which, when imaged through a mask by light converts into a solid fluorosulfonic super acid. This then catalyses solid phase chemistry which alters the solubility of the matrix, or photoresist. This can then be developed as part of a multistep layering and pattern transfer scheme. This is how all microchips are made. So, yes!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several definitions of an acid.  What you're probably looking for is an Arrhenius acid--a chemical that increases  H3O^+ ions when dissolved in water.  What we're looking for is a solid containing a hydrogen that will ionize when dissolved in water.  One example of this is phosphoric acid.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the other definitions do not define a chemical as an acid by itself.  Instead, they define what acts as an acid or base in a given reaction.  A chemical that is the acid in one reaction might be a base in the other.</p>
<p>Edit:  It might be more appropriate to use the Bronsted-Lowry definition of an acid, which is a H^+ donor.  While it's true that it's the reaction that determines whether something is an acid or a base, there are chemicals that are going to act as acids in basically any scenario.  Phosphorous acid is still a good example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
