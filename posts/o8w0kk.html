	<title>ELI5 - What happens during the lifecycle of a helium balloon when it is let go? When it eventually pops, does the debris fall down (potentially hitting someone) or would it burn it the atmosphere? Does it depend on how high it floats up?</title>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Balloons stay the size they are because of the air around them. If some helium leaks, they get smaller, but if they float up to where there’s less air, they’ll expand. That’s why those big weather balloons always look deflated at ground level, to leave room for expansion. </p>
<p>Now a regular party balloon isn’t like that, so when it floats high enough, it will pop. The rubber that’s left will come down. As far as burning up, let’s talk about terminal velocity. </p>
<p>When something falls, gravity is pulling it toward the earth. But there’s air in the way, so the air will be trying to slow it down. At some point, these two forces balance, and you reach the highest speed possible for that object, known as terminal velocity. For a person or a bowling ball, this can be quite fast. For an autumn leaf or, say, pieces of a rubber balloon, this will be much slower. </p>
<p>So the rubber floats down gently, maybe getting blown around by the wind, before eventually landing on the ground or in the water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A helium balloon wouldn't be able to leave the atmosphere because eventually the balloon would become heavier than the air around it. It also can't fall fast enough upon it popping to create enough air friction to burn up, it just doesn't have the mass.</p>
<p>I'm fairly certain it would eventuality just deflate to the point where it would become heavier than the atmosphere it's in and slowly come back. If it didn't pop already from other reasons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
