		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Economically, the four day work week has two goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Increase the number of people who are working (because you have to hire more people to keep up with demand)</li>
<li>Increase the amount people are spending (because people have more time to use and buy stuff)</li>
</ol>
<p>IF more people are able to find work at reasonable pay, then more people will have money to spend. IF people are also spending more time out of work, they're also likely to have more time to spend in stores, restaurants, and activities that require supplies. In theory, this should mean more goods are needed, purchased, and produced.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This only really applies to typical office settings. There’s A LOT of wasted time in offices. Now being forced to get everything done in 4 days will help keep focus on the work instead of lagging behind.   </p>
<p>Various sites have listed that a good portion of employees surveyed are wasting 1-3 hours a day.
If only an hour a day is completely wasted, that still accounts for half of this theoretical Friday, per person (I personally believe, especially with what I’ve seen, it’s more than just 1 hour a day).  </p>
<p>By wasting less time (googling stuff, watching YouTube, etc...) and instead working, we can give these people three day weekends while maintaining that productivity. We now have the same amount of actual work being done but in less time. So our work output is not decreasing. People are happy they have more leisure time and time for hobbies. What do people do with spare time? They buy stuff for their hobbies, they spend money by traveling, they buy stuff to make the stuff they want to sell, etc...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

What I don't understand what does it have to do with &quot;Covid-19 situation&quot;. If it improves productivity why did not you try it even before the pandemic?
