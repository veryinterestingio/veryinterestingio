<p>Octopuses do change color to camouflage, among other reasons.  They aren't actually sure how they do it.  They see in black and white, so the fact they can match colors is very odd indeed.  There are theories though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This thread is a mess. People barely even understand the question.</p>
<p>To answer the actual question as best I can:<br />
Color-changing animals have special skin-cells called &quot;chromatophores&quot;, which can made to change, either through muscle action (cephalopods) or hormonal signals (chamelon). Those aren't like LED diodes, they can't all just fade through the entire spectrum. Instead, each cell contains a specific color pigment, and depending on how far all cells of this color open, the color of the animal changes. This seems to be a largely involuntary action¹, so the animals don't really &quot;know&quot; when they reached the right color. Instead, there is a stimulus (&quot;the background is black&quot;, for example), and the appropriate, involuntary reaction by the cells follows². </p>
<p>It's like when you trip over a crack in the pavement. You don't &quot;know&quot; what movements to perform to regain your balance. It's just an automatic response to a stimulus that doesn't require your input.³<br />
Of course, it's possible to get that wrong. But natural selection takes care of that. An octopus whose chromatophores color them bright pink on the sandy ground gets eaten and thus their faulty automatic response dies out. A human who trips and just falls over gets eaten by lions, so their faulty automatic response dies out.</p>
<p>¹ Mostly. It seems that cuttlefish can change their color voluntarily, they can be &quot;taught&quot; to change color.</p>
<p>² How they perceive that stimulus is a fascinating topic but not part of the question as far as I understand it.</p>
<p>³ Of course, there is a feedpack loop to the chromatophore response, as there is to every cell process. So something somewhere &quot;knows&quot;, otherwise the cells would just do whatever. But that goes beyond ELI5 and beyond my understanding of cellular biology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People will come in here and tell you that chameleons only change colour because of the temperature or their mood. </p>
<p>I am here to tell you that they do both.</p>
<p>And my source is me, who has owned,  or rather kept, about 40 chameleons over 18 years. This was in different countries in Africa, and I kept different types of chameleons. All the same when it comes to colour changing.</p>
<p>When they get angry they bloat and turn dark. But they will also match colours depending on their environment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
