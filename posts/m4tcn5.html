		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my country, back in the old times, people’s mindset was the more children you have, the more your fortune is. When their children all get to finish college and find a job then they can give back and help their parents financially. They believe their children is their way out of poverty. Many still have that same mindset. </p>
<p>Also another thing is that we don’t have sex education. It’s still an ongoing debate because we’re a “Catholic /Christian country”. So that also explains the never ending increase in unplanned pregnancies. Thinking further about this makes my brain hurt so I’ll just leave it that way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On the level of whole societies' birth rates dropping as their wealth increases, this is a well-studied phenomenon called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition" target="_blank">demographic transition</a>.</p>
<p>Within countries, this is a much weaker effect than stereotypes would potentially lead you to believe. <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/241530/birth-rate-by-family-income-in-the-us/" target="_blank">The poorest households in the US have about 50% more children than the richest</a>, but that's partly because having kids tends to plateau a woman's income (and thus drop her household out of the highest brackets). From the very poorest households to the middle class, the effect is pretty small: 66 kids/1k women in the poorest households to 60/1k women in lower-middle-class ones (i.e., poor people only have about 10% more children than lower-middle-class ones). It's only once you get past that into two-income households with professional women that the number drops off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Higher education leads women to have less children, because they have careers and things to do. In poor countries, women are still expected to stay at home (with all the work it implies) and take care of the children. So, you just make children. Also, if you are educated, you tend to earn more, thus providing for your children and protecting them. You know they're going to live since you can afford food, shelter and medicine. You don't need to make 5 children just to make sure at least 2 of them will survive (it's an exaggeration but you see the idea).</p>
<p>Also, when you're educated properly, you have access to sex education. You know how to access AND use birth control, and you can afford it if you're not poor. When you don't know what you're going to eat, you don't buy condoms. So, the important factors are education and money.<br />
Seriously, so many people put two condoms at once &quot;just to make sure&quot;. It's actually reducing the effectiveness of condoms by tearing them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR; Poverty and reproductive rights are a complex social issue. Historically, domestic violence also referred to as interpersonal relationship violence has oppressed women by forcing them to become pregnant. This creates an environment of economic abuse.</p>
<p>The one social issue I've yet to see mentioned here is the rate of domestic violence among impoverished or disadvantaged populations. A concerning aspect of DV is the use of pregnancy to create an obligation to stay. With each subsequent partner, the pattern continues and women are forced to raise multiple children with different paternal heritage. It is incredibly traumatic for the mother and children to get trapped in this cycle. Due to complex trauma, the family struggles to break free of the constraints of poverty.</p>
<p>The rate of DV among these populations is well documented, as is the recurring cycle that occurs for women. Time constraints as well as limited resources prevent individuals from seeking help. This leads to child abuse and neglect in addition to interpersonal violence and escalating mental health issues. </p>
<p>I should note that DV is not isolated to impoverished environments. Economic abuse is an often overlooked part of DV. This coupled with pregnancy and limited education increases the odds that a woman would stay for the sake of providing for her offspring.</p>
<p>Another note, DV is not isolated to women or heterosexual relationships. There are documented cases of men being tricked into producing offspring with a partner in an attempt to keep him locked into the relationship or otherwise exploit his resources for her gain. From my research on the subject, same-sex partnerships with interpersonal violence rarely include forced reproduction due to the challenges they must overcome to create a child or adopt. Children within a same-sex partnership may experience parental alienation among other issues similar to their counterparts from heterosexual couples dealing with DV.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
