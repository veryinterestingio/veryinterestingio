		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For radio signals to be received correctly, with few errors, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) should be above a certain threshold. The SNR can lowered by decreasing the signal strength (which the tunnel causes) or increasing the noise. For analog signals (AM/FM) as the signal strength drops the quality of the signal becomes worse, which we hear as the static noise drowning out the FM station.</p>
<p>The static you hear (especially at FM frequencies) is mostly made from radio frequency interference (RFI) from the electronics all around us (eg, motors, power supplies, computers). Any electrical device can, and may, produce some amount of radio noise. There is also a thermal noise floor of the radio receiver which limits its sensitivity (but RFI will generally be the stronger interference) and even noise from space (see CMB). All these sources of noise add up to create what we usually call white noise (its the same as the “snow” on an analog TV).</p>
<p>An analogy of white noise is people in a crowd. If you are in the middle of a crowd and everyone is talking you wont be able to pick out any particular conversion but there will be a lot of noise. if someone picks up a megaphone and starts talking into that, you will be able to hear that person above all the background noise (even if the volume of background noise doesn’t change).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You can us visualize the radio spectrum with a device called a software defined radio (SDR) and the cheap ones can be picked up for less than $20 (RTL-SDR).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The radio in your car is designed to take a weak signal and amplify it enough to reach the volume you choose. If the signal is too quiet, the computer automatically amplifies it more to make it louder. If the signal goes away completely, the amplifier just keeps cranking up until whatever extremely faint noise is loud enough to hear. The noise could come from almost anywhere, space, distant radio signals, sparkplugs, even electronic noise from within the radio itself. </p>
<p>Its kind of like wearing a microphone that gets more sensitive as you get quieter, and eventually if you stop talking it picks up your breathing and heartbeat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The hissing noise comes from the transistors in the tuner stage creating noise.
This is produced by (random) thermal decay and excitation resulting in movement of electrons in the substrate.
Most modern tuners have AGC, which mutes the audio stage when the received signal does below a certain level.
Some spurious signals will make it through (e.g. flickering lights, arcs, lightning, car ignition or other impulses).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is true for both AM and FM - but, as I'm sure you've noticed, AM is more prone to static.</p>
<p>There are two source:</p>
<p>1) Things like fluorescent lights and your auto ignition system are weak sources of radio noise - so those can contribute.</p>
<p>2) The electronic devices that amplify the signal generate noise.  Failing any other signal, Automatic Gain Control will can amplify that noise enough to hear.</p>
<p>There are several different types of electronic amplifiers.  The kind used for the first stage of radio amplification are &quot;Low Noise Amplifiers&quot; - but &quot;low Noise&quot; doesn't mean &quot;No Noise&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's take an example of 1000 AM station, that is a carrier of 1MHz, and bandwidth of approx 10kHz (the actual signal/ music)</p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Amfm3-en-de.gif" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Amfm3-en-de.gif</a></p>
<p>Your radio takes from 990kHz to 1010kHz and demodulates it down to audio ranges (let's say 500Hz to 10kHz)</p>
<p>When you go into a ~tunnel or underpass~ waveguide,  the radio signals cannot travel there (for the same reason you can see what's going on inside a working microwave oven)</p>
<p>So what happens depends on the radio, but basically the signal is too small, so you cannot demodulates anything meaningful, and there is probably some automatic gain stage, so you amplify what remains.</p>
<p>That could be RF noise near the carrier frequency, it could be noise in the amplifier or diodes or LPF, or general noise like spark from engine or alternator brushes.</p>
<p>tl;dr
It's like assigning pixels a random value and looking at a photo. Or using your camera in low light, but the audio equivalent</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
