		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you take a bunch of nails and throw them in a box, they are all tangled and pointing in different directions. Shake the box and they start to align themselves into rows, facing the same direction.</p>
<p>This is what heating and hammering does to metal... you heat it up to spread the molecules out and hammer it to get the molecules to fall in line. </p>
<p>These &quot;grained&quot; molecules have better, stronger connections to eachother and therefore the metal is stronger.</p>
<p>EDIT: adding an edit here because it has been brought up a number of times... quenching and tempering are used to make steel harder, that is correct. However, the question being asked here is casting vs hammer forging, that is the question I am answering.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Thanks for the awards Reddit friends!</p>
<p>EDIT 3: <a href="https://youtu.be/A4zsoA5kjCo" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/A4zsoA5kjCo</a> (video of shaking a box of nails)</p>
<p>EDIT 4: one last edit and I'm done. No they arent molecules they are arranged in lattices... this is ELI5... no wonder this sub usually sucks... too many people with inflated opinion of themselves to realize the point is to make the explanation as simple as possible. Does saying molecules vs atoms in a lattice formation make more sense easily to a 5 year old? You bet your sweet bippy it does. Does it matter in the grand scheme of the difference between the two? Not a single bit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For an analogy (obviously not a perfect one), think about pizza dough. </p>
<p>Why not just mix the flour and water together a little bit and pour it onto a pizza-sized platter? Why spend all that effort kneading it and stretching it out? Because kneading and stretching the dough changes the form of the gluten molecules, making them all stretchy. It gives the pizza crust that nice chewy texture.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bronze blades were in fact made that way. Then simply needed cleaning up after being cast.  Iron and steel donâ€™t have good metallurgical properties when cast, though. They go through molecular changes when forged that give them the combination of hardness and springiness needed to be a good blade.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of the answers here are close but none are completely correct. Metals are crystalline meaning all the atoms are arranged and spaced in a predictable ordered array. In a perfect theoretical crystal, every single atom would line up perfectly with the next, however in this is not usually the case in most pieces of metal, and would actually make the metal weaker. When all the planes of atoms line up perfectly, it makes it easier for them to slide past each other when the metal is under stress, effectively allowing the metal to deform. But if you have smaller crystalline regions in the metal that are misaligned with each other, the atoms can't slide past each other and lock up at the regions in between these small crystals, known as grain boundaries, preventing further deformation. When a blacksmith beats a red hot piece of metal, they continuously fold and flatten the piece of metal, refining the small crystalline grains in the material, making them smaller and stronger, so there is a higher chance that they will lock up if the metal is stressed. A cast or melted piece of metal has larger grains than a hammered piece of metal, as the atoms have time to organize their structure as it cools, which weakens it significantly. If you've ever seen a galvanized metal street pole or roadside barrier you can actually see the individual grains on the surface as they are very large. Most swords would probably have grains under 1 millimeter across, probably smaller. If you want more info on this look into grain boundary strengthening.
