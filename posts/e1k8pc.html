		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR; It is correct because we say it is correct. We keep using it because it is good at what it does.</p>
<p><strong>This is not a stupid question</strong>. This is in fact one of the most profound questions ever asked and humanity may never know the answer to it.</p>
<p>Math is a language used to convey relationships like one thing is the same as another thing. It is one of the most beautiful languages every made because it is based on some simple statements called <strong>Axioms</strong>. An axiom is something that is true because we say it is. There is no other requirement needed. Let's play with some axioms and do non-mathy versions too:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: left;">Mathy Version</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">Non-mathy Version</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Reflexive Axiom</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">a = a</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The color of the sky is the color of the sky</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Symmetric Axiom</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">a = b therefore b = a</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The color of the sky is blue so blue is the color of the sky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Transitive Axiom</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">a = b, b = c therefore a = c</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The color of the sky is blue and my shoes are blue. Therefore my shoes are the color of the sky.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>There isn't any universal truth in any of those statements. We could say that the color of the sky is red, taupe, banana, or florg and the statements are all still true only because we say they are. The assumption may be wrong (the sky obviously is not banana) but we say it is true so it is true. You can make any axioms you want but if they don't do a good job at describing things then it'll be hard to get other people to use them.</p>
<p>All of math is based around a few axioms. The amazing thing is that these simple things we say are true, allow us to perfectly describe the universe with such amazing precision that we have to ask is the universe made of math or do we make math to describe the universe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mmmm yes and no.</p>
<p>This is a little difficult to explain, but basically the math we use is a lot like the language we speak. When we talk to each other, what's important is the information we can tell each other. So we agreed to use certain words to mean certain things, so that we can exchange information.</p>
<p>This &quot;language of math&quot; is just a way to get information from the world around us. Like, 2 meters doesn't mean anything unless you understand what the number 2 means, and how long a meter is. But once you understand this, the math has meaning.</p>
<p>We use this understanding to measure tests on the universe, and created rules based on true and false laws (logic), to organize the information we get through math, to try and make sense of what we see. &quot;Force = Mass*acceleration&quot;, because the units we decided on both sides match up, and as long as they stay that way, we can use this rule.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mathematician here.  Great question.</p>
<p>Most responses so far have focused on answering your question about &quot;random lines and curves&quot;.  And yes, the specific shapes and figures we use are just that - shapes and figures.  People came to agree on certain symbols so we could communicate.</p>
<p>But I think the first part of your question is more important: how do we know our maths is accurate?  And the answer is ultimately: we <em>choose</em> what maths we use so that it'<em>s</em> as accurate as we can get it.</p>
<p>This falls under the field of &quot;theory of formal systems&quot;.  What's a formal system?  Simply a set of symbols with a set of rules that manipulate those symbols.  That's what math is.  That's it.  We use a bunch of random squiggles and put them together in a row and we use rules to make new rows of symbols.</p>
<p>Then why is this useful?  Well, we can <em>design</em> these rules to describe what we see in the world around us, and then doing these little games with the symbols can actually help us predict what else we'll see in the world.  We could, and do, design thousands of systems with all sorts of different rules and tricks, but most of them wouldn't line up with our reality.  And in many times throughout history have we learned something new about reality (ex. quantum theory) and had to invent <em>new</em> math to help us work with it.</p>
<p>So when someone says 1+1=2 is a <em>true</em> statement about our reality...that's not quite correct.  It's &quot;true&quot; in a formal system sense because it follows the rules of that system, and then we use that system because it lines up well with our observations.  If 1+1=5 worked better, we would be using that instead!  But by no means did we ever open up the &quot;control panel of the universe&quot; and see &quot;1+1=2&quot; etched on the cover there for us to discover, or something like that :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The symbols we use to represent numbers and how to manipulate them are arbitrary. But the whole point of mathematics is to understand the underlying relations that hold true regardless how you represent things. That's why mathematicians use logical proofs to add things to the mathematical body of knowledge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are whole fields of study that relate to this, and a lot of disagreements in those fields.</p>
<p>The simplest answer is that we made them up to be correct. The more complicated answer is we made up math, then used that as a language to describe physics, and then is compared to observation, which has largely shown us our math is correct.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
