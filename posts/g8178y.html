		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine four points on a plane, like the corners of a square. Connect those four points with lines to make a square with an X connecting the opposite corners. You are allowed to use two different colors for those lines, red and blue. The goal is to make that square+X <em>without</em> having all of the lines be the same color.</p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/60/GrahamCube.svg/220px-GrahamCube.svg.png" target="_blank">Here is the diagram from the Wikipedia article on Graham's Number to help illustrate what's going on.</a></p>
<p>Can you do it? With a 2-dimensional square, of course! It's easy.</p>
<p>Now imagine a 3D cube. Do the same thing - connect all of the points with lines so that you create six squares+X, one on each cube face, plus several more connecting opposing corners. We're not concerned with the 3D shapes that you make with these lines, just the 2D squares. Once again, is it possible to do this without accidentally making one of the squares with all the same color lines?</p>
<p>Once again, the answer is yes, of course. So what about a 4-dimensional hypercube? Or a 5-dimensional superhypercube? Or 6D? 7D? 8D? At some point, with some number of dimensions, it will become impossible. Somewhere among the many, <em>many</em> 2D squares made with the lines there will eventually be one that is made with lines of the same color. So, how many dimensions do you have to add to the &quot;game&quot; to make this a certainty?</p>
<p>The answer is, nobody knows. It's <em>really</em> hard to figure it out and far too complex to brute force it with a computer testing each number of dimensions. What they <em>do</em> know is the lower bound and upper bound. The lower bound is the minimum number that mathematicians know when it <em>might</em> be the case, and the upper bound is the number where they know it is <em>definitely</em> the case. It could be less than that; it probably <em>is</em> less than that, but mathematicians are <em>certain</em> that it happens at the upper bound.</p>
<p>Graham's Number is that upper bound. It is <em>definitely</em> the case that if you have a &quot;hypercube&quot; of dimensions equal to Graham's Number, you will make one of those square+X shapes with lines of the same color no matter how hard you try not to.</p>
<p>Graham's Number has never actually been calculated. It's too big. Mathematicians have figured out the last like, 100 digits or something, though.</p>
<p>To get to Graham's Number, you need a special notation, an up arrow: ↑. That represents taking the power of something, so 3↑3 is the same as 3^(3). Following that, 3↑↑3 is 3↑(3↑3) (or 3^3^3 ), 7,625,597,484,987. EDIT: Thanks for the correction u/jaydfox.</p>
<p>So, take 3↑↑↑3, which is equal to 3↑↑(3↑↑3). That's a <em>big ass number</em>. That is not Graham's Number. That number is the number of arrows to use again. So 3↑^(3↑↑↑3)3. Take <em>that</em> number - which is already bigger than 10^100 (a googol, which itself is larger than the number of particles in the observable universe), and use it again to define the number of arrows. Repeat this until you've done it a total number of 64 times. <em>That</em> is Graham's Number. To say that it is very large is an understatement. If you wrote a googol on every particle in the observable universe and then added them all together, it would be a lot less than Graham's Number.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer is, however big a number you could possibly imagine, it's bigger. Seriously. It's not even useful to say that some enormous figure like the number of atoms in the universe &quot;doesn't come close&quot;, because that suggests that maybe something else does come close. Nothing does. Nothing we can imagine even vaguely takes you near the scale of Graham's number. </p>
<p>Even those kinds of stories you can invent, where something takes an unbelievably long time, and then you stack them together. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>every 1000 years, a man takes a teaspoon of water out of the ocean.</li>
<li>when all the earth's oceans are depleted, a sheet of paper is placed on the ground and the oceans are refilled. the process continues until another sheet is added to the stack. </li>
<li>when the stack of paper reaches the sun, I take a single atom from Jupiter, and the stack begins anew.</li>
<li>when Jupiter is all gone, I do something else</li>
<li>etc, etc, </li>
</ul>
<p>It still doesn't matter. What I choose for each step, how many steps I string together, it just doesn't make a difference. The time, in years or in nanoseconds, is still incomprehensibly far away from Graham's number.</p>
<p>So now that we've established it's a hopelessly futile endeavor, it is a real and specific number that was used in a legitimate mathematical proof. So it can be understood in some way. I'll leave that to other commenters since I don't know the details of the problem it solves. But what I can help with is how it's written down, and just how quickly trying to get there working up from regular numbers blows up. </p>
<p>To discuss Graham's number we will use a notation commonly called the &quot;up-arrow&quot;, but I don't know how to write that in reddit so it hardly matters. The important point is that it sort of extends the relationship between addition, multiplication, and exponentiation.</p>
<p>To multiply a number by some other number <em>n</em>, you add the first number to itself <em>n</em> times. For example 4x5 = 4+4+4+4+4. This we're all familiar with. </p>
<p>Similarly, to exponentiate we multiply some number of times in a row. For example 4^5 = 4x4x4x4x4. This grows a LOT faster than multiplication. </p>
<p>So the up-arrow concept extends this further. If we call exponentiation &quot;order 0&quot;, then the &quot;order 1&quot; operation would be to exponentiate a number of times in a row.</p>
<p>3 (order 1) 3 is the example i'll use. This would be 3^(3^3) -- evaluating from the top down, that becomes 3^27 which is something like 7.6 trillion. This blows up even more quickly than exponentiation, of course.</p>
<p>Now to order 2. That would be 3 (order 1) (3 (order 1) 3). We already know the top part, so we have 3 (order 1) 7.6 trillion. And this is where things go from big, to impossible. </p>
<p>3^(3^3) already blew up fast. Adding another 3, we'd have 3 to the power of 7.6 trillion. This is a number with trillions of digits. Just storing it would take a modern hard drive in full, let alone computing it. But still, it's at least <em>imaginable</em>, in some sense.</p>
<p>Add another 3. We're up to 3 (order 1) 5 now, and pretty much out of luck. Just stating the number of digits this number has requires an understanding of the actual scale of 3 (order 1) 4, which was already a big reach. Writing down 3 (order 1) 5 is not physically possible in the observable universe. Just expressing the number of digits it has is a significant endeavor.</p>
<p>Back to order 2, in case you forgot where we were. We wanted 3 (order 1) 7.6 trillion, and the limits of our comprehension fell vastly short by the time we got to 5. It's impossible to overstate how fast this number blows up as we try to get to 7.6 trillion. At this point all we can do is talk about it. </p>
<p>To start talking about Graham's number, we need order 3. Specifically, 3 (order 3) 3 just like the previous examples. I'm not even going to try and imagine this one, just suffice to say it's out of reach. Everything I said at the beginning about Graham's number is true of this number too. Hell, it was true of order 2.</p>
<p>3 (order 3) 3 is called G_1, and we define the set G recursively:</p>
<p>G_(n+1) = 3 (order G_n) 3</p>
<p>Somewhat beautifully, this means we can think of G_0 as 3 itself.</p>
<p>To recap, G_0 = 3, and G_1 is already immeasurably far from comprehension. To try and compute it, you're very quickly doomed because the order 1 operation blows up immeasurably faster than exponents, and the order 2 immeasurably faster than that, and so on. The G set itself uses the previous value as the <em>order</em> of the operation to generate each next value. G_2 involves an order G_1 calculation. We're not even well equipped to talk about how fast this G set blows up. And we couldn't get off the ground with computing G_1.</p>
<p>Graham's number is G_64.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's quite literally mindblowing how large it is. Graham's number is so big that storing it in your head would make it turn into a black hole. </p>
<p>Information is equivalent to a really small amount of energy. That energy is equivalent to even less mass. If you take Graham's number however, there is so much information and therefore mass in your head that the Schwarzschild radius is larger than the radius of your head, therefore your head becomes a black hole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
