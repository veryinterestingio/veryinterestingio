This way, they can find food easily. However, how is that possible? How can only a few drops of blood diffuse into the ocean and the sharks are still be able to sense everything?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Shark olfaction is fairly sensitive--although it varies by the species. They can detect very small amounts of a chemical within the water, which undoubtedly is advantageous for hunting. </p>
<p>However, in order for the shark to actually detect said chemical (e.g., trace amounts of blood in the water), it needs to actually physically encounter it. </p>
<p>So, if you cut your finger and start bleeding, it's not like sharks within 1+ kilometer distance will all start swimming towards you because they haven't actually physically encountered blood in the water. It would require a steady stream of blood leading from you to it. </p>
<p>Another way to think about this is how we detect stars in the sky with our vision. If a star forms today, and it's 1 million light years away from earth, we won't know that the star has formed until light rays travel far enough to reach earth (i.e., 1 million years from now).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Science vs had an episode where they talked about this.  Basically, it's bullshit.  They do have somewhat sensitive noses but no they can't sense a drop in the ocean and they certainly can't do so from miles away.  Iirc they can't even manage a drop in a swimming pool that they're in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This statement is often repeated, but very misleading. If you take a drop of blood and drop it in the ocean, sharks in the area aren't suddenly going to know about it. </p>
<p>Sharks do have a very good sense of smell. They can smell very small amounts of stuff. The source of this statement comes from measuring the volumes. If the volume of a drop of blood were evenly dispersed into a large body of water, a shark would be able to smell it and orient itself in the direction where it smelled stronger (most likely the source).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
