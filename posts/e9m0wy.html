The oldest parts of the crust in the Earth's main oceans are about 150 million years old -- that's how long &quot;From when the newest crust emerges on one end all the way to being subverted on the other&quot;.</p>
<p>But when you say &quot;full cycle&quot; you might also be interested in how long it takes a given rock molecule to make a full circle from erupting to subducting to erupting again.  That's trickier, because the plate material gets mixed up in the mantle, and some bits return to the surface quicker than others, but the mantle is huge, so the average cycle time is probably longer than the age of the Earth.</p>
<p>Edited to add: lots of people are asking &quot;how come we have fossils older than 150 million years?&quot;  Answer: because the number I gave is for the crust at the bottom of the ocean.  Continental crust generally doesn't get recycled into the mantle -- it &quot;floats on top&quot;.  So 150 million years is just the recycling time for the parts of the crust that actually do recycle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few years since I studied this, so perhaps someone with more current knowledge can help out.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of how long it takes to subduct a plate - the fastest subduction in the world is going on along the Kermadec-Tonga subduction zones at a dizzying 24cm per year. Though speeds vary widely - old, cold oven Crust is rapidly subducted along steep subduction zones because it has a relatively high density; young ocean crust only sinks grudgingly. The rate at which the plate sinks into the Mantle also varies - a fast sinking slab might go down by as much as 10cm per year.</p>
<p>It's hard to say what eventually happens to subducted slabs because there is still some uncertainty as to when they eventually merge with the surrounding Mantle. At shallow depths, they can be plotted using seismic data and they show up very well as they first plunge into the Mantle, being both colder and denser than the surrounding rock, but they become less distinct below about 660km as they warm up, lose water and their minerals change. </p>
<p>What exactly happens next is unclear - some theories have them breaking up below about 660km or moving horizontally through the Mantle - the Southern Kurile and Izuâ€“Bonin subduction zones suggest this could go on. Other, such as the Central America and Sunda zones appear to go much deep - certainly beyond 1700km and possibly down to the Core-Mantle Boundary, but they gradually become more diffuse regions of sinking, cooler material probably made up of subducted plate and cooled Mantle. </p>
<p>Other theories suggest that discontinuities in the Mantle at 660, 900 - 1000 and 1600km are 'slab graveyards' where the subducted plates float and gradually dissolve back into the Mantle.</p>
<p>Early plate tectonic theories had subducted plates breaking up at relatively shallow depths with material being recycled back to the surface. If plates do go much deeper then the recycling times are much longer - in the orders of billions of years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doing some searches and coming up blank trying to find illustrative images, but a couple years ago there were a number of papers using tomographic imaging of seismic waves through the earth's mantle showing pieces of crustal rock moderately deep in the mantle 200-600 km that the scientists believed were the remains of &quot;lost&quot; continents that had been pushed down into the mantle in subduction zones --ie where one tectonic plate is sliding underneath another plate. These exist in several places in the world -e.g. on the western edge of south america, below the himalayan plateau. These plates of continental crust gradually melt and diffuse into the mantle, or having melted, convect back up to form new crust.  The tomographic imaging reveals the &quot;fossil&quot; remains of old continents . The paper I recall reading labeled some of these fossil image as the remains of crustal rock dating from 600 MYA - suggesting that the answer to your question for how long for a complete recycle can be longer than that - e.g. 500 M to 1 Billion years, perhaps longer</p>
<p>---EDIT---<br />
Here's an educational paper showing a tomographic image of a subducted plate, but not a description of its age
<a href="http://www.usarray.org/files/docs/Education/es_tomography.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.usarray.org/files/docs/Education/es_tomography.pdf</a></p>
<p>Here's another paper cataloging the &quot;sinking slabs&quot; in the mantle detected and mapped from tomographic imaging.  It gives a much younger interpretation of the ages of these slabs than what I've indicated above 50-200 MYA.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, that's a interesting point. Do tectonic plates move like a conveyor belt (new plate arrives one side and old plate disappears at the other) or do they oscillate around like lilly pads and the edges and switch between converging, diverging and sliding based on which direction they are currently traveling?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I could be wrong about this, but I think that in some (most?) cases, tectonic plates <em>don't</em> fully subduct. Instead, they sort of bounce off each other and eventually change direction. The parts of the plates that avoided subduction (and other geologic processes) are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craton" target="_blank">cratons</a> and/or <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shield_(geology\)" target="_blank">shields</a>. IIRC, parts of the Australian Shield are up to 4 billion years old.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
