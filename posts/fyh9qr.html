		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So... This is an interesting one. During my high-school days, most of us here in India couldn't afford a decent calculator. We all had one of those cheap ones that can do basic BODMAS and additionally, square roots. Log books were also rare and used to go out of stock pretty fast.</p>
<p>There is this brilliant trick that used to work perfectly to find the log₁₀ of any number upto 3 digits on this regular calculator:</p>
<ol>
<li>Type the number.</li>
<li>Recursively take its square root 19 times.</li>
<li>Subtract one.</li>
<li>Multiply the result by 227697.</li>
</ol>
<p>And miraculously, it gave the log₁₀(x) accurate upto 4/5 decimal places. Sometimes even more. How does this work?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's how I reverse engineered it (and then reverse these steps back to see how it was first made). I'll use ~ to denote &quot;approximately&quot;</p>
<p>The trick basically says: </p>
<p>227697( x^(1/2^19) -1) ~ log_10 x</p>
<p>Natural logs are what you always want to work with, so I multiply both sides by ln 10, we get:</p>
<p>524292 ( x^(1/2^19) -1) ~ ln x</p>
<p>Now that constant in the front is very close to 2^19 = 524288, so we get to:</p>
<p>2^19 ( x^(1/2^19) -1) ~ ln x</p>
<p>Divide both sides by 2^19, and let u = x^(1/2^19):</p>
<p>u - 1 ~ ln u</p>
<p>which is true near u=1 (which can be seen by taking the tangent of ln u at u=1, or by Taylor series). For x &lt; 1000, x^(1/2^19) is very close to 1, which is why this approximation is so good. </p>
<p>If you didn't need quite as many digits, you could similarly find appropriate constants to only have to recursively square root fewer than 19 times. For example, </p>
<p>444.72 (x^(1/2^10) - 1) ~ log_10 x</p>
<p>should be a decent approximation as well. Written in terms of the steps in a hand calculator, it would be:</p>
<p>1) Recursively square root 10 times
2) Subtract 1
3) Multiply by 444.72</p>
<p>This gives you 2 dp accuracy for x &lt; 10, which is all you need for the approximation anyway because we can apply the identity:</p>
<p>log_10 (a * 10^n ) = n + log_10 a</p>
<p>So e.g. log_10 (724) = 2 + log_10 (7.24). The approximation with 10 recursively square roots gives the correct result to 2dp.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks for the awards pals, appreciate them all :) </p>
<p>Another note - by tweaking OPs constant of 227697 to 227695, we can go from 4dp accuracy to 6dp accuracy!

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can often construct accurate approximations of certain functions using less complicated functions. These will be fairly accurate but not equal. </p>
<p>If you were to plot your approximation (which is (x^(0.5^19) - 1) * 227697) next to log10(x), you'll find that it's a fairly good approximation for even inputs of 9 digits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You've discovered the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis" target="_blank">Numerical Analysis</a>! Basically, <em>all</em> computers can only do addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. So humans have come up with all kinds of ways to compute <em>approximations</em> for more complicated functions like log, cosine, square root, zeros or min/max values of functions, etc. using only those basic building blocks of arithmetic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So this is more like an ELI16, but this is going to be hard to explain satisfyingly without a bit of maths! And no five year old knows what a logarithm is anyway...</p>
<p>One definition of the exponential function is,</p>
<p>e^y = lim(n--&gt;infinity) (1 + y/n)^n</p>
<p>So if you have y = ln(x), that is, x = e^y, then you can approximate:</p>
<p>x = (1 + y/n)^n </p>
<p>with n chosen to be very large.</p>
<p>Then some rearrangement gives:</p>
<p>y = ln(x) = n(x^(1/n) - 1) = n(^(n)√x -1)</p>
<p>By taking the square root 19 times in a row, you were actually taking the 2^(19)th root. Then, you multiplied it by a number that just happens to be 2^19 / ln(10). Why? Because log₁₀(x) = ln(x)/ln(10). So this is just the method with n = 2^(19).</p>
<p>The more times you take that square root - or the larger the number in place of 19 - the better the approximation will be. Except, at some point, you run into the accuracy of the calculator: 1 + dx will be rounded to 1, and the calculation will fail. On a cheap calculator, you might expect it to use the standard known as &quot;single precision&quot; (aka 32-bit floating point), which has a relative accuracy of 2^(-23). So you don't want ln(x)/n to be too close to this value if you want get an accurate answer. That's why this method stops at n = 2^(19), presumably. </p>
<p>The way to test this would be to see how many square roots until your calculator rounds to 1: you'd want to stop quite a few times before that to get a good result, and in fact the optimal number of times will be about half that limiting number.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
