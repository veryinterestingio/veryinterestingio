<p>Whatever it is, in most major cities the area around the major bus/coach station is always a scary place to be at night. What’s the connection? </p></div></div>

<p>Cheap land near the city center? It's going to be a rough neighborhood, because the nice parts are expensive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One reason is because people living in lower socioeconomic neighborhoods often do not have the experience, wealth or network to fight zoning that results in bus depots, factories and other higher pollution-producing venues from being located in their neighborhood. Studies have shown that families who live close to bus depots, etc., have a higher rate of asthma and other illnesses that can be linked to the pollution in their neighborhoods. <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hpb20111006.957918/full/" target="_blank">Here is one report on it.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a business, you always want to manage your resources as efficiently as possible. A bus business needs a lot of area to store their buses and it needs to be within a reasonable distance of where the buses are going to operate. But that's it. The business could spend more money for a &quot;nicer&quot; location, but it's not an efficient use of their money, since the place where they store the buses being &quot;nice&quot; isn't very important to their success.</p>
<p>You might compare this to a business like Starbucks, which derives almost all of their value from having prime locations where tired commuters are happy to pay for extremely expensive coffee just because it's right next to where they happen to be every morning. Starbucks pay almost nothing for the actual coffee, and only a &quot;small&quot; amount for the employees, but they spend a lot of money on the location, because in their case that's an efficient use of their money.</p>
<p>There is surely a bit of a chicken and egg problem, regardless of bus depots, &quot;nice&quot; locations tend to stay and become nicer and &quot;poor&quot; locations tend to stay and become poorer. The bus depot may help keep the area cheap. But to answer your question, the area was cheap before the bus depot, that's why the bus depot chose it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
