<p>Yes.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Yes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>possibly leading to fission (or induce alpha/beta decay in fitting isotopes) or fusion of several</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes to all of those except fusion. You can induce nuclear reactions with gamma rays, or just excite the nucleus such that it decays someway other than gamma emission. But for fusion to happen, you need two <em>nuclei</em> to collide, not a nucleus and a gamma ray.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I don't see how it would aid in initiating fusion. Unless you mean to start the initial ionization of the plasma in a magnetic confinement reactor, but I think there are much better ways to do this than to use gamma rays.</p>

<p>There is a lot of work being done in x-ray free electron lasers (XFELs). We can produce high energy gamma rays as well using accelerators, for example <a href="http://www.tunl.duke.edu/web.tunl.2011a.higs.php" target="_blank">using Compton backscattering</a>. They can produce gamma rays with hundreds of MeV of energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The use of gamma rays to induce fission in nuclei is called photofission. Theoretically, it could be possible to build a reactor that that can get power from unrefined uranium or nuclear waste using photofission.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.meridian-int-res.com/Energy/PhotonReactor.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.meridian-int-res.com/Energy/PhotonReactor.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.meridian-int-res.com/Energy/PhotonReactor.pdf</a></a></p>
<p>Exciting the nuclei won't help with fusion directly but a gamma ray beam could create an inertially confined fusion reaction. If a deuterium lithium pellet is coated in fissionable material such as uranium a gamma-ray source could induce fission in the uranium adding energy to help implode the fusion fuel.</p>

<p>This is a design for a <em>fission</em> (not fusion) power plant, that does not have enough fissile material to sustain a reaction. That is obviously a huge benefit when doing safety-analysis.</p>
<p>A particle accelerator provides <em>neutrons</em> (not gamma rays) to trigger <em>fission</em> &quot;on demand&quot;, as you say.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nuclei have quantised energy levels just like the electrons on the outside of an atom do, just on a vastly different energy scale. There is one nuclear transition however, to a metastable state in thorium, which is almost in the visible spectrum (its actually in the UV). Researchers have been trying for years to accurately characterise it and use it as a clock, much more accurate than the caesium standard. The main limitation at the moment is how hard it is to build coherent UV lasers with a narrow enough frequency range to look at it (and the fact that UV lasers burn all your optics regularly)

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mostly yes, maybe not so much on the usefulness for fusion.</p>
<p>Energy level transistions in the nucleus are associated with gamma rays of the same energy. Transitions to lower energy states will result in the emission of a photon of that energy, and conversely the nucleus can make those same transitions upwards when provided with sufficient energy.</p>
<p>We can and do make use of this for gamma ray and X ray absorption spectroscopy: exposing targets to high energy photons and measuring which are absorbed, which can actually be used to reveal information about chemical structure because of the very small perturbations in energy levels that result from an atom's interactions with its surroundings. This allows us to study things like details of the nucleis' interaction with their electron shells, or the electrochemical environment inside of a crystal. The equipment and experimental techniques are developed enough to be used as a classroom demonstration or experiment for undergraduate nuclear physics.</p>
<p>In inertial confinement fusion it is actually more useful to use lower frequency photons as we want to deliver a lot of energy to the fuel pellet wall as opposed to selectively exciting nuclear states.</p>
<p>But, for studying the physics of nuclear energy levels and nuclear decay processes, it's a viable technique. There is even a method called Mossbauer Spectroscopy that takes advantage of the extremely small doppler shift in the gamma rays emitted by a moving radioactive source to perform ultra high resolution spectroscopy, which can distinguish nuclear energy level shifts on the order of a few eV.</p>
