		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body's metabolism slows overnight and concentrates more on digestion and other background tasks.</p>
<p>Because you're all wrapped up, the body doesn't need to generate as much heat, so it switches off a bit, and you get comfy because the blankets and you have been equalising in temperature for hours.</p>
<p>But when you're awake and active your heart rate rises, your body temp rises, you're generating friction and moving muscles and the conversion of stored energy ramps up, and you're exposed to the outside air, so you need to ramp up heat production too.  Don't forget, you sleep at night when the temperatures are very different to the day.</p>
<p>Then you spend not-long-enough under a blanket but those mechanisms haven't had a chance to slow down, they're still going strong keeping you ready at any moment to dash out and catch food while the day is still light.  Put a blanket round and it'll be hours before you acclimatise, and doing so will happen as you become sleepy and your body realises it doesn't need to be alert and active.</p>
<p>Going back to bed in the day can be a sweaty horrible affair, if you don't slow down for a long time first (collapse on sofa, have a drink, watch TV, whatever).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This seems really strange then that I am the complete opposite. I feel much warmer if I wake in the middle of the night having just been asleep, then I do when I've been awake for a while under the same sheets. In particular my feet are always cold, except when I fall asleep, then they get warm. </p>
<p>I guessed that it was because i relaxed more during night, and less tension makes the blood flow better, but reading the comments in this thread until now doesn't quite fit with this behavior.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I always chalked it up to being an active sleeper. I've injured my hand twice while dreaming. Once from punching a nightstand while trying to thwart a car thief that wasn't there. Second was from trying to slap myself awake. It worked, but only because the first attempt didn't work so I tried again, ended up missing and hitting the headboard instead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
