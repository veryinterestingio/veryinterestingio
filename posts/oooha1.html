		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several reasons why seafood spoils faster than meat from animals that live on the dry part of the earth. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fish has a higher content of water than meat, so it's easier for bacteria to find a home here, as most bacteria prefer a wetter environment to thrive in. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fish doesn't have a lot of collagen, so bacteria find it easier to penetrate the flesh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fish contains a lot of poly-unsaturated fats (like the well-known omega-3 fatty acids) which makes it healthy, but these fats also spoil faster (they have several double bonds which makes them oxidise easier).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lots of fish live in cold water, so the enzymes that break down fish meat are used to the cold. Storing fish at regular fridge temperatures doesn't slow down rotting as well as storing meat in the fridge does. Storing fish on ice is better, but still not as effective as storing meat in the fridge (2-7 degrees Celcius).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All animals store energy as glycogen in their muscles. In general, land animals don't fight a lot before being killed, but fish do. So, fish deplete their glycogen supplies and turn it into readily available energy in the form of glucose in the bloodstream. Turns out bacteria love to feast on glucose.
EDIT: as several others have pointed out, this can be prevented by killing fish in a more humane way, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikejime" target="_blank">ikejime</a>. Thanks everyone for sharing this piece of knowledge!</p>
</li>
<li>EDIT: u/th3cr1t1c pointed out one more important reason! One other thing to watch out for is that fish in the Scombridae family (includes mackerel, tuna, bonito/skipjack) release histamine into the flesh even after death. Thorough cooking does not mitigate this since it's not a bacteria you're trying to kill off... It's when raw scombroid fish are handled at temperatures above 40ºF (4ºC) at any point in the process from stream to table that it can be dangerous to consume.</li>

<p>EDIT: Changed RDN to Registered Dietitian Nutritionist, as indeed it's not a generally known abbreviation. Also, figured out how to turn * into bullet points :)</p>
<p>EDIT2: Wow, this blew up :) Thanks for all the replies and the awards, very much appreciated! I tried to answer to everyone to the best of my knowledge. Please let me know if I didn't reply to you yet, my inbox suddenly was, well, fuller than it had ever been. Thanks to u/GLEN25801 for asking a question that I happened to know an answer to!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An answer I'm not seeing here is slaughter method.  And there's very easily observable evidence of this.</p>
<p>In America, beef is king.  And it is treated as such.  There are strict rules and regulations surrounding the slaughter of cows to be as humane and quick as possible.  Typically this involves a calming introduction to the killing line (Temple Grandin method), a stunning phase where the animal is rendered senseless immediately (captive bolt gun typically) and then the animal is immediately bled and hung and processed.  Almost all four-legged animals are then hung upside down at which point gravity can help break up the rigor mortis process.  This conserves a great deal of the ATP in the animal's cells as it has not struggled in death which slows the build up of lactic acid.  The bleeding of the animal helps to flush and prevent bacterial growth and by all accounts this improves every facet of the animal's meat in eating.  This is why you can age a large primal cut of beef in some instances for over a year.</p>
<p>Perciform fish rarely get the same treatment, especially in the Western world.  The vast, vast majority of fish are trawled in a massive net or purse seine, or they are gill netted where they struggle against thousands of pounds of other panicked fish or they die a slow, painful death on the line until they are hauled in.  After this frenzied struggle they are typically dumped en masse on to a boat deck to suffocate to death and bake in the sun.  This poor method of slaughter causes immense stress to the animal and does the exact opposite of what we discussed with beef.  All ATP is consumed and converted into lactic acid, fish are rarely bled, they go immediately into rigor and then they form favorable conditions for bacteria to grow.</p>
<p>But in Japan, tuna is king.  A quick Google search of ikejime or shinkeijime will show you how fish should be treated.  They are hauled in quickly on a line, they are stunned or spiked to cause instant brain death and then their gills are cut while their heart is still beating to pump out all of the blood.  Then they immediately go into an ice slurry to bring their body temperature down.</p>
<p>Properly slaughtered fish can then be aged for a great deal of time and they age much like a steak would with complex proteins breaking down into savory glutamic acid via favorable enzyme activity.  This is what makes top tier sushi so delicious, it is simply impossible to develop those sorts of flavors in a fish that was killed that morning.  Not that fresh fish is bad or tastes bad, but it's just sort of been a Band-Aid signal of quality that never addressed the root issue of the problem, that being poor handling practices.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fish live in the cold.  Things like cod, salmon, haddock, tuna, and swordfish live in water that is just above the freezing point of water (32F 0C).  The &quot;stuff&quot; or enzymes in the meat that make it go bad can still &quot;work&quot; in the refrigerator.   &quot;Land meat&quot; does not spend most of its life in the cold so when &quot;land meat&quot; is put into the fridge the &quot;stuff&quot; in the meat slows way down so it takes way longer for the meat to spoil.</p>
<p>Edit: I see a little confusion in the comments so I will simplify a little further.</p>
<p>Fish are cold blooded and their internal temperature is usually around that the temperature of the water is.  Cows, pigs, chickens, ect are warm blooded.  A cows normal internal temperature is about 101F (38.3C).  Most fish live with an internal temperature much closer to a normal refrigerator's temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
