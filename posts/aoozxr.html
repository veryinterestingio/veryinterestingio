		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Cancer&quot; is not just one disease. It's an umbrella term that encompasses all kinds of uncontrolled cell replication. Every kind of cancer is a different disease with their own possible causes and treatments.</p>
<p>Journalism often fails to make that distinction clearly. When new treatments come around, they are usually relevant to only some cancers, and it takes a long time to go through clinical trials to pin down exactly which cancers it is effective for.</p>
<p>So, lots of treatments for lots of cancers, and they take a long time to develop and test.</p>
<p>Edit:
Some people feel I didn't answer the question well enough. So, the current state of cancer treatment varies a lot depending on the kind of cancer.  Overall, the trend is strongly in favour of better survival rates because the march of progress is going as quickly as it can. For example, prostate cancer survival rates are actually really good nowadays as long as it's found early. On the other hand, pancreatic cancer is still usually a death sentence; that one is still a bigger challenge than most because you don't know you have it until it's too late. Since every kind of cancer is different, it's hard to generalize. Suffice it to say that all of the seemingly fleeting reports about new treatments definitely do bear fruit in the statistical big picture. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many kinds of cancer.  Cancer is uncontrolled cell growth basically.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cancer.org/latest-news/facts-and-figures-2019.html" target="_blank">https://www.cancer.org/latest-news/facts-and-figures-2019.html</a></p>
<p>The thing to understand is that there has been a lot of improvement in cancer treatments and survivability. One article notes reduction in smoking and early detection as two of the reasons.  Cancer mortality has dropped 27% in the last 25 years.</p>
<p>That is no miracle but it is solid improvement.</p>
<p>The interesting thing to think about is that ultimately, if we get really good at treating all the other things that kill you, cancer is likely the thing you will die from.</p>
<p>It's kind of like the catch all mortality disease.  If you take really good care of yourself and you're in great shape at 100 years old, you could still come down with a disease, like ALS for example.  You are sure to die from that one.  Then, suddenly, a cure was found for ALS.  </p>
<p>You would be lucky, but given enough time, eventually one of the cancers will get you.  It's kind of like the body's built in self destruct.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of the problem is that unless you or a close relative has cancer you probably aren’t aware of the treatment options available or the survival rates. </p>
<p>I remember hearing one of these stories about a possible cancer vaccine a few years ago. When my dog got sick a couple years ago they actually offered it as a possible treatment. I was kind of amazed that it actually made to treatments. If my dog wasn’t sick I probably still wouldn’t know that treatment was being used clinically. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
