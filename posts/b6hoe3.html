		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In practical terms, at low energies an electron and positron approaching each other will most likely begin to orbit one another. This object looks a lot like a hydrogen atom, except with a positron instead of a proton. It's called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positronium?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">positronium</a>.</p>
<p>The electron and positron will quickly annihilate from here though. The mean lifetime is .125 nanoseconds if the spins are anti-aligned (annihilate into 2 photons), and 146 ns if the spins are aligned (annihilate into 3 photons). The only way to accurately compute these annihilation rates is with QED, as /u/polidrupa described.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In quantum electrodynamics the particles we call electrons and positrons are the states described by the quantum field in the limit of negligible interactions (i.e. when the particle is too far from any other particles for any significant interaction to occur). In this limit the particles are described by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_field" target="_blank">free field</a> states (a.k.a. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fock_state" target="_blank">Fock states</a>). This is a fancy way to say that, according to this &quot;picture&quot;, speaking about electrons and positrons only makes sense if there is nothing else in the universe (i.e., electrons and positrons -and anything else, really- are not balls).</p>
<p>However, when interactions become significant the states of the quantum field are perturbed away from the free field states. We can calculate this with perturbation theory, to calculate scattering probabilities, but we don't actually know what the states are. So in the annihilation process it isn't really the case that there is one electron and one positron present because the state of the quantum field cannot simply be described as an electron state and a positron state.</p>
<p>If you insist in calling this &quot;electrons&quot; and &quot;positrons&quot;, however, I don't believe there is a theoretical limit on the distance. But bear in mind that in quantum mechanics particles are not point-like; instead, they are &quot;distributed in space&quot; according to the wavefunction, so saying where they are is problematic (because they are in many places at the same time, according to the wavefunction).</p>
<p>A similar question is discussed <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/389213/what-is-the-shortest-distance-between-electron-and-positron-before-they-are-anni" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Particles that small do not really have a position as such, just areas where they are more likely to be than others. These areas are represented by wavefunctions. The interactions of these wavefunctions defines when/if annihilation will occur.</p>
<p>Basically, if you have two circles to represent the possible locations of the particles, then overlapping the two cirlces will have a non-zero chance of annihilating. They do not interact at distance, so I guess you could say that they touch.</p>
<p>Quantum physics is different to classical physics in that it is mostly based on proabability instead of certainty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for all your replies, I asked that question because of a Feynmandiagram of the annihilation between an electron and a positron. In this diagram was a distance but no difference in time between the two particles, so I asked myself why, but now I understand that this is just a model, and that you have to look at an electron like a wave with locationpropabilities, described through the wavefunction (sorry for my english, I hope you can understand me.) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
