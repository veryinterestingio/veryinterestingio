<p>It goes via radio to the nearest cell tower, then by fiber optic line to your cell company, then via data link (probably not the Internet) to your friend's cell company, then by fiber optic to their cell tower and then radio to your friend's phone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not a satellite phone. It doesn't go to space. Your cellphone signal goes wirelessly to the nearest tower, then passed along to a centralized system, processed, then sent to the recipient.</p>
<p>Actual total distance will depend on how far away the tower is and how far from that tower to whatever server system is doing the &quot;thinking&quot; </p>
<p>A GPS uses a satellite signal but it's one-way, it only has to <em>see</em> the satellite to locate you on the map. Cellphone geolocation isn't done by GPS either, it's done by proximity to towers, and it's good enough to tell you when to take the next left.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If your friend lived in another country then it still wouldnâ€™t go via satellite, rather undersea fibre optic cables.</p>
<p>Communication via satellite is much slower as it can take as much as a second or two for a signal to be sent, compared to fractions of a second for fibre optic cables. The reason for this is that the distance to travel are much shorter with undersea cables compared to a satellite and back.</p>
<p>If you were on a phone call the extra delay of satellite communication would be very noticeable where as there is very little delay usually for international phone calls. </p>
<p>The only time you would use satellites to communicate is in remote areas where there are no nearby cell towers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
