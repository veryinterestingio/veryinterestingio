		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a very oversimplified way: the Greek pantheon broadly got merged with the Roman one when the Roman Empire took control of Greece - Jupiter and Zeus or Neptune and Poseidon for example, they were considered comparable. After Christ, Rome for a long time didn’t tolerate what was then his fringe cult of Judaism but then emperor Constantine converted and decriminalised Christianity. </p>
<p>Christianity then became the Empire’s official religion and, thanks to the infrastructure Rome had built up, the influence of it was able to spread from the Holy Land all the way up to France and Britain. A series of crusades brought Christianity to the northeast of Europe over the next centuries, and by about 1000AD Europe was basically totally Christian, save some parts of modern Spain. </p>
<p>This isn’t really comparable to any modern decline in any religion. After the Western Empire fell and Europe fractured into smaller kingdoms Christianity had the home field advantage over more local gods. It had gotten around and had power on its side for a while, and over time its prevalence just stamped out those local deities. The Pope became the EU of the time with kings and dukes referring to him as the representative of God’s will and mediating certain disputes - he gave God’s blessing to the Norman conquest of England, for instance. </p>
<p>Modern day though, humanity has come leaps and bounds in self sufficiency, resilience through hardship and understanding why things happen. We understand the processes behind plagues and disasters and can recover from them much easier now - this, plus access to information, has kind of displaced the need for a higher power. Faith will still live on, the major religions aren’t going anywhere for a while, but with understanding of how these things work we don’t really need a supernatural explanation any more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Did it happen over night? nope took centuries of persecution, murder mutilations and a few crusades to Convert the empire.</p>
<p>Atheism literally means a lack of the belief in the state gods of Rome when Rome Christianized the state god became the christian god. The Greek gods were co-opted to be Roman gods and  they were all part of the empire.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Long rambling over generalized 6 am account of history:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Roman gods were officially changed, empire split between east and west as did the church.</p>
<p>The death of Theodosius I in 395 caused a resurgence of greco-roman polytheism.</p>
<p>Last hold outs of &quot;total conversion&quot; of the Empire  were killed during a 4 year siege by emperor Zeno around 484. They slaughtered the pagan intellectuals so they called it a success!</p>
<p>Centuries of repression rape murder continue despite &quot;total conversion&quot;.</p>
<p>Re-surged again - Islamic threat so meh deal with new guys on the block.</p>
<p>in 804 the Hellenes of Laconia ( Mani Peninsula) resisted conversion and then the eastern Roman empire collapsed so let's bring on the Ottoman repression, rape and murder spiced with times of toleration to add on to the Orthodox and Catholic. Evidence of it still existing comes from the penal codes in regards to   atheist and pagans - basically mutilation and death.</p>
<p>Fragments survive.</p>
<p>Crusade era - sent to wipe  in the 12th and 13th centuries but these were for other pagan groups such as the Balts.</p>
<p>Galindians, Curonians, and Yotvingians  exterminated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let’s posit the Greek gods came to be some centuries before their mention in the Mycenaean Linear B tablets which are dated to around 1500 BCE.   2000 BCE is as good a date as any. Using Constantine as a proposed terminus, that means they had about a 2300 year run more or less. </p>
<p>Christianity as a religion arguably began with St. Paul (50 CE as a date for his writings).  If Christianity has the staying power of the Greco-Roman pantheon, that would place its terminus at 2350 CE. </p>
<p>The Egyptian pantheon had somewhat longer legs, 3000 years or so, which could add a few centuries to these wildly hypothetical calculations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ancient Greeks and Romans had pretty &quot;modern&quot; attitudes about their own religions for hundreds of years before Christianity came along, judging by their own plays, literature and primary accounts.</p>
<p>There was a broad range of philosophical sophistication among them not unlike you'd see in many cultures today, including skepticism and even atheism.  By the time of Christ, we hear the Roman governor of Judaea cynically saying &quot;what is truth?&quot;  And when the apostle Paul comes to Athens he's calling them superstitious, and noticing an altar dedicated &quot;To an Unknown God.&quot;</p>
<p>Anyway it's not clear that our particularly narrow modern sense of <em>belief</em> was so important to ancient religious people.   Or many Christians for that matter.  Modern Westerners tend to think of religious faith as abstract, and religion was much more practical for ancient cultures including Christianity.  </p>
<p>For one thing, ancient pagan religions had no Thomas Aquinas or John Calvin to specify the kind of precise theology we moderns associate with religious belief.   But even in Christianity, all the way through the last two centuries there have been mixtures of pagan practice and belief with Christian practice.</p>
<p>This isn't to say that doctrinal belief isn't essential to Christianity.  It is, but it is probably a different standard than the ancients themselves would want.  The exclusivity of Christian doctrine was, after all, precisely what clashed with Roman society.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
