<p>IIRC there's some tunnel connecting Manhattan with either New Jersey under the Hudson River or Brooklyn under the East River (I don't remember what side) that was built in the late 1800s with two excavation teams from both sides that met in the middle with an error of less than 1 inch. I can't get through my skull how this could be done at the time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They had things like levels and surveyors tools. With a surveyor's kit you could get quite accurate - like to within an inch or two or better.  Read up on how they built cathedrals. Iron right angles, bubble levels, chalk lines, plumb bobs... the tools of stone masonry and carpentry really haven't changed much in over a thousand years. </p>
<p>Furthermore, they couldn't quite build out from the bridge pylons the way they do now with cantilevere'd tower supports etc.. They'd build a pier out in the middle of the river and build it up to a certain level with stone (using my level and surveyors scope from the shoreline to measure the right height). Let it set and remove the wooden caisson they used to dig down to the river bed. Then they'd construct a wodden trestle/framework that spanned from the pier to one shore, while the foundation on that shore is being built. Make both sides of the trestle level is easy enough, then the trestle framework supports the stone until the mortar sets. Rinse/ repeat on the other side, or until you reach the other bank.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of talk about protractors and string here ... that's only partly right. Traditional survey instruments (same principles often used today) measured angles, horizontally and vertically, extremely precisely. Quick precise distance measurement came later, but one carefully measured baseline and a series of intersecting angles can coordinate points better than you'd expect.</p>
<p>GPS isn't as useful as you'd think for surveying in closed-in or covered areas, so we still use similar instruments almost every day. Behind all the software, modern terrestrial survey instruments still just measure horizontal angles, vertical angles, and slope distances. </p>
<p>Leveling is even easier! In fact, if you want to be really basic, you can even do it with water. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The original Huey P Long bridge in New Orleans has a 1.5' &quot;jog&quot; in the roadway about 1/3 the way up the bridge. I suspect it was due to measurement errors. The lanes were super narrow, at 9' wide, with no shoulders and most driver had to grip the steering wheel tightly while traveling the bridge, Especially if an 18 wheeler was next to you.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bridges aren't as precisely sized as you think even today, physics won't let them be</p>
<p>The longest span on the new Tappan Zee is 370 meters long and can change length by 20 cm between a hot summer day and a cold winter day. Bridges are built with expansion joints which let them expand/contract as temperatures change and also take up some slack during construction</p>
<p>With old stone bridges a lot of stones were adjusted for their spots. Have a smaller gap than expected when you get to the middle? Smack the stone with a hammer until it fits! Then add some mortar to take up all the slack. Voila! A bridge that &quot;meets perfectly&quot; in the middle</p>
<p>Our precision measurements let us better understand the load capabilities of structures and make parts in advance so we can build them faster, but every engineering design supports some slop in the final measurements</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
