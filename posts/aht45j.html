		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason they look so similar is because of geometry. The laws dictate the force (electromagnetic or gravitational) felt by a particle at a particular distance. The particle can be located at any location above, below, or to the side so we can see that there is a sphere of equal potential surrounding the first particle. The force felt then is determined by the force per unit area, or flux. </p>
<p>The area is the surface area of a sphere which grows as (4)(pi)(r^2). The 4 pi is built into the constants in the front, leaving the r^2 on the bottom. This leads to a formula that looks very similar for gravity and electromagnetism. Anything that expands as a sphere falls off with the same r^2 term. For instance the intensity of sound, light, or even the intensity of an explosion all fall of as 1/r^2 .</p>
<p>So why is electromagnetism attractive and repulsive and gravity not? Well, electric charge can be either positive or negative which flips the sign of Coulomb’s law. In order to make gravity repulsive, you would need a negative mass which we are pretty sure does not exist by our laws of physics. Thus, we are in turn pretty sure that gravity is a purely attractive force. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Note that there are two huge differences:</p>
<p>The sign. Electric charge of the same charge repel each others. Basically, Coulomb's law tend to build pairs of opposite charge that then act neural. While gravity attract objects of the same sign (we only know particles of positive mass anyway) thus building big packets.</p>
<p>Gravity use the same property as inertia: mass. If there were negative mass particles they would have weird relationship between force and acceleration...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every so and on some theorist comes out with a model with negative gravity, so you're not the only one having these questions. However, these theories are seen as exotic (i.e. a nice exercise but not something where you could produce a real universe without a lot of tuning) </p>
<p>The CERN  even <a href="https://home.cern/news/news/experiments/new-antimatter-gravity-experiments-begin-cern" target="_blank">plans to try to drop an anti-atom</a> to see if it behave the same way as ordinary matter in the earth gravitational field (spoiler most of the people believe so, bus scientists believe only what they can measure) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have negative charge. </p>
<p>So, how about negative mass?  Ok.  What is its kinetic energy at speed v?</p>
<p>EDIT:  by the way, if it isn't clear.  There is an enormous difference between charge q,  and mass m.  Because mass m is fundamental to Newton's laws, and equations of motion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The real reason this occurs is because the EM force is mediated by a spin-1 particle (photon) and the gravitational force is mediated by a spin-2 (graviton). Each of these integer spins gives an extra minus sign once you do the QFT calculation. The extra minus sign from the spin-2 nature causes the diagrams with like “charge” (here for gravity, mass) to attract instead of repel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
