		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you look at a magnified view of the ball part of a ball point pen (Biro), you'll see that it's actually quite rough. The idea is that friction against the paper causes the ball to roll, picking up ink on the inside and transferring it to the paper on the outside.</p>
<p>If the paper becomes too smooth (possibly because of oil on its surface, or because the paper was crushed flat and smooth), the ball doesn't get enough friction to turn, and the entire process stalls.</p>
<p>Edit: looks like they're smoother than I remember.</p>
<p>Edit the second: good lord; how did this ever merit this many upvotes?</p>
<p>Edit the third: gold? Wow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The tiny ball bearing in a pen is lubricated by its own ink, but expecting some friction to keep it rolling. When the pen stops writing its because the friction in the ball is too much, vs whats its trying to overcome on the paper.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Normally the tooth of the paper against the ball of the pen has enough friction for the pen to write, however, as the ball of the pen runs across the tooth of the paper as you write, it also creates the effect of burnishing the paper.</p>
<p>Burnishing is the process of pushing an implement against the tooth of the paper to force the tooth to lay flat, and in doing so the paper becomes smooth.</p>
<p>The ball point relies on friction to function so the burnished paper makes the pen's ball less effective as it will slide on the surface and often times will not write on this smoothed surface, especially if it is already having problems with micro-fine grit in the ball.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
