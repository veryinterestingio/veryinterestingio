		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It appears that you can get it, but never show symptoms.</p>
<p>It also appears that some that tested positive are just tested early, and may develop symptoms in the future.</p>
<p>So you can get it and show no symptoms, the light symptoms of a common cold, or full blown covid-19 symptoms.</p>
<p>TLDR; Both are true. A large portion of people and either never show symptoms or have very mild symptoms that allow for self-recovery at home. This is why social distancing is so important. It should be assumed that anyone and everyone may have it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Turns out people catch far more colds than they think they do. (Colds can also be coronaviruses.) At the end of the study, people had antibodies for colds that they never realized they had. Either they were asymptomatic or had such mild symptoms they never paid attention to them. </p>
<p>That's the immune system doing an excellent job --- to catch a disease but your immune system takes care of it without you even knowing you've got it.</p>
<p>Same thing is happening with this coronavirus. And why not? As I mentioned, the common cold can also be caused by a coronavirus.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of “Typhoid Mary”.</p>
<p>Mary Mallon was born in 1869 in Ireland and emigrated to the US in 1884. She had worked in a variety of domestic positions for wealthy families prior to settling into her career as a cook. As a healthy carrier of Salmonella typhi her nickname of “Typhoid Mary” had become synonymous with the spread of disease, as many were infected due to her denial of being ill. She was forced into quarantine on two separate occasions on North Brother Island for a total of 26 years and died alone without friends, having evidently found consolation in her religion to which she gave her faith and loyalty. “Mary Mallon (1869-1938) and the history of typhoid fever. Filio Marineli, Gregory Tsoucalas, [...], and George Androutsos”</p>
<p>She was forbidden, after her first release, to be a cook - after another round of typhoid breakout occurred, authorities discovered she was once again cooking for upper class families. She was then sentenced again and eventually passed away - not from typhoid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OK, so first, data. Here is a comparison of South Korea age demongraphics for COVID19 compared to Italy. </p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.statcdn.com/Infographic/images/normal/21134.jpeg" target="_blank"><a href="https://cdn.statcdn.com/Infographic/images/normal/21134.jpeg" target="_blank">https://cdn.statcdn.com/Infographic/images/normal/21134.jpeg</a></a> </p>
<p>You will note in the 20-29 bracket in South Korea, reside 30% of the positives. In Italy, only 3.7%. In South Korea they tested contacts. Italy did not.</p>
<p>If you adjust for demographics, you can estimate 25-35% of all COVID19 positives are 15 to 50 years old and asymptomatic. People do not know how long someone stays asymptomatic and transmissible. Accumulating data says a symptomatic person is transmissible for up to 2 days before first symptoms and until a week after. How that translates to an asymptomatic is not know, but 10 days seems like a very generous upper limit on the time range. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>tldr; Asymptomatics are real, and are mostly 20-30 years old, and are a substantial fraction (25-35%) of all people who are transmissible for COVID19.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
