		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They bring the oxygen with them in the rocket! There are two parts to the fuel a rocket carries: the fuel and the oxidizer. The oxidizer is not oxygen gas, it's either a solid compound that plays the same chemical role (like ammonium perchlorate) or a liquid (like liquid oxygen). In fact, rockets need to use the oxidizer while they are still in the atmosphere as well, because they need to burn so much fuel so quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to what others are saying, you don't need an exotic material like hydrazine or a fancy 2-component system like space rockets use, with a separate tank of fuel and tank of oxidizer with a fancy mixing system that combines them.</p>
<p>There is a gif on the front page right now of fireworks p<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/31mrqd/fireworks_under_ice/" target="_blank">ropelling themselves along and exploding under the ice</a> of a frozen pond. This works for the exact same reason as your question. Lots of fuels, like gunpowder and flash powder are molecules or mixtures that contain their own oxygen, and therefore don't need air to burn. Gunpowder/black powder like in the firework fuses is a mixture containing carbon (fuel), and potassium nitrate (oxidizer). That KNO3 contains lots of oxygen (as a solid) which readily reacts with the carbon once you light it.</p>
<p>Many high explosives use this bring-your-own-oxygen principle to an even more extreme level by containing the oxidizer and fuel (carbon) not just mixed together but actually within the same molecule! Eg <a href="https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.691334096.5728/raf,750x1000,075,t,FFFFFF:97ab1c12de.u4.jpg" target="_blank">here's TNT</a>. The reaction happening is still combustion, but because the reactants are held SO close together, the reaction can happen VERY fast and produce all the combustion products rapidly in a tiny area (creating a huge pressure aka explosion).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to u/lmxbftw 's answer, there are some fuels that are called '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopropellant_rocket" target="_blank">monopropellants</a>', in that they don't need external oxygen.  They are not 'fuels' in the normal sense in that they burn with oxygen to produce heat.  The most common is hydrazine (N2H4) which decays in the presence of a catalyst in the engine and the process is quite exothermic (i.e. gets very hot, which is what you want from a propellant).  High concentration hydrogen peroxide is also used.</p>
<p>These are often used for thrusters (orientation or small delta v) since the engines are pretty simple, comparatively.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/news/337/what-was-the-saturn-v/" target="_blank">schematic</a> notice the tanks are marked &quot;LOX&quot;. LOX is liquid oxygen</p>
<p>It and the fuel (kerosene) were stored separately for safety purposes.</p>
<p>You can also have solid state rockets. In these, the oxygen is in solid form and mixed in. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_perchlorate" target="_blank">oxidizer</a> I don't know whether it &quot;gives off&quot; the oxygen or whether it oxidizes the fuel in bound form, or whether it forms intermediate bonds or something. You'll have to do more research on that yourself</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some interesting facts of rockets and what they put out.</p>
<p>The same engine can be designed to work in earth’s atmosphere and in space. They do so by changing the size of the nozzle or what most people actually consider “the rocket engine.”</p>
<p>If it weren’t extremely hot, you could stand under a rocket engine without much effort. The pressure of the exhaust is nearly the same pressure as the surrounding air. </p>
<p>Most rocket engines are fueled by a smaller rocket engine. In order to push the fuel and oxidizer at the rate required for launch, they use a turbo pump powered by that same fuel and oxidizer. Some turbo pumps are run off of electricity instead of the rocket fuels, these batteries are very large, consumed very quickly and used up batteries are dropped off the rocket during ascent.</p>
<p>Rocket engines often don’t run at peak fuel/oxidizer ratios. In order to reduce heat, a lot of oxidizer/fuel mixtures are fuel or oxidizer rich depending on the needs of the rocket.</p>
<p>Most rocket engines keep their nozzles cool by simply running their liquid fuel or oxidizer through tubes encircling the nozzle itself.</p>
<p>Most rockets aren’t designed to support their own weight without the pressurized fuel in their upright configuration. This is why rockets sit on their side until launch, and launch is a several day process to move/plumb/fuel/launch.</p>
<p>SRBs (Solid Rocket Boosters) are more like a very dangerous candle than a traditional rocket. Instead of an engine and liquid fuels, SRBs use a fuel mixed with a solid substrate to make it similar to a large candle. They light the candle from the top and a small channel in the center pushes the exhaust down and out of the nozzle. These are typically used at the start of a rocket launch to give the rocket additional delta-V at sea level. These are also the things people think of as dropping off the rocket during launch. Once the SRBs are empty, they are dead weight, so it’s better to drop them during ascent.</p>
<p>Current limitations of space travel are due to fuels and how much we can lift with current rocket designs. There comes to a point where adding more rocket or more fuel doesn’t give the rocket any more delta-V or cargo capacity.</p>
<p>I am an enthusiast so this info might not apply to every rocket and isn’t a full scope of rockets, just some stuff I wouldn’t have guessed about rockets and the way they work.</p>
<p>If you want to learn a lot about rockets, Scott Manley and Everyday Astronaut are great YouTube channels that go in-depth on how rockets work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
