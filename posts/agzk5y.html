		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was all to do with atmospheric oxygen concentration.*</p>
<p>Arthropods, including insects and crustaceans, more or less lack the active respiratory and closed circulatory systems present in, say, us vertebrates (actively inhaling oxygen, that's then delivered to cells via blood) - rather they use a more passive system, where oxygen enters and is distributed around the body directly by a network of holes (spiracles) and tubes (trachaea) (see <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a5/36/28/a53628b41dc8153ffb29455c92be4897.jpg" target="_blank">this diagram</a>). </p>
<p>As insects become bigger, this type of semi-passive system becomes increasingly less effective, essentially acting as a limit on size after a certain point. Increasingly large insects simply can't get enough oxygen to keep them alive.</p>
<p>This is all true, at least, if the atmospheric concentration of oxygen remains around 21%. If you were to increase atmospheric oxygen, arthropod respiration would become more effective and that maximum imposed size would increase - hence bigger creepy crawlies.</p>
<p>As it happens, during the Carboniferous period some 300 million years ago, it's thought atmospheric oxygen might've peaked at around 35% - hence the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meganeura" target="_blank">gull-sized dragonflies</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropleura" target="_blank">millipedes</a> as long n' wide as a human. </p>
<p>Why did it peak? Not too long before, during the early Devonian (~400mya), the land was largely devoid of the plant biomass we're familiar with today. It was during the mid-Devonian through to the Carboniferous (390-300mya) that terrestrial plant life exploded in size, range and diversity - once largely ankle-high lawns of rudimentary shrubs became dense forests covering large swathes of the globe. It's this explosion in terrestrial photosynthesising plant life that sucked so much carbon out of the atmosphere in such a relatively short span of time, converting it into oxygen, that caused the sharp peak in atmospheric oxygen. </p>
<p>Over time, long-term geologic and oxidative processes began to rebalance that concentration to the levels we're more familiar with today, dragging the maximum size of terrestrial arthropods down with it. As such, the most massive terrestrial insects we see today - such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goliathus" target="_blank"><em>Goliathus</em> beetles</a> - only get as large as a child's fist. Which, I guess, is a good thing - dunno' about you guys, but I quite enjoy not being overrun by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6abcoSUJsNw" target="_blank">giant, flesh-eating spiders</a>, 'innit.</p>
