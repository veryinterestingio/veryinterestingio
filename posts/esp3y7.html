	<title>If humans colonized another planet with substantially longer days than on Earth (ex: 36 hours), would our sleep/wake cycles naturally adjust to 24/12 hours respectively over time to accommodate the new norm, or would the recommended 16/8 hour cycle still apply?</title>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Studies have been done where people are placed in total isolation from the sun and outside cues for time. The people tend to transition to very long sleep / wake cycles if I'm remembering correctly. Something like 30 - 40 hour &quot;days&quot;. There is speculation the body will naturally extend day cycles without sunlight cues in order to keep up with the changing of the seasons, so I expect our bodies would adapt quite easily to variances of day length. Our bio rhythms are so dependant on light that we use it as a way to treat sleep and wake disorders.</p>
<p>Plus there are already lots of places on earth with extended day and night cycles. The closer you get to the poles the more extreme it is. Although they still run on 24 hour schedules, it just goes to show how adaptable people are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Sleep follows a physiological and an ambiental pattern. Our ambiental pattern, which is the circadian rythm, would probably accomodate. Our physiological rhytm would probably stay the same, but it could evolve over time. But I wonder how it would so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I got a friend that was on submarines in the Navy. He told me that they ran on 18-hour days. 6 on watch, 6 for play/study if you’re not qualified yet, 6 for sleep or whatever ratio you wanted for the 12 you weren’t on watch. He said they got used to it rather quickly to the point that once they came off patrol they had a hard time adjusting back to 24-hr days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am paraphrasing some videos by the excellent Isaac Arthur (on YouTube): it's unlikely that humans would biologically change so much for one specific planet. It's of course possible that we could use technology to change our need for sleep. But if we're looking at an interstellar civilization, the question is would people bother adjusting to the day/night cycle of a single planet? There would probably be more People living in orbit and around the system than on the planet, so you might want to keep to a sleep cycle common in the system. However, there might always be some minority willing to change their bodies significantly in order to go fully &quot;native&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
