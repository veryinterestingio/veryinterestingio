To ELI5 it:
First, you need to know that egg cells are surrounded by a thick layer of jelly-like goop (Zona Pellucida) Sperm cells have to burrow through that goop to actually reach the egg itself. The first sperm to make it through the goop to the egg sends its genetic information into the egg cell. This triggers a kind of intruder alarm, which releases chemicals (enzymes) that turn the jelly-goop into a hard, thick shell. Any sperm that was still in the goop is now trapped, and any sperm that is late to the party has found the door closed. This makes sure that only one sperm can actually make it to the egg.</p>
<p>Edit: Because a lot of people are asking about twins and how they come about: </p>
<p>Identical twins are the result of 1 egg + 1 sperm- very early on in development the ball of cells that will become a baby (these are stem cells, cells that can become any part of the baby or the placenta, they haven’t ‘chosen’ a job yet) splits into two balls of cells, each of which develop into their own baby. Since these babies started from the same fertilized egg, they will be genetically identical. </p>
<p>Fraternal twins are the results of 2 eggs + 2 sperm, each fertilized egg will develop into its own unique baby. This can happen because Mom ovulated two eggs at the same time (the tendency to do this runs in families!). This also means that you can have fraternal twins with different dads, if Mom had more than one set of sperm around when the eggs were available. Fraternal twins are no different than any other set of siblings (genetically) except that they happened to share a womb. </p>
<p>Bigger sets of multiples are usually a combination of both processes, or the result of fertility treatments like IVF. For example, triplets may be caused by 2 eggs + 2 sperm then one of them splits (so 2 identical babies, plus a 3rd fraternal triplet), 3 eggs + 3 sperm, or, most rare, 1 egg + 1 sperm that then splits, and splits again to make three identical embryos.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey, this sounds like a question for me! I'm a researcher studying cell division mechanisms, including meiosis (the process of getting egg or sperm cells ready for fertilisation).</p>
<p>There are several ways to prevent polyspermy (when an egg gets fertilised by multiple sperm cells). The first is that although millions of sperm cells are ejaculated, they need to make their way to the egg, which is not easy. In the end, only a few hundred sperm cells will be able to reach the egg.</p>
<p>Second, there is the cortical reaction. There is a thick, gelatinous coat around the egg called the zona pellucida, which sperm cells have to get through before being able to fertilise the egg. This slows down the sperm a lot. As soon as one sperm has managed to make its way through the zona pellucida and fertilise the egg, the egg immediately triggers the release of an enzyme that causes the zona pellucida to harden. This stops any further sperm cells from making their way though it. This is considered the &quot;slow block&quot;, as the cortical reaction can take a little while to occur.</p>
<p>Third, there is depolerisation of the egg's plasma membrane. This is considered the &quot;fast block&quot;. It is a little more complicated to explain, but once a sperm cell has made its way through the zona pellucida, it must still get through the membrane of the egg. This membrane has properties that allow for a sperm cell to bind it and get through when the egg is unfertilised. As soon as a sperm cell has got through the membrane, it &quot;depolerises&quot;, which (in simple terms) changes the properties of the membrane. Even if other sperm cells had managed to make their way through the zona pellucida, they would no longer be able to bind the membrane and penetrate it. This happens on a very short time scale, so it is considered the fast block to polyspermy.</p>
<p>I happen to have studied these very mechanisms. In humans, they are extremely important because if an egg is fertilised by multiple sperm, the outcome will be a spontaneous abortion. The fertilised egg would simply not be viable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
